August is upon us, which means the summer is starting to wind down. But that doesn’t mean that game releases are slowing down! Here is a list of the biggest games releasing in August 2022.
#Gaming #SaintsRow #MaddenNFL23 

Football is back and has once again managed to improve on last year’s game.

Perhaps the biggest new feature in Madden NFL 23 is the "Fieldsense" system that EA promises will deliver "more control at all positions in every mode." EA said this new system will help deliver "ultra-realistic gameplay," including new animations and player control mechanics.

Madden NFL 23 also updates Face of the Franchise with a new experience called The League. There will be new position-specific mechanics and player-focused cameras. Franchise mode, meanwhile, will offer "simplified" team-building mechanics.

In terms of visuals, Madden NFL 23 aims to offer a "new level of visual realism" in all stages of the football experience. There will be new "player-locked, 4K touchdown cameras" that aim to match what the latest NFL TV broadcasts offer.

You can continue to secretly pretend you’re Tom Brady when Madden NFL 23 drops on August 19 for PC and every console except Switch.

Soul Hackers 2 is the follow-up to Demon Summoner: Soul Hackers, itself a sci-fi spin-off in the Shin Megami Tensei franchise.

Set in the same world as Soul Hackers without continuing that tale, you play as Ringo, a character created by a sentient artificial intelligence and dispatched to stop some coming event from ending the world. With Soul Hackers 2, you're dealing with a group of characters who are older, rather than those making their way through high school. But this is also a supernatural sci-fi RPG, so expect some fantastical elements; for instance, there are demons, and you summon them.

According to Atlus, while the first Soul Hackers had a pretty hardcore RPG bend that might have turned off some players, the sequel is looking to be a little more welcoming, while also seemingly borrowing a lot of what works from recent successes like Persona 5 to present a new story.

You can summon some demons when Soul Hackers 2 comes to PC and every console except Switch on August 25.

So which of these games are you most interested in? Are there any that you can’t wait to play that didn’t make the list? Let us know in the comments and stay tuned to GameSpot for more.

Also new this month is Marvel’s Avengers and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2. We also make recommendations on what to queue up from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog, because everyone’s got a backlog, right?

Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series has consistently been one of the most beloved and successful open world RPG's. And, while we eagerly wait for Elder Scrolls VI, here is a loving look back at Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is the story of Skyrim as told by its fans.

Join Adam Mason, Dave Jewitt, and Kurt Indovina of GameSpot, Cam Robinson, DaveControl, ESO Danny, Super BunnyHop, Lucy James of Giant Bomb, FudgeMuppet, Rycon Roleplays, and Shirley Curry as they discuss the impact Skyrim has had on them and the gaming industry as a whole in this love letter to Elder Scrolls V.

While Skyrim wasn't the Elder Scrolls game that established the series as an open-world RPG great, and many will argue over if Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim did it best, its tremendous success and impact can't be denied. The cold, northern region of Tamriel has become the home of many stories, and the epic sweeping soundtrack of Skyrim not only contains incredible tracks to relax to as you explore, but of course, Dovahkiin - the perfect ode to a Dragonborn.

Cam Robinson, Adam Mason, and Dave Jewitt discuss the meme of being a stealth archer in Skyrim, while Super BunnyHop, Rycon Roleplays, FudgeMuppet, and Shirley Curry discuss roleplaying in Skyrim. Lucy James and SuperBunnyHop chat about Skyrim Mods, while Kurt and Rycon Roleplays chat about how great the Dark Brotherhood quests are.

Enjoy the 2nd episode of I :heart: Gaming. If you missed it, check out our first episode on Dark Souls, featuring: Adam Mason, Brad Ellis of Easy Allies, Caddicarus, Chris Morris, Dave Jewitt, DaveControl, Gav Murphy and Rory Powers of RKG, Super BunnyHop, HeyZeusHeresToast, Iron Pineapple, Jessie Gender, LobosJR, Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain of Giant Bomb, Marz, Otzdarva, Prod, Quelaag, and Sinclair and Sophie of SinclairLore.

## Sony Won't Rule Out PS5 Price Increase | GameSpot News

Could the PlayStation 5 be getting more expensive? Plus Steam Deck availability is improving, Genshin Impact teases its 3.0 update, and and the Analogue Pocket is getting some new features.
#Gaming #PS5 #PlayStation5 

Could a PlayStation 5 price hike actually happen? Plus, exciting Steam Deck news, a Genshin Impact 3.0 tease and new updates to the Analogue Pocket on today’s GameSpot News.

The PlayStation 5 is flying off store shelves, but--due to supply chain issues and other factors--the system has not been able to match the sales success of the PlayStation 4 thus far.

Sony's latest earnings briefing shows that the PS5’s lifetime has reached 21.7 million since launch in November 2020. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, reached 25.4 million units after its first seven quarters on the market.

During a call with investors, Sony was asked about a potential PS5 price increase, something the company has done in Japan with other products, including speakers, headphones, and cameras, due to various factors

According to VGC's translation of comments made CFO Hiroki Totoki, Sony isn't prepared to comment on the possibility of a PS5 price hike. "About a potential price increase for the PS5, at this point in time there is nothing specific I can share with you about prices," the executive said.

While a price increase would be an unprecedented move for a console, we did just see this happen with the Meta Quest 2, which it itself is getting a $100 price hike in August.

If you’ve been struggling to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, and have been eyeing a Steam Deck, some great news from Valve! The company put out a statement that it will be able to meet demand sooner than estimated, and that anyone with a current reservation will be receiving their handheld by the end of the year.
