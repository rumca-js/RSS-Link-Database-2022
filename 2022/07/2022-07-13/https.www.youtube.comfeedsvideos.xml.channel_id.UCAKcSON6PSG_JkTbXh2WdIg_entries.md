After releasing "A Legacy of Rentals" — his fifth solo album — in May of this year, Craig Finn is now on tour in support of the record. His first show took place at the Turf Club in St. Paul on June 28, and on that day, Finn and his band The Uptown Controllers visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Ayisha Jaffer. Following the session, Craig Finn sat down for a conversation with host Ayisha Jaffer, where the two talked about the new album and about singing and songwriting, as well as chatting about dogs and sharing some stories about scars.
