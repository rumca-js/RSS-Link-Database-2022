PlayStation Stars rewards you for playing, Skate is going free-to-play, Multiversus is getting an open beta, and Rumbleverse gets a launch date.
#Gaming #PlayStation #PS5 

I’m seeing Stars! PlayStation Stars! Learn all about PlayStation’s new rewards program, as well as Multiversus, Skate, and Rumbleverse updates on today’s GameSpot News.

In its latest attempt to match Xbox’s offerings, PlayStation is instituting a rewards program it is dubbing PlayStation Stars. Think of it like challenges in a video game. Simply logging on and playing will get you rewards, but there will be specific campaigns and activities you’ll be able to complete for greater winnings. These bounties can then be cashed in for things like PSN wallet funds or items in the PlayStation Store. PS Plus subscribers will also receive points for making digital purchases.

PlayStation will also be offering digital collectibles, which in this day and age, sounds a lot like NFTs, but Sony’s PlayStation Network head Grace Chen assures us they’re not. Chen told the Washington Post, “It's definitely not NFTs. Definitely not. You can't trade them or sell them. It is not leveraging any blockchain technologies and definitely not NFTs."

Wow, three definitely nots! It sounds like players have successfully scared off Sony from going anywhere near the blockchain. We did it! Great job, gamers!

PlayStation Stars early tests are being conducted as we speak, with a full rollout for every user coming later this year.

The next Skate is going to launch as a free-to-play title. In an interview with GameSpot, the game’s creative directors explained that the choice to move to that model was made in order to remove barriers to entry for anyone who wants to experience the game. Skate will be supported over time with content drops such as new gameplay elements and seasonal events. And yes, it will be cross play and progression on PC and console, both current and previous gen, as well as an eventual mobile version of the game.

The interview goes on to explain how this new live-service version of Skate retains the spirit of the original titles, as well as how it’s evolved. A link to the interview is in the description below.

Bayonetta 3 is out this year, more games are coming to the new PlayStation Plus, and Metal Gear Solid games may be returning to digital storefronts.
#Gaming #Bayonetta3 #MetalGearSolid 

Bayonetta fans, rejoice! The franchise’s third installment is coming very soon. Plus, more games are coming to PlayStation… Plus! All this and more on today’s GameSpot News.

Bayonetta 3 is releasing this year, on October 28th. This upcoming December would mark the 5th anniversary of its reveal at the 2017 Game Awards, that initial announcement happening nearly four years after the release of Bayonetta 2, so fans have been desperately awaiting this release.

In this third installment, Bayonetta will be teaming up with her fellow Umbra Witches to face a new threat, the Homunculi. The game will allow players to also take control of a new character, Viola, as well as giving Bayonetta new abilities such as Demon Masquerade, where the titular character powers up by fusing with an Infernal Demon.

But that’s not all! A collector’s edition of the game, called the Trinity Masquerade edition, will be available for diehard fans, including an art book and swappable game case sleeves that when put together form a triptych image.

In what might be the most amusing news to come out of this announcement is the game’s “Naive Angel Mode.” Bayonetta is well known outside of the games’ playbase to the wider community thanks majorly in part to its… risque nature. 

But fret not, all you prude gamers out there. The Naive Angel Mode, AKA the horny police, is here to help. With Naive Angel Mode turned on, many of the game’s scantily clad characters, includings Bayonetta herself, will be provided a few more scraps of cloth to cover up their most sensitive areas. Developer Platinum Games notes that this will hopefully make it easier playing the game in the living room "without creating an awkward atmosphere." 

If only we had Naive Angel Mode for all the sex scenes in movies while watching with your parents. Think of all the internal trauma that could have been avoided.

We got to check out a hands-off preview of The Division: Resurgence, a mobile stand-alone game canonically set in the world of Ubisoft's cover based loot shooter. The graphics maybe inferior, but the game has a lot to unpack as we break down what you can expect from the mobile game.

#gaming #ubisoft #TheDivision #TomClancy #DivisionResurgence #ios #mobile #mobilegaming 

GameSpot recently got a chance to see Ubisoft’s upcoming mobile game, The Division Resurgence, in action and speak with executive producer Fabrice Navrez about its development. Much like its console and PC counterpart, Resurgence is a third-person looter-shooter that takes place in New York following the release of the devastating Green Poison. The game can be played cooperatively, but also offers competitive Skirmish and Domination modes as well as a dedicated Dark Zone.

Resurgence is a canonical entry in The Division franchise taking place both during and after the events of the first game. The third-person shooting gameplay is familiar with players taking cover on dilapidated city streets and using various abilities to get an edge over the enemy. At the beginning of the game, you choose your specialization, or class, and over the course of the game, you unlock different specializations and can swap between them. For example, the Vanguard specialization can highlight enemies for your team to see and the Demolitionist can use seeker mines to take them down, among other explosive weapons. Six specializations will be available at launch, according to Navrez. In the gameplay showcased, we saw players throwing up cover to get into better shooting positions and dropping remote turrets to help against enemies. The Freeman are also well-equipped, and can use items like remote-controlled drones.

The Division Resurgence will be entering closed alpha soon on iOS and Android mobile devices.
