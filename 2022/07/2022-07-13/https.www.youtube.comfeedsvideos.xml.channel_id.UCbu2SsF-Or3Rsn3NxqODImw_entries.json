PlayStation Stars! Learn all about PlayStation\u2019s new rewards program, as well as Multiversus, Skate, and Rumbleverse updates on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nIn its latest attempt to match Xbox\u2019s offerings, PlayStation is instituting a rewards program it is dubbing PlayStation Stars. Think of it like challenges in a video game. Simply logging on and playing will get you rewards, but there will be specific campaigns and activities you\u2019ll be able to complete for greater winnings. These bounties can then be cashed in for things like PSN wallet funds or items in the PlayStation Store. PS Plus subscribers will also receive points for making digital purchases.\n\nPlayStation will also be offering digital collectibles, which in this day and age, sounds a lot like NFTs, but Sony\u2019s PlayStation Network head Grace Chen assures us they\u2019re not. Chen told the Washington Post, \u201cIt's definitely not NFTs. Definitely not. You can't trade them or sell them. It is not leveraging any blockchain technologies and definitely not NFTs.\"\n\nWow, three definitely nots! It sounds like players have successfully scared off Sony from going anywhere near the blockchain. We did it! Great job, gamers!\n\nPlayStation Stars early tests are being conducted as we speak, with a full rollout for every user coming later this year.\n\nThe next Skate is going to launch as a free-to-play title. In an interview with GameSpot, the game\u2019s creative directors explained that the choice to move to that model was made in order to remove barriers to entry for anyone who wants to experience the game. Skate will be supported over time with content drops such as new gameplay elements and seasonal events. And yes, it will be cross play and progression on PC and console, both current and previous gen, as well as an eventual mobile version of the game.\n\nThe interview goes on to explain how this new live-service version of Skate retains the spirit of the original titles, as well as how it\u2019s evolved. A link to the interview is in the description below.\n\nTIME CODES: \n00:13 - PlayStation Stars\n01:23 - Skate free-to-play\n02:01 - Multiversus open beta\n02:56 - Rumbleverse release date", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQUd8qY1AwE", "date_published": "2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bayonetta 3 - Official HD Release Date Reveal Trailer", "description": "Check out some brand new gameplay in the release date reveal trailer for Bayonetta 3! Bayonetta is releasing on the Nintendo Switch on October 28, 2022!\n\nBayonetta makes her way through multiple locations in an all-new, over-the-top action game. The Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and Witch Time ability. This time, invading manmade bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta\u2019s crosshairs.\n\n#Bayonetta3 #NintendoSwitch #Bayonetta", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnLEKI6S0JA", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bayonetta 3 Finally Gets A Release Date | GameSpot News", "description": "Bayonetta 3 is out this year, more games are coming to the new PlayStation Plus, and Metal Gear Solid games may be returning to digital storefronts.\n#Gaming #Bayonetta3 #MetalGearSolid \n\nBayonetta fans, rejoice! The franchise\u2019s third installment is coming very soon. Plus, more games are coming to PlayStation\u2026 Plus! All this and more on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nBayonetta 3 is releasing this year, on October 28th. This upcoming December would mark the 5th anniversary of its reveal at the 2017 Game Awards, that initial announcement happening nearly four years after the release of Bayonetta 2, so fans have been desperately awaiting this release.\n\nIn this third installment, Bayonetta will be teaming up with her fellow Umbra Witches to face a new threat, the Homunculi. The game will allow players to also take control of a new character, Viola, as well as giving Bayonetta new abilities such as Demon Masquerade, where the titular character powers up by fusing with an Infernal Demon.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all! A collector\u2019s edition of the game, called the Trinity Masquerade edition, will be available for diehard fans, including an art book and swappable game case sleeves that when put together form a triptych image.\n\nIn what might be the most amusing news to come out of this announcement is the game\u2019s \u201cNaive Angel Mode.\u201d Bayonetta is well known outside of the games\u2019 playbase to the wider community thanks majorly in part to its\u2026 risque nature. \n\nBut fret not, all you prude gamers out there. The Naive Angel Mode, AKA the horny police, is here to help. With Naive Angel Mode turned on, many of the game\u2019s scantily clad characters, includings Bayonetta herself, will be provided a few more scraps of cloth to cover up their most sensitive areas. Developer Platinum Games notes that this will hopefully make it easier playing the game in the living room \"without creating an awkward atmosphere.\" \n\nIf only we had Naive Angel Mode for all the sex scenes in movies while watching with your parents. Think of all the internal trauma that could have been avoided.\n\nTIME CARDS: \n00:14 - Bayonetta 3\n01:57 - PlayStation Plus games\n02:30 - Metal Gear Solid returning games", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvDaBgiAk0", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Division Resurgence - How Well Does It Work On Mobile?", "description": "We got to check out a hands-off preview of The Division: Resurgence, a mobile stand-alone game canonically set in the world of Ubisoft's cover based loot shooter. The graphics maybe inferior, but the game has a lot to unpack as we break down what you can expect from the mobile game.\n\n#gaming #ubisoft #TheDivision #TomClancy #DivisionResurgence #ios #mobile #mobilegaming \n\nGameSpot recently got a chance to see Ubisoft\u2019s upcoming mobile game, The Division Resurgence, in action and speak with executive producer Fabrice Navrez about its development. Much like its console and PC counterpart, Resurgence is a third-person looter-shooter that takes place in New York following the release of the devastating Green Poison. The game can be played cooperatively, but also offers competitive Skirmish and Domination modes as well as a dedicated Dark Zone.\n\nResurgence is a canonical entry in The Division franchise taking place both during and after the events of the first game. The third-person shooting gameplay is familiar with players taking cover on dilapidated city streets and using various abilities to get an edge over the enemy. At the beginning of the game, you choose your specialization, or class, and over the course of the game, you unlock different specializations and can swap between them. For example, the Vanguard specialization can highlight enemies for your team to see and the Demolitionist can use seeker mines to take them down, among other explosive weapons. Six specializations will be available at launch, according to Navrez. In the gameplay showcased, we saw players throwing up cover to get into better shooting positions and dropping remote turrets to help against enemies. The Freeman are also well-equipped, and can use items like remote-controlled drones.\n\nThe Division Resurgence will be entering closed alpha soon on iOS and Android mobile devices.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V23KS3kUao", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
