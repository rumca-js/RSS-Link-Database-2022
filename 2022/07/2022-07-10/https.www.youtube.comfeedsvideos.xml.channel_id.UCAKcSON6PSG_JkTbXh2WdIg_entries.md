Minneapolis art-pop band Poliça are known for innovation, forward-thinking artistry, and novel electronic soundscapes. The 11-year-old band’s new record, "Madness," takes them a step forward into the creative realm with producer Ryan Olson’s new anthropomorphic production tool AllOvers. Originally created as an art installation for the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art with the help of sound artist Seth Rossetter, AllOvers was designed to ingest sounds, including conversations and environmental noise, and turn them into melodies and/or beats.

Not long after the release of "Madness," Poliça — Channy Leaneagh, vocals; Chris Bierden, bass; and Ben Ivascu and Drew Christopherson, drums — visited The Current studio for a session on The Local Show hosted by Diane, during which they played two songs.
