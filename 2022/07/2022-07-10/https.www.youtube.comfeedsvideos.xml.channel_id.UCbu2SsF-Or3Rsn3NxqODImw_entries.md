According to recent job listings, the company is currently looking to hire for an "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title" that seems to be aiming for single-player experience. The open positions include: a Senior Systems Engineer that will design, build, and maintain technology that enables the team to create engaging gameplay and fantastic experiences." As well as a Hard Surface Artist to “help build a brand new Respawn single-player adventure."

Since the lead up to the release of PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, $70 price tags have been a bit of a heated conversation amongst gamers. Following the reveal of The Last of Us Part 1 remake at Summer Game Fest last month, many fans questioned if the high price tag is worth it for an old game that already got a remastered version last generation. 

Robert Morrison, one of the animators that worked on the remake, took to Twitter to address claims that the PS5 version is just a cash grab and said, “The price of the game is out of my control and worth is subjective to each individual. You can decide for yourself if you want it or not. All I’m saying is I am in awe of the work that an amazing group of people did on the project. A tremendous amount of passion was put into it.”


Blizzard has announced that it is officially ending the development of new content for its MOBA Heroes of the Storm. However that doesn’t mean the game as a whole is coming to an end. Blizzard said its focus will become making sure the game continues to run smoothly with bug fixes, balance updates and more.
