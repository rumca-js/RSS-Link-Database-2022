and they suddenly were exposed with this lack of prior immunity to a whole battery of new infections.\n\nProf Emma Thomson, University of Glasgow\n\nLarger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.\n\nWe also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored,\n\nit may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, \n\nleading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children\n\n\nClass II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele\n\nIdentified in 8/9 cases (89%)\n\n(background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors)\n\nAdeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) mutations\n\nMay be significant\n\n9 capsid gene mutations over-represented in these cases\n\naltered phenotype, including substantial evasion of neutralising antibodies directed against wild-type AAV2,\n\nenhanced production yields, \n\nincreased virion stability.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1rCxsG0IkI", "date_published": "2022-07-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Global childhood deaths will increase", "description": "Millions of routine vaccinations missed because of covid disruptions.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and global childhood vaccinations\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2022-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-largest-continued-backslide-in-vaccinations-in-three-decades\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic fuels largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades\n\nGlobal vaccination coverage continued to decline in 2021, \n\nData WHO and UNICEF\n\nDiphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTP3)\n\n5% down between 2019 and 2021\n\n25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP in 2021\n\n18 million, zero doses\n\nIndia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Philippines, Myanmar, Mozambique\n\ndevastating but preventable diseases\n\nFactors\n\nChildren living in conflict and fragile settings\n\nIncreased misinformation\n\nCOVID-19 related issues\n\nService and supply chain disruptions\n\nResource diversion\n\nContainment measures, limited service access\n\nCatherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director\n\nThis is a red alert for child health. \n\nWe are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. \n\nThe consequences will be measured in lives\n\nWe need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, \n\nmore sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine\n\nGlobal coverage of first dose of HPV vaccine, 15%\n\nA backdrop of rapidly rising rates of severe acute malnutrition\n\nWeakened immunity and missed vaccinations\n\na child survival crisis \n\nFirst dose measles coverage\n\nDropped to 81% in 2021\n\n24.7 million children missed first measles dose\n\n5.3 million more than in 2019\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2022-unicef-and-who-warn-of--perfect-storm--of-conditions-for-measles-outbreaks--affecting-children\n\nJanuary and February 2022\n\n17,338 measles cases\n\nJanuary and February 2021\n\n 9,665 measles cases\n\n2018\n\n140,000 measles deaths\n\nmostly among children under the age of five\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles\n\nNZ\nhttps://www.nzno.org.nz/resources/nursing_reports/pid/4779/ev/1/categoryid/25/categoryname/nursing-shortages\n\nNinety-nine percent of responding members said the system was either in crisis (70%) or already beyond crisis (29%)\n\nEnd of Life Choice Act 2019 \n\nhttps://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/life-stages/assisted-dying-service/information-health-professionals/roles-delivery-service\n\n7 November 2021, terminal illness, meet specific criteria, ask for help to end life.\n\nhttps://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0067/latest/DLM7285905.html\n\nNFRs\n\nThe administration of assisted dying medication can only be done by a medical practitioner, or a nurse practitioner\n\nEuthanasia and assisted suicide", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVWOFDncJEE", "date_published": "2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
