In many ways, Disney Dreamlight Valley looks to Nintendo's Animal Crossing for guidance. Dig below the surface and you'll find Dreamlight Valley does many things in its own way.

Players who want to get in the game during its early access period can buy the Founder's Pack, with more details on that to come at a later date.

If you haven't heard by now, the farm-life sim genre that gave us classics such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley is getting a new entry soon. Disney Dreamlight Valley is, in large part, exactly what it sounds like: a House of Mouse spin on the popular genre where characters such as Isabelle and Tom Nook are replaced by Princess Jasmine and Scrooge McDuck. 

In many ways, Disney Dreamlight Valley looks to Nintendo's dominant life sim for guidance, which means the two games play a lot alike in some regards. For example, both drop you into the world as a newcomer inheriting a fixer-upper of a home in a town full of friendly faces eager for a meet-and-greet. Both also let you live out your days on your own schedule with activities like fishing, mining, shopping, cooking, and more.

## Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels Review

Hot Wheels returns to Forza Horizon with more track types and an even larger map to speed through, but its strict progression is an unwelcome speed bump. 

The Forza Horizon series has already crossed over with numerous franchises, from the building blocks of Lego to the family in Fast and The Furious, but it's the one with Hot Wheels and Forza Horizon 3 that sticks out the most when looking back. The combination of Horizon's blisteringly fast cars and the creativity of Hot Wheels twisty tracks was an unsurprising hit, making its return in Forza Horizon 5 an anticipated one. It's an expansion that manages to deliver the same thrill as before, with new track types and a much larger map, but also a structure to progression hampers the pacing.

with no money down via Verizon, and more PSVR 2 details, on today’s GameSpot News.

On Sunday, August 7, the Call of Duty League will be giving away beta codes for Modern Warfare II to lucky attendees of that day’s championship matches, either in person at the Galen Center in Los Angeles or viewing online via livestream.

If you’re watching online, you'll need to stream at least 60 minutes of the broadcast, at which point you'll be entered into a random prize draw for one of the early beta access codes.

Other methods for gaining early access to the beta include the usual preorder model, with Activision confirming that PlayStation owners will be able to play the beta five days earlier than any other platform. No official details on when the beta begins, but insiders have unofficially stated that mid-September is the targeted date, with the full game dropping on October 28.

Until then, you can check out the Mercenaries of Fortune update for Warzone starting tomorrow, July 27. The Model T-800 and T-1000 Terminators will be available via operator bundles, zombies are coming to rebirth island, and more. On the mobile side of Call of Duty, a Ghost in the Shell crossover will be coming to the phone and tablet based shooter on August 3.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Review

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is another heartfelt adventure paired with some of the best combat in the series.

The premise of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bit unusual, but it sets the stage for a 100-hour epic through a fascinating world with strong characters and rewarding combat. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 may stumble from time to time, particularly in its dialogue, but its ambitious premise pays off with a heartfelt conclusion.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is, oddly enough, the fourth game in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, all of which are loosely tied to the long-running sci-fi fantasy ‘Xeno’ franchise. As Monolith Soft’s director, Tetsuya Takahashi, put it in an interview with Time in 2015: “The ‘Xeno’ name […] really just exists to make it clear that these are Tetsuya Takahashi productions.”

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 comes to Nintendo Switch on July 29, 2022.

## Black Panther Game Being Published By Electronic Arts | GameSpot News

Black Panther is getting a standalone game, Multiversus is really popular, and Xbox boot times are getting faster.
 #Gaming #BlackPanther #Marvel 

 

Movies are not the only thing Marvel fans have to look forward to. It seems a key Avenger is getting their own, single player game. That, plus Multiversus updates, on today’s GameSpot News.

It seems Wakanda Forever truly means it, because after the release of the film, we’ll be reportedly getting a Black Panther video game. Hot on the heels of the MCU film’s emotional trailer, Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb has revealed a few details on this early in development title.

The game, codenamed Project Ranier, is said to be coming from a brand new studio based in Seattle founded by former Monolith Productions VP and studio head Kevin Stephens, published under Electronic Arts. Under Stephens, Monolith Productions created the two open-world Lord of the Rings titles Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War, and that studio is now working on a Wonder Woman game that was revealed at last year’s Game Awards.

Two words that define that Wonder Woman title also pertain to Black Panther: single player and open-world. Grubb claims that the game will act as an origin story, the new Black Panther working to assume the mantle soon after the passing of its previous bearer. In nearly every popular iteration of the character, that is the passing of the mantle from Wakandan King T’Chaka to his son T’Challa, but Grubb could not confirm if that will be the case in this game. Perhaps this Black Panther game is set in the past or the future and follows one of T’Challa’s ancestors or predecessors, respectively?

Unfortunately, don’t expect to learn any further details of this game any time soon, as Grubb claims it is in very early development.

To while away the time until more Black Panther video game news, maybe jump into the Multiversus open beta, which starts tomorrow after a week of early access. Despite being available to a limited number of people, the game has proved incredibly popular over the last week.

According to eventshub.com, since the launch of the game in early access, the platform fighter has an average of over 38,000 Steam players online at any given time and an all-time peak of over 61,000. That average is higher than the near 29,000 average of the 13 next most popular fighting games on Steam from the last month.

Of course, Multiversus’ success can be attributed to the fact that it is a taste of an upcoming release, plus the very robust marketing campaign Warner Bros. has put behind it, including partnering with streamers to promote the game. But even still, these numbers are very impressive considering that it wasn't available to everyone.

With early access now being lifted, it stands to reason that concurrent player count will only increase. Particularly as the open beta be adding Lebron James to the roster.

Now, this is Lebron James the character from Space Jam: A New Legacy, not the actual basketball player Lebron James, much like Buzz Lightyear in Lightyear was the space explorer that the toy Buzz Lightyear was based off of. Hopefully that clears things up.

The best way to play the Multiversus open beta might be on Xbox, which is getting an awesome stealth update that cuts the Series X and S boot times by around 5 seconds. This is thanks to a shorter boot up animation sequence that is now available to Xbox Insiders.

Of course, with a four second boot animation, that still means if you drop a piece of food on the floor at the exact time you turn on your Xbox, and it completes before you pick it up, I’m sorry, but you have to discard that food, and that’s the law.

Battlefield 3 has a new Reality Mod that reworks the entire gameplay loop of Battlefield as you know it while retaining the classic maps and destruction gameplay mechanics. We break down all the significant changes and new tweaks that FPS fans.
#Battlefield3 #RealityMod #VeniceUnleashed #Alpha 

 If you're a battlefield fan, particularly a battlefield 3 fan, you may have heard about Venice Unleashed's reality mod. Although the build is incredibly rough around the edges and really punishing, there's also something kinda infectious if you have a proper squad. I'm gonna break down what makes the gameplay just so "realistic" in this mod and how it all works. Drop that like button and sub to the channel especially if you’re excited for future Call of Duty or Battlefield updates.

This mod was countless years in the making by some passionate and dedicated people, and I've been deep in the trenches trying to figure out how the gameplay loop works.  Fans of classic Battlefield or Call of Duty games – check your expectations at the door. I'm serious. You might feel more at home here if you come from Arma, Squad or Tarkov.

If there are some neat gameplay mechanics, I forgot to mention that if you enjoyed in this mod, feel free to hop into the comments! Again, this is a mode for players ready to go all in, role-play a bit, and may have some experience in games like Squad or Tarkov. That being said, if you've never played those games, maybe give this mod a shot, and who knows, you might just enjoy it.
