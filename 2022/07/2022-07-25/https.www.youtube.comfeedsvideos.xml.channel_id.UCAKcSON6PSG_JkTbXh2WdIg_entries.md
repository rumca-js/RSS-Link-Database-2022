About Seratones’ latest album, Love & Algorhythms (out on New West Records), frontwoman AJ Haynes explains, “This is a protest album built on the form of protest I’m most interested in at this moment: getting present and sitting through difficult things with abundant joy.”

That joy is readily evident in a MicroShow Seratones performed at the Hook & Ladder Theater and Lounge in Minneapolis on Saturday, April 9. The audience was composed of lucky winners who had entered for a chance to win passes to this one-of-a-kind show. 

“It is such a delight to be here, it really is,” Haynes told the audience at the Hook & Ladder. “I am so proud to be a human being despite all the craziness going on in the world. This is a celebration of us.”

The Current’s MicroShow series is supported by New Belgium Brewing Company.
