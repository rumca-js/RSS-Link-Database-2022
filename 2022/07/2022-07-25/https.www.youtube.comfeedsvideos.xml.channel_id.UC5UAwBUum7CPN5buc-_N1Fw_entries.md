It's a very, very small box made mostly out of plastic. Basically a small cube at about 13 cm length and width, and 5 cm in height.

The only branding is the Minisforum logo on the top, and a sticker that tells you how to open the device. unfortunately, that sticker is very, very sticky, and removing it left tons of glue marks.

There are multiple configuration you can get: an 8GB of RAM / 128 GB of storage, for 299, a 8 / 256 GB model, for 339, a 16 / 512 GB model, or a 16 / 256 GB model, that respectively cost 399 and 369.

Also in the box is the power cable and brick, and HDMI cable, a displayport cable, and a mounting bracket, so you can slot that little PC at the back of your monitor.

The I/O is pretty complete, with 2 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, and HDMI 2.0 port, a displayport, and 2.5Gig ethernet port, and the power input at the back, plus that little kensignton lock if you want to tether that PC to your desk.

In the front, you get the power button, a headphone jack, a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, in blue, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port in yellow, and a USB C port that can also serve to power the device.

Whatever the model you want, you'll get the same APU: it's a Ryzen 5 3550H, with radeon Vega 8 graphics.

This little CPU isn't the most modern there is, but it's still quite capable, with 4 cores and 8 threads. It gets 967 in single core score in geekbench 5, and 3348 in multi core.

Idle temperatures are around 43 degrees Celsius, with an external temperature of the room of about 30 degrees. When running steam and installing games, a relatively intensive operation with a lot of reading and writing, temperatures maintained at around 55 to 60 degrees. And when gaming, and in intensive tasks, temperatures climbed to about 70 degrees, at which point the fan started running.

Now, for gaming, that thing won't let you play AAA titles at the highest quality, of course. It's more going to be indie titles, or 720p low, but it can still game.

All while I was playing, the fan started spinning up, but the noise really isn't too bad, which is important for a small PC like that that's going to be sitting on your desk close to you, or mounted behind your monitor.

Of course, it's more meant as an office desktop computer, or even a server, and in that case, it's going to do very well. The CPU is more than enough to carry you through office work, web browsing, viewing movies or videos online, or even some light creation, like using Krita, GIMP, or even Kdenlive. It could also make for a good set top box for your TV, using Plasma Bigscreen or a media center distro, or an emulation retro console with a bit more oomph than a raspberry pi, even up to Gamecube or PS2 titles.

Now, of course, this mini PC runs Linux. You can buy it with Windows from MinisForum, but it also exists with Manjaro, which is why we're reviewing it here, of course.
