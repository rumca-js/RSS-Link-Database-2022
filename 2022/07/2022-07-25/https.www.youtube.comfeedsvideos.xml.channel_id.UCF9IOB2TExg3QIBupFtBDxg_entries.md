Serious hepatitis outbreak in children, immunity was NOT generated as normal in locked down children and now the specific viral cause has just been discovered

https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/hepatitis/acutehepatitisofunknownaetiology/casedefinition/

Since 20th March

Children under 16 

35 countries

UK, 12 liver transplants, Ireland 2

Immunosuppressant drugs for life

No single virus had been identified in all cases

https://www.hpsc.ie/news/acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children.html

Hepatitis viruses A, B, C, E not detected in cases

No link to current covid infection status

Most / many cases were not covid vaccinated

Symptoms of hepatitis

Any one of the classic 3

Pale, grey-coloured stools

Dark urine

Jaundice

Other symptoms include

muscle and joint pain

fever 

feeling and being sick

feeling unusually tired all the time

a general sense of feeling unwell

loss of appetite

tummy pain

itchy skin

A post lockdown phenomena?

Two common viruses, spreading again after pandemic lockdowns

infants exposed later than normal

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.22277425v1

Detailed investigation, 9 early cases and 58 control subjects

Median 3.9 years, 4 boys, 5 girls

Preceding subacute history

Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, 

between 1 to 11 weeks prior to acute hepatitis

Using sequencing and real-time PCR

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 9/9

and liver of 4/4 patients

(normally causes no illness, requires a coinfecting "helper" virus)

Age-matched healthy controls

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/13

Children with adenovirus (HAdV) infection and normal liver function

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/12

Children admitted to hospital with hepatitis of other aetiology

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/33

AAV2 typically requires a coinfecting ‘helper’ virus to replicate

Usually adenovirus (HAdV) or a herpesvirus

Adenovirus (HAdV)

Detected in 6/9 cases

Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B)

Detected in 3/9 cases

Conclusion

Acute non-A-E paediatric hepatitis is associated with the presence of Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) infection,

which could represent a primary pathogen or a useful biomarker of recent Adenovirus (HAdV) or Herpesvirus (HHV6B) infection. 

Prof Judith Breuer, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital

During the lockdown period when children were not mixing, they were not transmitting viruses to each other. 

They were not building up immunity to the common infections they would normally encounter. 

When the restrictions were lifted, children began to mix, viruses began to circulate freely - and they suddenly were exposed with this lack of prior immunity to a whole battery of new infections.

Prof Emma Thomson, University of Glasgow

Larger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.

We also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored,

it may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, 

leading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children


Class II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele

Identified in 8/9 cases (89%)

(background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors)

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) mutations

May be significant

9 capsid gene mutations over-represented in these cases

altered phenotype, including substantial evasion of neutralising antibodies directed against wild-type AAV2,

enhanced production yields, 

increased virion stability.

Millions of routine vaccinations missed because of covid disruptions.

COVID-19 pandemic and global childhood vaccinations

COVID-19 pandemic fuels largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades

Global vaccination coverage continued to decline in 2021, 

Data WHO and UNICEF

Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTP3)

5% down between 2019 and 2021

25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP in 2021

18 million, zero doses

India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Philippines, Myanmar, Mozambique

devastating but preventable diseases

Factors

Children living in conflict and fragile settings

Increased misinformation

COVID-19 related issues

Service and supply chain disruptions

Resource diversion

Containment measures, limited service access

Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director

This is a red alert for child health. 

We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. 

The consequences will be measured in lives

We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, 

more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine

Global coverage of first dose of HPV vaccine, 15%

A backdrop of rapidly rising rates of severe acute malnutrition

Weakened immunity and missed vaccinations

a child survival crisis 

First dose measles coverage

Dropped to 81% in 2021

24.7 million children missed first measles dose

5.3 million more than in 2019

https://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2022-unicef-and-who-warn-of--perfect-storm--of-conditions-for-measles-outbreaks--affecting-children

January and February 2022

17,338 measles cases

January and February 2021

 9,665 measles cases

2018

140,000 measles deaths

mostly among children under the age of five
