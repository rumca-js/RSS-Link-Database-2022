LYRICS
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
But you know that they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
And in the paper today, tales of war and of rage
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
But you know that they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of the drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
But you know that they won't win

Now you know that they won’t win
Oh you know that they won’t win
