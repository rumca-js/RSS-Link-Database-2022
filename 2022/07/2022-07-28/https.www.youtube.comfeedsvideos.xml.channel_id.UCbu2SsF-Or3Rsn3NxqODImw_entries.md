PlayStation Plus has recently changed, going from one plan to three, with each plan offering various benefits including cloud saves, game trials, and, crucially, a bunch of games to download and play. If you have PlayStation Plus Premium, you’ve got hundreds of games at your fingertips, and if you’re suffering from choice paralysis, then have no fear, each month we’ll round up the new additions and guide you on what to play first.

This month brings RGG’s renowned Yakuza series to PlayStation Plus. Yakuza: Like A Dragon is available for PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers, but if you have Game Catalog, then you’ll get access to all of Kazuma Kiryu’s saga. Also new this month is Marvel’s Avengers and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2. We also make recommendations on what to queue up from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog, because everyone’s got a backlog, right?

PlayStation Plus has three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium, and each tier offers different benefits. We have a complete rundown of what you can expect right here on GameSpot, and if you want new recommendations each month, make sure to subscribe. We also have a monthly Xbox Game Pass show where we discuss what’s joining and leaving the rotating catalog on Microsoft's services.

Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series has consistently been one of the most beloved and successful open world RPG's. And, while we eagerly wait for Elder Scrolls VI, here is a loving look back at Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is the story of Skyrim as told by its fans.

Join Adam Mason, Dave Jewitt, and Kurt Indovina of GameSpot, Cam Robinson, DaveControl, ESO Danny, Super BunnyHop, Lucy James of Giant Bomb, FudgeMuppet, Rycon Roleplays, and Shirley Curry as they discuss the impact Skyrim has had on them and the gaming industry as a whole in this love letter to Elder Scrolls V.

While Skyrim wasn't the Elder Scrolls game that established the series as an open-world RPG great, and many will argue over if Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim did it best, its tremendous success and impact can't be denied. The cold, northern region of Tamriel has become the home of many stories, and the epic sweeping soundtrack of Skyrim not only contains incredible tracks to relax to as you explore, but of course, Dovahkiin - the perfect ode to a Dragonborn.

Cam Robinson, Adam Mason, and Dave Jewitt discuss the meme of being a stealth archer in Skyrim, while Super BunnyHop, Rycon Roleplays, FudgeMuppet, and Shirley Curry discuss roleplaying in Skyrim. Lucy James and SuperBunnyHop chat about Skyrim Mods, while Kurt and Rycon Roleplays chat about how great the Dark Brotherhood quests are.

Enjoy the 2nd episode of I :heart: Gaming. If you missed it, check out our first episode on Dark Souls, featuring: Adam Mason, Brad Ellis of Easy Allies, Caddicarus, Chris Morris, Dave Jewitt, DaveControl, Gav Murphy and Rory Powers of RKG, Super BunnyHop, HeyZeusHeresToast, Iron Pineapple, Jessie Gender, LobosJR, Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain of Giant Bomb, Marz, Otzdarva, Prod, Quelaag, and Sinclair and Sophie of SinclairLore.

Could the PlayStation 5 be getting more expensive? Plus Steam Deck availability is improving, Genshin Impact teases its 3.0 update, and and the Analogue Pocket is getting some new features.
#Gaming #PS5 #PlayStation5 

Could a PlayStation 5 price hike actually happen? Plus, exciting Steam Deck news, a Genshin Impact 3.0 tease and new updates to the Analogue Pocket on today’s GameSpot News.

The PlayStation 5 is flying off store shelves, but--due to supply chain issues and other factors--the system has not been able to match the sales success of the PlayStation 4 thus far.

Sony's latest earnings briefing shows that the PS5’s lifetime has reached 21.7 million since launch in November 2020. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, reached 25.4 million units after its first seven quarters on the market.

During a call with investors, Sony was asked about a potential PS5 price increase, something the company has done in Japan with other products, including speakers, headphones, and cameras, due to various factors

According to VGC's translation of comments made CFO Hiroki Totoki, Sony isn't prepared to comment on the possibility of a PS5 price hike. "About a potential price increase for the PS5, at this point in time there is nothing specific I can share with you about prices," the executive said.

While a price increase would be an unprecedented move for a console, we did just see this happen with the Meta Quest 2, which it itself is getting a $100 price hike in August.

If you’ve been struggling to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, and have been eyeing a Steam Deck, some great news from Valve! The company put out a statement that it will be able to meet demand sooner than estimated, and that anyone with a current reservation will be receiving their handheld by the end of the year.

PS5 will be getting it's potentially best update so far, Backbone is making another controller, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is getting more courses, and Xbox Games with Gold for August have been announced.
#Gaming #PlayStation5 #PS5 

Ask and you shall receive! Folders are coming to the PlayStation 5. Plus, Sony is partnering with Backbone for a new mobile controller, and more, on today’s GameSpot News.

After GameSpot dot com’s op-ed on the PlayStation 5 needing folders, especially now thanks to the new PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium services, mere days later, Sony announced the next beta update for the system will implement just that. Coincidence? I think not!

While it’s awesome that this feature is coming to the PS5, there is a catch! Rather than existing in the home screen’s row of games, what Sony is dubbing as “game lists” will reside within the system’s Game Library found at the end of the row, although as this is currently in beta, there’s a chance this could change for the system update’s wide release.

Each game list can contain up to 100 titles, and up to 15 game lists can be created. Game lists can contain disk, digital, or cloud based titles, and a game can be included in more than one game list.

Additional beta features that begin rolling out today to select users are 1440p support, in case you’re playing on a computer monitor of that resolution, you will no longer be locked to the lower res 1080p experience, as well as the ability to compare the system’s 3D audio to a regular stereo setup. Head to the GameSpot link in the description for the full details, and keep an eye out for an email from Sony in case you are selected for this beta test.

Sticking with PlayStation news, the popular mobile Backbone controller is getting a PS5 makeover. While the device isn’t getting DualSense features such as haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it is getting a matching white overhaul, as well as translucent buttons and d-pad, meaning if you’re using the device for PlayStation Remote Play, you’ll actually have face buttons that match the on-screen input prompts.

The device is available starting today, for the same price as the normal Backbone, however, it does not include 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate for new subscribers that the regular controller does. According to Backbone’s website, the PlayStation Edition will still include 3 months of Discord Nitro, a month of Apple Arcade, and 2 months of Stadia Pro, all for new subscribers.
