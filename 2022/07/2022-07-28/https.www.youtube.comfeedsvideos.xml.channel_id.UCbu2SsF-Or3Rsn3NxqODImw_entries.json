And, while we eagerly wait for Elder Scrolls VI, here is a loving look back at Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is the story of Skyrim as told by its fans.\n\nJoin Adam Mason, Dave Jewitt, and Kurt Indovina of GameSpot, Cam Robinson, DaveControl, ESO Danny, Super BunnyHop, Lucy James of Giant Bomb, FudgeMuppet, Rycon Roleplays, and Shirley Curry as they discuss the impact Skyrim has had on them and the gaming industry as a whole in this love letter to Elder Scrolls V.\n\nWhile Skyrim wasn't the Elder Scrolls game that established the series as an open-world RPG great, and many will argue over if Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim did it best, its tremendous success and impact can't be denied. The cold, northern region of Tamriel has become the home of many stories, and the epic sweeping soundtrack of Skyrim not only contains incredible tracks to relax to as you explore, but of course, Dovahkiin - the perfect ode to a Dragonborn.\n\nCam Robinson, Adam Mason, and Dave Jewitt discuss the meme of being a stealth archer in Skyrim, while Super BunnyHop, Rycon Roleplays, FudgeMuppet, and Shirley Curry discuss roleplaying in Skyrim.

Plus, exciting Steam Deck news, a Genshin Impact 3.0 tease and new updates to the Analogue Pocket on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 is flying off store shelves, but--due to supply chain issues and other factors--the system has not been able to match the sales success of the PlayStation 4 thus far.\n\nSony's latest earnings briefing shows that the PS5\u2019s lifetime has reached 21.7 million since launch in November 2020. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, reached 25.4 million units after its first seven quarters on the market.\n\nDuring a call with investors, Sony was asked about a potential PS5 price increase, something the company has done in Japan with other products, including speakers, headphones, and cameras, due to various factors\n\nAccording to VGC's translation of comments made CFO Hiroki Totoki, Sony isn't prepared to comment on the possibility of a PS5 price hike. \"About a potential price increase for the PS5, at this point in time there is nothing specific I can share with you about prices,\" the executive said.\n\nWhile a price increase would be an unprecedented move for a console, we did just see this happen with the Meta Quest 2, which it itself is getting a $100 price hike in August.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been struggling to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, and have been eyeing a Steam Deck, some great news from Valve! The company put out a statement that it will be able to meet demand sooner than estimated, and that anyone with a current reservation will be receiving their handheld by the end of the year.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:15 - Potential PS5 price increase\n01:24 - Steam Deck supply\n02:16 - Genshin Impact 3.0\n02:53 - Analogue Pocket OS v1.1 update", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUE-R6Z6aw", "date_published": "2022-07-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2022 Livestream", "description": "Tune in for reveals, announcements, and much more.

Folders are coming to the PlayStation 5. Plus, Sony is partnering with Backbone for a new mobile controller, and more, on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nAfter GameSpot dot com\u2019s op-ed on the PlayStation 5 needing folders, especially now thanks to the new PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium services, mere days later, Sony announced the next beta update for the system will implement just that. Coincidence? I think not!\n\nWhile it\u2019s awesome that this feature is coming to the PS5, there is a catch! Rather than existing in the home screen\u2019s row of games, what Sony is dubbing as \u201cgame lists\u201d will reside within the system\u2019s Game Library found at the end of the row, although as this is currently in beta, there\u2019s a chance this could change for the system update\u2019s wide release.\n\nEach game list can contain up to 100 titles, and up to 15 game lists can be created. Game lists can contain disk, digital, or cloud based titles, and a game can be included in more than one game list.\n\nAdditional beta features that begin rolling out today to select users are 1440p support, in case you\u2019re playing on a computer monitor of that resolution, you will no longer be locked to the lower res 1080p experience, as well as the ability to compare the system\u2019s 3D audio to a regular stereo setup. Head to the GameSpot link in the description for the full details, and keep an eye out for an email from Sony in case you are selected for this beta test.\n\nSticking with PlayStation news, the popular mobile Backbone controller is getting a PS5 makeover. While the device isn\u2019t getting DualSense features such as haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it is getting a matching white overhaul, as well as translucent buttons and d-pad, meaning if you\u2019re using the device for PlayStation Remote Play, you\u2019ll actually have face buttons that match the on-screen input prompts.\n\nThe device is available starting today, for the same price as the normal Backbone, however, it does not include 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate for new subscribers that the regular controller does. According to Backbone\u2019s website, the PlayStation Edition will still include 3 months of Discord Nitro, a month of Apple Arcade, and 2 months of Stadia Pro, all for new subscribers.\n\nTIMECODES: \n00:12 - PS5 Update https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-beta-update-adds-1440p-support-game-lists-and-more-social-features/1100-6505950/\n01:20 - Backbone's new controller\n02:10 - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC\n02:58 - Xbox Games with Gold https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-with-gold-free-games-for-august-2022-revealed/1100-6505964/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2nhOxo7Ygg", "date_published": "2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
