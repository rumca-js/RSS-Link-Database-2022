During the third song, the audience were singing so wholeheartedly they could be heard belting out the lyrics to \u201cCare\u201d from backstage. None other than Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney made her way to the wings to snap a smartphone photo of the band in action. The set comprised tunes from Beabadoobee\u2019s 2020 album \"Fake It Flowers\" and this year\u2019s \"Beatopia,\" as well as from the intervening year\u2019s EP Our Extended Play and 2019\u2019s Space Cadet.\n\nBeabadoobee quieted things down for a bit when she gave a solo acoustic performance of \u201cCoffee\u201d before ramping up the energy again with the dynamics-hopping \u201cSorry.\u201d The next song, \u201cShe Plays Bass\u201d had the audience completely engrossed in singing and dancing (save for a bit of playful distraction from a supersize beachball making its way among the crowd). Beabadoobee seized a moment during \u201cShe Plays Bass\u201d to introduce bassist Eliana Sewell, as well as drummer Luca Caruso and lead guitarist Jacob Bugden. (Bugden\u2019s cool glasses and shock of bleach-blonde hair lent him a resemblance to Chris Collingwood of power-pop icons Fountains of Wayne.)\n\nA moment of drama ensued during Beababoodee\u2019s self-declared favorite song from Beatopia, \u201cSee You Soon,\u201d when Caruso\u2019s drum shield collapsed into his kit. After a scramble by the quickly responsive stage crew, the group closed out the set with a string of rockers given extra punch with the drum shield now gone, the audience hanging on to every last beat, lick and lyric. \n\nSongs Performed \n00:00 Worth It\n03:51 Together\n07:13 Care\n11:16 Talk\n14:10 He Gets Me So High\n17:01 Coffee\n19:04 Sorry\n22:43 She Plays Bass\n26:40 See You Soon\n30:50 Back to Mars\n32:55 Last Day on Earth\n36:49 Cologne\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.

Backed by insistent drums, growling bass and jangling rhythm guitar, Bombino launched into blues-tinged North African grooves, tracing pentatonic-scale shapes up and down the fretboard of his chiming electric guitar. Dressed in bubus, traditional Taureg attire, Bombino and his bandmates \u2014 Kawisan Mohammed (rhythm guitar), Youba Dia (bass) and Corey Wilhelm (drums) \u2014 soon got a sizeable number of the crowd dancing joyfully in front of the stage, matching the band\u2019s irresistible rhythms.\n\nInteraction with the audience was sparse, but the music did the talking. \u201cEnglish is very hard for us,\u201d admitted bass player Dia, alternately switching from English to French, the latter of which was met enthusiastically by a not insignificant francophone contingent in the audience.\n\nThe songs flowed seamlessly from one to the other, maintaining an upbeat spirit throughout the set. \u201cWith Bombino, there\u2019s never a setlist,\u201d Wilhelm explained afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s all feeling. Bombino sees what\u2019s working with the audience and calls the songs as we go.\u201d\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
