Developed by Nacon Milan, a young studio with only the title Rims Racing under its belt, this untitled Terminator game will be set before the events of Judgement Day when the war between humans and machines begins. The teaser image shows the T-800, the robot skeleton under Arnold Schwarzenneger\u2019s synthetic skin in the films, but no details so far on whether the iconic actor, or any characters from the films, will make an appearance.\n\nStarting in August, Quest users will no longer need to use their FB account to log in! Instead, users will need to create a new Meta account in order to use their headset.\n\nThis move is all a part of Meta's plan to continue shifting away from the Facebook brand as well as a response to user dissatisfaction with the Facebook account requirement.\u00a0\n\nNintendo has announced that the N64 game Pokemon Puzzle League is coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on July 15.\n\nTIME STAMPS: \n00:10 - The Terminator will be back in an open world survival game.\n01:06 - Meta Quest headsets will soon no longer need a Facebook login\n02:12 - Pokemon Puzzle League on Switch\n02:33 - Xbox Confirms Plans For Gamescom 2022\n03:21 - The Matrix Awakening will be delisted", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgw5J9JLqA0", "date_published": "2022-07-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
