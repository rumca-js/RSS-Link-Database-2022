Wade got aborted this past week, so the podcast gets hijacked by the women at The Babylon Bee. Men cannot talk about abortion, because of their lack of uteri, so Chandler, Bettina, Emma, and Claire take over to discuss the overturn of almost 50 years of baby murder precedent and how everyone lost their poop on Twitter. Kristan Hawkins from Students For Life of America calls in to tell us about Roe V. Wade being overturned and what that means for the future of the pro-life movement. Also, Pete Hegseth and David Goodwin talk to The Babylon Bee about how progressives hijacked public education and ruined basically everything. \n\nThis episode is brought to you by our awesome sponsor Alliance Defending Freedom.
