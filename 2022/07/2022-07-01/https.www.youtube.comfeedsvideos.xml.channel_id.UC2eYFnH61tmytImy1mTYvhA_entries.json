Not only has it made the site easier to maintain, but I've added some other perks like a simple Javascript list filter and I've enjoyed Hugo so much I switched by personal website (https://lukesmith.xyz) over to it as well.\n\nIf you want to contribute a recipe, or improve a preexisting one, including adding an image, you can do it at the Github repository for the site: https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/based.cooking\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nClassical books reprinted by me: https://lindypress.net\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\nBTC: bc1qw5w6pxsk3aj324tmqrhhpmpfprxcfxe6qhetuv\nXMR: 48jewbtxe4jU3MnzJFjTs3gVFWh2nRrAMWdUuUd7Ubo375LL4SjLTnMRKBrXburvEh38QSNLrJy3EateykVCypnm6gcT9bh\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXKSKb3etk", "date_published": "2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
