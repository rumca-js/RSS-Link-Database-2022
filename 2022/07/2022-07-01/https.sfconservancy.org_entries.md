Those who forget history often inadvertently repeat it. Some of us recall that twenty-one years ago, the most popular code hosting site, a fully Free and Open Source (FOSS)  site called SourceForge, proprietarized all their code — never to make it FOSS again.  Major FOSS projects slowly left  SourceForge since it was now, itself, a proprietary system, and antithetical to FOSS.  FOSS communities learned that it was a mistake to allow a for-profit, proprietary  software company to become the dominant FOSS collaborative development site.  SourceForge slowly collapsed after the DotCom crash,  and today, SourceForge is more advertising link-bait than it is code hosting. We learned a valuable lesson that was a bit too easy to forget — especially when corporate involvement manipulates   FOSS communities to its own ends.  We now must learn the SourceForge lesson again with Microsoft's GitHub.
