The GameSpot News of the day is a double dose of Mjolnir might. Plus, an upcoming test flight for Halo Infinite will give players a taste of campaign co-op.\n\nDetails of God of War Ragnarok\u2019s collector\u2019s editions have reportedly leaked. Amid a whirlwind of rumors around an upcoming announcement for the game\u2019s release date are details of what fans could expect the more pricey versions of it to include. According to the leaks, the tier above the standard release will be known as the J\u00f6tnar edition, referencing the giants of J\u00f6tunheim. This edition will include a 1:1 replica of the game\u2019s version of Mjolnir, which was briefly teased at the very end of God of War 2018. Considering Thor will be a major character in the upcoming sequel, the mighty weapon is likely to be prominently featured in the game. There will also reportedly be an even pricier collector\u2019s edition beyond that, including a map of the game world, badges, and potentially additional items.\n\nOf course, the biggest question on everyone\u2019s mind is when we can get our hands on the game. For those eager to know the answer, may I remind you that God of War 2018\u2019s release date was only announced a mere 3 months beforehand, giving the team at Sony Santa Monica plenty of time to make the reveal for Ragnarok, even if it is still coming out this Holiday.\n\nFrom one Mjolnir to another, Xbox is giving away another limited edition Series X, this time in celebration of the release of the upcoming Marvel film Thor Love and Thunder. The design is a match made in Asgard for the boxy console, which is wrapped in a skin to replicate the God of Thunder\u2019s trusty hammer Mjolnir. Featuring cracks along its faces to resemble its reforging after its destruction at the hands of Hela, Goddess of Death, in Thor Ragnarok, the promotional image of the Xbox also features the weapon\u2019s handle sticking out from the back side. If the handle is indeed a part of the final product, hopefully the winner is worthy of this godly gift so they can actually pick it to put on their TV stand.\n\nThe giveaway also features a custom Mjolnir Xbox controller, although there are no images of that at this time. To enter, Twitter users simply need to retweet the Xbox account\u2019s post with #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. \n\nFrom one Mjolnir to another, \n\nOf course, the biggest question on everyone\u2019s mind is when we can get our hands on the game.

Sorry, no local co-operative at the moment still. Players will need to sign up for the test flight, which will occur in a separate instance of the game from any progress you\u2019ve made thus far in the campaign, and any progress you make in the test flight cannot be brought over.\n\nOne of the main pain points according to the team on getting online campaign co-op up and running was the game becoming unstable when players strayed too far away from one another. In the test flight, teammates will only be able to stray 800 feet away from anyone else in the group before getting a warning to return. At 1000 feet, that player is respawned immediately back with their team. 343 industries\u2019 primary software engineer lead Isaac Bender assures players that that distance is enough for teams to attack the campaign\u2019s biggest Covenant bases from opposite sides with room to spare.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today\u2019s GameSpot News!

Let\u2019s talk about what made the game so special.\u00a0\n\nTime Code:\u00a0\n00:00 - 00:26\u00a0 Intro\n00:27 - 08:14\u00a0 Campaign\n08:15 - 13:00 Multiplayer\n13:02\u00a0 - 16:10 Warzone\n16:11 - 20:30 Modern Warfare 2\n20:21 - 21:26 Audience Questions\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 by Infinity Ward was a big departure from classic Call of Duty Games. It had a gritty campaign dealing with the impact of modern conflicts at home, introduced large open maps, added weight and heft to its gunplay, and mastered features like Gunsmith, where players built and saved detailed weapon blueprints. MW 2019 had a sandbox-style Ground War mode and also fast competitive modes like Gunfight. The first year of MW 2019 was extremely well planned as a live service game, with the free-to-play battle-royale Warzone launching and hosting memorable events such as The Haunting of Verdansk, a series of mysteries that led up to a rocket launch and even included zombies.\u00a0\nIn this video, David and Aaron talk about how MW 2019 was so different from classic Call of Duty games and why that matters. We\u2019ll dig into the campaign and how it put players into scary situations, in some cases with only a few enemies in a level, such as with the well-known Clean House (London) mission. We\u2019ll go over a few places where the campaign did cross the line. We\u2019re also talking about multiplayer and how Infinity Ward's maps are clever at all sizes, as well as the genius of the Warzone map being made up of core maps so that players were already familiar with it when it launched. We go over how the sandbox gave players a lot of tools and then set them free to try things such as using thermal scopes to see through smoke and using Javelin launchers to hit out-of-reach snipers. This game came out at the perfect time to appeal to lapsed Battlefield players and mil-sim fans, although it wasn\u2019t a great fit for all Call of Duty players. Fans of Sledgehammer and Treyarch\u2019s styles grew frustrated with a departure from the three-lane map design, ability to camp, and slower movement. Some fans rebelled when Modern Warfare's beta didn\u2019t include an always-on mini-map, causing Infinity Ward to put it back into the game.\u00a0\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28, 2022 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC. We got a hands-on preview of the game, so head on over to youtube.com/gamespot and watch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Preview - Bigger, Smaller, & Less Controversial.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTFG2nBda0", "date_published": "2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
