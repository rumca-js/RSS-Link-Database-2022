But this Tiny Desk performance \u2014 happily back in our NPR Music office \u2014 will help turn dark skies to blue and remind us of the best and brightest version of our country. \n \nThis video marks the world premiere performance of excerpts of Washington Women, uplifting songs built on speeches and writings by amazing women \u2014 First Ladies, Secretaries of State, Senators and Supreme Court Justices \u2014 who had strong visions of what America should be.\n \nThe project is the brainchild of intrepid choral conductor and composer Judith Clurman, who directs the meticulously fine-tuned Essential Voices USA, a New York-based choir. While the songs have their own musical personalities, they also contain iconic political personalities. Hillary Rodham Clinton states, \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights once and for all,\u201d while Shirley Chisholm, the first Black congresswoman, declares that laws can be used to compel \u201cthe insensitive majority to reexamine its unconscious attitudes.\u201d Betty Ford speaks of \u201cthe search for human freedom,\u201d and Vice President Kamala Harris talks about the importance of dreaming big.\n \nClurman says she wrote the piece (along with Broadway arranger David Chase) not just for professional choruses to sing. She hopes that high school choirs will pick it up as well so that young people across the country will know how influential these women were and are, in making America a brighter, better place. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cThe Essence of America\u201d (text by Condoleezza Rice)\n\u201cFor Centuries Now\u201d (text by Elena Kagan)\n\u201cFreedom\u201d (text by Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Betty Ford)\n\u201cIn the Field of Equal Rights\u201d (text by Shirley Chisholm)\n\u201cRemember the Ladies\u201d (text by Abigail Adams)\n\u201cWe Not Only Dream\u201d (text by Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi)\n\nMUSICIANS\nMusic by Judith Clurman and David Chase\nJudith Clurman: director\nEssential Voices USA Choir:\nPaul D\u2019Arcy\nChloe Holgate\nAmy Justman\nHelen Karloski\nEnrico Lagasca\nSteven Moore\nHeather Petrie\nJamet Pittman\nGregory Purnhagen\nElisa Singer Strom\nJason Weisinger\n\nTedd Firth: piano\nRaman Ramakrishnan: cello\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Tom Huizenga\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nSeries: Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, \nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\nSpecial Thanks: Yamaha Artist Services, New York, Jordan Kitt's Music\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #EssentialVoicesUSA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3XZg82Z52A", "date_published": "2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
