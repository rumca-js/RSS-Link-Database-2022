DNF Duel is an approachable, yet advanced fighting system that caters to all players.

With DNF Duel, Arc System Works ups the ante on this idea, taking an entire game--Nexon's long-running MMO Dungeon Fighter Online--and building a fresh new fighting game with it. The result is a solid brawler that, despite a mediocre story, boasts a varied roster, near-flawless online play, and a fighting system with plenty of options for new fighters and seasoned veterans alike. 

Arc System Works continues to set a high standard for fighting games with DNF Duel, creating an experience that's both simple enough for new players and robust enough for fighting veterans. 16 unique characters offer plenty of variety, the core fighting system rewards players who dig into it, and the online offerings feel like the arcade scenes of old. DNF Duel not only excels as a fighting game, but it also proves the versatility of the entire genre through its adaptation of an established IP into a whole new experience.

## God Of War Ragnarok Collector's Editions Leak | GameSpot News

The Collector's Editions for God of War Ragnarok leak, win a Thor Love and Thunder Xbox Series X, and sign up to test Halo Infinite's campaign co-op.

It’s hammer time! The GameSpot News of the day is a double dose of Mjolnir might. Plus, an upcoming test flight for Halo Infinite will give players a taste of campaign co-op.

Details of God of War Ragnarok’s collector’s editions have reportedly leaked. Amid a whirlwind of rumors around an upcoming announcement for the game’s release date are details of what fans could expect the more pricey versions of it to include. According to the leaks, the tier above the standard release will be known as the Jötnar edition, referencing the giants of Jötunheim. This edition will include a 1:1 replica of the game’s version of Mjolnir, which was briefly teased at the very end of God of War 2018. Considering Thor will be a major character in the upcoming sequel, the mighty weapon is likely to be prominently featured in the game. There will also reportedly be an even pricier collector’s edition beyond that, including a map of the game world, badges, and potentially additional items.

Of course, the biggest question on everyone’s mind is when we can get our hands on the game. For those eager to know the answer, may I remind you that God of War 2018’s release date was only announced a mere 3 months beforehand, giving the team at Sony Santa Monica plenty of time to make the reveal for Ragnarok, even if it is still coming out this Holiday.

From one Mjolnir to another, Xbox is giving away another limited edition Series X, this time in celebration of the release of the upcoming Marvel film Thor Love and Thunder. The design is a match made in Asgard for the boxy console, which is wrapped in a skin to replicate the God of Thunder’s trusty hammer Mjolnir. Featuring cracks along its faces to resemble its reforging after its destruction at the hands of Hela, Goddess of Death, in Thor Ragnarok, the promotional image of the Xbox also features the weapon’s handle sticking out from the back side. If the handle is indeed a part of the final product, hopefully the winner is worthy of this godly gift so they can actually pick it to put on their TV stand.

The giveaway also features a custom Mjolnir Xbox controller, although there are no images of that at this time. To enter, Twitter users simply need to retweet the Xbox account’s post with #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. 

From one Mjolnir to another, 

Of course, the biggest question on everyone’s mind is when we can get our hands on the game.

Strap into that Mjolnir armor, Spartan, because it’s time to test Halo Infinite’s online campaign co-op, along with mission replayability, something that was also missing from the game’s launch. Sorry, no local co-operative at the moment still. Players will need to sign up for the test flight, which will occur in a separate instance of the game from any progress you’ve made thus far in the campaign, and any progress you make in the test flight cannot be brought over.

One of the main pain points according to the team on getting online campaign co-op up and running was the game becoming unstable when players strayed too far away from one another. In the test flight, teammates will only be able to stray 800 feet away from anyone else in the group before getting a warning to return. At 1000 feet, that player is respawned immediately back with their team. 343 industries’ primary software engineer lead Isaac Bender assures players that that distance is enough for teams to attack the campaign’s biggest Covenant bases from opposite sides with room to spare.

That’s it for today’s GameSpot News! Thank you guys for joining me for my first week of videos. DeVante will be your host next week. Enjoy your long weekend, and he’ll see you guys on Tuesday right here at GameSpot.

## What Made Modern Warfare 2019 So Good

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 was something special, thanks to a gritty campaign, weighty gunplay, open maps, and Warzone. Let’s talk about what made the game so special. 

Time Code: 
00:00 - 00:26  Intro
00:27 - 08:14  Campaign
08:15 - 13:00 Multiplayer
13:02  - 16:10 Warzone
16:11 - 20:30 Modern Warfare 2
20:21 - 21:26 Audience Questions

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 by Infinity Ward was a big departure from classic Call of Duty Games. It had a gritty campaign dealing with the impact of modern conflicts at home, introduced large open maps, added weight and heft to its gunplay, and mastered features like Gunsmith, where players built and saved detailed weapon blueprints. MW 2019 had a sandbox-style Ground War mode and also fast competitive modes like Gunfight. The first year of MW 2019 was extremely well planned as a live service game, with the free-to-play battle-royale Warzone launching and hosting memorable events such as The Haunting of Verdansk, a series of mysteries that led up to a rocket launch and even included zombies. 
In this video, David and Aaron talk about how MW 2019 was so different from classic Call of Duty games and why that matters. We’ll dig into the campaign and how it put players into scary situations, in some cases with only a few enemies in a level, such as with the well-known Clean House (London) mission. We’ll go over a few places where the campaign did cross the line. We’re also talking about multiplayer and how Infinity Ward's maps are clever at all sizes, as well as the genius of the Warzone map being made up of core maps so that players were already familiar with it when it launched. We go over how the sandbox gave players a lot of tools and then set them free to try things such as using thermal scopes to see through smoke and using Javelin launchers to hit out-of-reach snipers. This game came out at the perfect time to appeal to lapsed Battlefield players and mil-sim fans, although it wasn’t a great fit for all Call of Duty players. Fans of Sledgehammer and Treyarch’s styles grew frustrated with a departure from the three-lane map design, ability to camp, and slower movement. Some fans rebelled when Modern Warfare's beta didn’t include an always-on mini-map, causing Infinity Ward to put it back into the game. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28, 2022 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC. We got a hands-on preview of the game, so head on over to youtube.com/gamespot and watch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Preview - Bigger, Smaller, & Less Controversial.
