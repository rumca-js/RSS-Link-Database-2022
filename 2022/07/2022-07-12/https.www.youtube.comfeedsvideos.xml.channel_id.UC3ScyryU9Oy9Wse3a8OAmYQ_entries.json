But is this loosely regulated, multi-billion dollar industry putting seniors at risk? (Aired 2013)\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Assisted living started in the 1980s as a reaction to nursing homes, which had become more oriented toward hospitalization, and as a way of offering seniors more choices and more independence in the way they live. But over the years, assisted living has evolved to house seniors who need specialized care, such as those with memory impairments. That means that people have more needs, require more attention \u2014 and, some senior advocates argue, more or better regulations to ensure that the residents are safe and getting the quality of care they need.\n\nExplore additional reporting on \"Life and Death in Assisted Living\" on our website: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/life-and-death-in-assisted-living/\n\n#Documentary #AssistedLiving \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.
