​​More and more elderly Americans will be faced with the decision as to whether to spend their later years in assisted living facilities, which have sprung up as an alternative to nursing homes. But is this loosely regulated, multi-billion dollar industry putting seniors at risk? (Aired 2013)

In this major 2013 investigation with ProPublica, FRONTLINE examines the operations of the nation’s largest assisted living company, raising questions about the drive for profits and fatal lapses in care. Assisted living started in the 1980s as a reaction to nursing homes, which had become more oriented toward hospitalization, and as a way of offering seniors more choices and more independence in the way they live. But over the years, assisted living has evolved to house seniors who need specialized care, such as those with memory impairments. That means that people have more needs, require more attention — and, some senior advocates argue, more or better regulations to ensure that the residents are safe and getting the quality of care they need.
