Hugo will allow you to create optimal website, but we shall overcome the "Hugo Hump" in this video. You gotta understand how templates and themes were before you get into the really impactful stuff.

I still do explain partials, shortcodes and other more scriptable things here, but the main goal is getting you to understand how a Hugo site is configured and arranged.
