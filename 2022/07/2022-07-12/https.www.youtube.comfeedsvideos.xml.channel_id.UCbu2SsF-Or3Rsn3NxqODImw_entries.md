Bayonetta 3 is out this year, more games are coming to the new PlayStation Plus, and Metal Gear Solid games may be returning to digital storefronts.
#Gaming #Bayonetta3 #MetalGearSolid 

Bayonetta fans, rejoice! The franchise’s third installment is coming very soon. Plus, more games are coming to PlayStation… Plus! All this and more on today’s GameSpot News.

Bayonetta 3 is releasing this year, on October 28th. This upcoming December would mark the 5th anniversary of its reveal at the 2017 Game Awards, that initial announcement happening nearly four years after the release of Bayonetta 2, so fans have been desperately awaiting this release.

In this third installment, Bayonetta will be teaming up with her fellow Umbra Witches to face a new threat, the Homunculi. The game will allow players to also take control of a new character, Viola, as well as giving Bayonetta new abilities such as Demon Masquerade, where the titular character powers up by fusing with an Infernal Demon.

But that’s not all! A collector’s edition of the game, called the Trinity Masquerade edition, will be available for diehard fans, including an art book and swappable game case sleeves that when put together form a triptych image.

In what might be the most amusing news to come out of this announcement is the game’s “Naive Angel Mode.” Bayonetta is well known outside of the games’ playbase to the wider community thanks majorly in part to its… risque nature. 

But fret not, all you prude gamers out there. The Naive Angel Mode, AKA the horny police, is here to help. With Naive Angel Mode turned on, many of the game’s scantily clad characters, includings Bayonetta herself, will be provided a few more scraps of cloth to cover up their most sensitive areas. Developer Platinum Games notes that this will hopefully make it easier playing the game in the living room "without creating an awkward atmosphere." 

If only we had Naive Angel Mode for all the sex scenes in movies while watching with your parents. Think of all the internal trauma that could have been avoided.

We got to check out a hands-off preview of The Division: Resurgence, a mobile stand-alone game canonically set in the world of Ubisoft's cover based loot shooter. The graphics maybe inferior, but the game has a lot to unpack as we break down what you can expect from the mobile game.

#gaming #ubisoft #TheDivision #TomClancy #DivisionResurgence #ios #mobile #mobilegaming 

GameSpot recently got a chance to see Ubisoft’s upcoming mobile game, The Division Resurgence, in action and speak with executive producer Fabrice Navrez about its development. Much like its console and PC counterpart, Resurgence is a third-person looter-shooter that takes place in New York following the release of the devastating Green Poison. The game can be played cooperatively, but also offers competitive Skirmish and Domination modes as well as a dedicated Dark Zone.

Resurgence is a canonical entry in The Division franchise taking place both during and after the events of the first game. The third-person shooting gameplay is familiar with players taking cover on dilapidated city streets and using various abilities to get an edge over the enemy. At the beginning of the game, you choose your specialization, or class, and over the course of the game, you unlock different specializations and can swap between them. For example, the Vanguard specialization can highlight enemies for your team to see and the Demolitionist can use seeker mines to take them down, among other explosive weapons. Six specializations will be available at launch, according to Navrez. In the gameplay showcased, we saw players throwing up cover to get into better shooting positions and dropping remote turrets to help against enemies. The Freeman are also well-equipped, and can use items like remote-controlled drones.

The Division Resurgence will be entering closed alpha soon on iOS and Android mobile devices.

## Everything to Know About Stray

Stray, the game that lets you finally live every gamer’s dream of being a kitty in a cyberpunk world, is nearly upon us. So to prepare you for the latest game from renowned publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer BlueTwelve Studios, here’s everything you need to know about Stray.

In terms of gameplay, Stray, like our feline friends in general, defies simple explanation; being a mashup of platforming, exploration, and puzzle solving. As well as a cat simulator, which we all know is the main reason we’re all going to play the game.

First and foremost, the game comes with a dedicated button that lets you meow. So don’t worry, the game has you covered there. You can even do it during cinematics, truly putting you into the mindset of a cat who doesn’t care for such arbitrary concerns like story and plot.

But, more importantly, while the game does contain platforming elements, most of the jumping and hopping around is triggered by button prompts rather than player control as you explore the city. The real focus is to have you explore the city, with the challenge coming from figuring out where to go, rather than how to navigate it. Initially, the game’s level start pretty straightforward and linear, but also contains more open-ended larger segments for your feline form to explore and uncover where you need to go.

Further, stray contains puzzle-elements, forcing you to try to figure out how to navigate through its world, such as pushing over plants as every cat does, or utilizing pulley systems to access new areas.

However, these exploration and navigation segments are not all lackadaisical. At certain points in the game, you’ll be put into a chase sequence, where you’ll have to make split second choices about where and when to jump, forcing you to time exactly when you need to take a path. At the same time, you won’t be able to engage in combat, so your only choice will be to escape. You’ll need to think quickly and make precise movement choices adding to the pressure. Is that adrenaline you’re feeling or just catnip talking.

The biggest revelation is a variant of the massive scale Ground War mode, which features 64 players duking it out on large maps with vehicular combat.
