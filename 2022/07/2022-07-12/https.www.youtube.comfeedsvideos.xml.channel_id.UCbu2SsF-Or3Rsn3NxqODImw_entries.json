Bayonetta is releasing on the Nintendo Switch on October 28, 2022!\n\nBayonetta makes her way through multiple locations in an all-new, over-the-top action game. The Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and Witch Time ability. This time, invading manmade bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta\u2019s crosshairs.\n\n#Bayonetta3 #NintendoSwitch #Bayonetta", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnLEKI6S0JA", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bayonetta 3 Finally Gets A Release Date | GameSpot News", "description": "Bayonetta 3 is out this year, more games are coming to the new PlayStation Plus, and Metal Gear Solid games may be returning to digital storefronts.\n#Gaming #Bayonetta3 #MetalGearSolid \n\nBayonetta fans, rejoice! The franchise\u2019s third installment is coming very soon. Plus, more games are coming to PlayStation\u2026 Plus! All this and more on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nBayonetta 3 is releasing this year, on October 28th. This upcoming December would mark the 5th anniversary of its reveal at the 2017 Game Awards, that initial announcement happening nearly four years after the release of Bayonetta 2, so fans have been desperately awaiting this release.\n\nIn this third installment, Bayonetta will be teaming up with her fellow Umbra Witches to face a new threat, the Homunculi. The game will allow players to also take control of a new character, Viola, as well as giving Bayonetta new abilities such as Demon Masquerade, where the titular character powers up by fusing with an Infernal Demon.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all! A collector\u2019s edition of the game, called the Trinity Masquerade edition, will be available for diehard fans, including an art book and swappable game case sleeves that when put together form a triptych image.\n\nIn what might be the most amusing news to come out of this announcement is the game\u2019s \u201cNaive Angel Mode.\u201d Bayonetta is well known outside of the games\u2019 playbase to the wider community thanks majorly in part to its\u2026 risque nature. \n\nBut fret not, all you prude gamers out there. The Naive Angel Mode, AKA the horny police, is here to help. With Naive Angel Mode turned on, many of the game\u2019s scantily clad characters, includings Bayonetta herself, will be provided a few more scraps of cloth to cover up their most sensitive areas. Developer Platinum Games notes that this will hopefully make it easier playing the game in the living room \"without creating an awkward atmosphere.\" \n\nIf only we had Naive Angel Mode for all the sex scenes in movies while watching with your parents. Think of all the internal trauma that could have been avoided.\n\nTIME CARDS: \n00:14 - Bayonetta 3\n01:57 - PlayStation Plus games\n02:30 - Metal Gear Solid returning games", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvDaBgiAk0", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Division Resurgence - How Well Does It Work On Mobile?", "description": "We got to check out a hands-off preview of The Division: Resurgence, a mobile stand-alone game canonically set in the world of Ubisoft's cover based loot shooter. The graphics maybe inferior, but the game has a lot to unpack as we break down what you can expect from the mobile game.\n\n#gaming #ubisoft #TheDivision #TomClancy #DivisionResurgence #ios #mobile #mobilegaming \n\nGameSpot recently got a chance to see Ubisoft\u2019s upcoming mobile game, The Division Resurgence, in action and speak with executive producer Fabrice Navrez about its development. Much like its console and PC counterpart, Resurgence is a third-person looter-shooter that takes place in New York following the release of the devastating Green Poison. The game can be played cooperatively, but also offers competitive Skirmish and Domination modes as well as a dedicated Dark Zone.\n\nResurgence is a canonical entry in The Division franchise taking place both during and after the events of the first game. The third-person shooting gameplay is familiar with players taking cover on dilapidated city streets and using various abilities to get an edge over the enemy. At the beginning of the game, you choose your specialization, or class, and over the course of the game, you unlock different specializations and can swap between them. For example, the Vanguard specialization can highlight enemies for your team to see and the Demolitionist can use seeker mines to take them down, among other explosive weapons. Six specializations will be available at launch, according to Navrez. In the gameplay showcased, we saw players throwing up cover to get into better shooting positions and dropping remote turrets to help against enemies. The Freeman are also well-equipped, and can use items like remote-controlled drones.\n\nThe Division Resurgence will be entering closed alpha soon on iOS and Android mobile devices.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V23KS3kUao", "date_published": "2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Everything to Know About Stray", "description": "Stray, the game that lets you finally live every gamer\u2019s dream of being a kitty in a cyberpunk world, is nearly upon us. So to prepare you for the latest game from renowned publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer BlueTwelve Studios, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Stray.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Stray, like our feline friends in general, defies simple explanation; being a mashup of platforming, exploration, and puzzle solving. As well as a cat simulator, which we all know is the main reason we\u2019re all going to play the game.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game comes with a dedicated button that lets you meow. So don\u2019t worry, the game has you covered there. You can even do it during cinematics, truly putting you into the mindset of a cat who doesn\u2019t care for such arbitrary concerns like story and plot.\n\nBut, more importantly, while the game does contain platforming elements, most of the jumping and hopping around is triggered by button prompts rather than player control as you explore the city. The real focus is to have you explore the city, with the challenge coming from figuring out where to go, rather than how to navigate it. Initially, the game\u2019s level start pretty straightforward and linear, but also contains more open-ended larger segments for your feline form to explore and uncover where you need to go.\n\nFurther, stray contains puzzle-elements, forcing you to try to figure out how to navigate through its world, such as pushing over plants as every cat does, or utilizing pulley systems to access new areas.\n\nHowever, these exploration and navigation segments are not all lackadaisical. At certain points in the game, you\u2019ll be put into a chase sequence, where you\u2019ll have to make split second choices about where and when to jump, forcing you to time exactly when you need to take a path. At the same time, you won\u2019t be able to engage in combat, so your only choice will be to escape. You\u2019ll need to think quickly and make precise movement choices adding to the pressure. Is that adrenaline you\u2019re feeling or just catnip talking.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:19 - Plot & Setting\n0:45 - Gameplay\n3:34 - Platforms\n4:05 - Release Date & Price\n4:54 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpT_NRGCdn0", "date_published": "2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mass Effect And More Games Free For Prime Day | GameSpot News", "description": "A ton of games are free for Prime Day, more Call of Duty leaks, and a new Kirby game is announced.\n#Gaming #CallofDuty #primeday \n\nLooking for something to play this summer?
