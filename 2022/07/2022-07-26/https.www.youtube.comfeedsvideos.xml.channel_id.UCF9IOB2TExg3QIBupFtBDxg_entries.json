the presence of Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) infection,\n\nwhich could represent a primary pathogen or a useful biomarker of recent Adenovirus (HAdV) or Herpesvirus (HHV6B) infection. \n\nProf Judith Breuer, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital\n\nDuring the lockdown period when children were not mixing, they were not transmitting viruses to each other. \n\nThey were not building up immunity to the common infections they would normally encounter. \n\nWhen the restrictions were lifted, children began to mix, viruses began to circulate freely - and they suddenly were exposed with this lack of prior immunity to a whole battery of new infections.\n\nProf Emma Thomson, University of Glasgow\n\nLarger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.\n\nWe also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored,\n\nit may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, \n\nleading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children\n\n\nClass II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele\n\nIdentified in 8/9 cases (89%)\n\n(background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors)\n\nAdeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) mutations\n\nMay be significant\n\n9 capsid gene mutations over-represented in these cases\n\naltered phenotype, including substantial evasion of neutralising antibodies directed against wild-type AAV2,\n\nenhanced production yields, \n\nincreased virion stability.", "link":
