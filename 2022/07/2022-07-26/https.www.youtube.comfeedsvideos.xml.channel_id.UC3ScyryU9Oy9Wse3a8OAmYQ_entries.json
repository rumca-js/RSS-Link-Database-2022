The documentary examines how federal pandemic housing protections\u2014including a temporary ban on evictions and a massive rent relief program\u2014played out in the experiences of people living through this precarious time, and how parents like Hatcher (who eventually received federal rent relief that helped her secure housing) tried to maintain stability for their children in the meantime.\n\n\u201cShe knew something wasn't right. She was expecting something was going to happen,\u201d Hatcher said of her daughter. \u201cBut one thing she knows is, Mommy is always there; Mommy is still here. So it must be OK. You know, even though she knows her stuff is not at home. Even though she knows we're not going back there, she doesn't know we don't have a home because to her\u2014 Sorry.\u201d\n\nHatcher teared up. \n\n\u201cTo her, wherever I am is her home.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacing Eviction\u201d will premiere in full on Tuesday, July 26, 2022, at 10/9c on PBS stations (check local listings).
