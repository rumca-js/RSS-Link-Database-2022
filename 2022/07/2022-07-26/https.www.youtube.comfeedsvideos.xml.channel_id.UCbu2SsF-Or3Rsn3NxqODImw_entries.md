Bloomberg gets a big scoop on important Grand Theft Auto VI details, PlayStation Plus' August games are revealed, and Knight of the Old Republic Remake indefinitely delayed.
#Gaming #GrandTheftAuto6 #GTA6 

A report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier gives us the biggest info dump for Grand Theft Auto VI that we’ve ever gotten, both for details on what to expect in the game, as well as behind-the-scenes at Rockster on its development. Firstly, let’s talk about the contents of the game itself.

Bloomberg reports that the game will feature a Latina character, making this the first playable woman in a GTA campaign. This character will be a part of a pair of leads that are meant to be influenced by Bonnie and Clyde, the real life couple that went on a bank robbing spree with their gang during the Great Depression. No word on whether players will get to play as the other character in pairing.

The game has an internal codename, Project Americas, as it was initially meant to feature large swaths of the American continent. However, the scale of the game has been reduced over time, and will be set in the universe’s fictional depiction of Miami; Vice City. The report includes the details that the game will still be quite large, with more interior locations than previous GTA games, and that the developer will be adding additional cities and content over time.

But when can you play it? Some developers on the team told Bloomberg that it will be released sometime in publisher Take-Two’s fiscal 2024, which runs from April 2023 to March 2024. Although some interviewed believed that the game would not hit that window, and would release no sooner than 2024.

The game has been in development since 2014, which if it were to come out in 2024, would mean that development will take ten years, a time period in which Rockstar has gone through some dramatic changes. In 2018, hundreds of Rockstar employees spoke about about issues with crunch and toxicity at the developer, which has reportedly led to some massive cultural shifts at the company.

Employees informed Schreier that morale at Rockstar is at an all time high, thanks to changes in scheduling, converting contractors to full-time employees and the severance of several managers that workers underneath them deemed to be abusive and difficult to work with. This change in culture has guided the content of the game itself, aiming to not “punch down” on marginalized groups, and while previous entries have largely been a satirical look at the United States, several employees pointed out in the report that satirizing today’s United States is more difficult thanks to the US already being a parody of itself.

So if you’re disappointed in having to wait for GTA VI, don’t worry — we’re already living it.

## 8 Ways Disney Dreamlight Valley Is Different From Animal Crossing

In many ways, Disney Dreamlight Valley looks to Nintendo's Animal Crossing for guidance. Dig below the surface and you'll find Dreamlight Valley does many things in its own way.
#Gaming #DisneyDreamlightValley #AnimalCrossing 

Players who want to get in the game during its early access period can buy the Founder's Pack, with more details on that to come at a later date.

If you haven't heard by now, the farm-life sim genre that gave us classics such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley is getting a new entry soon. Disney Dreamlight Valley is, in large part, exactly what it sounds like: a House of Mouse spin on the popular genre where characters such as Isabelle and Tom Nook are replaced by Princess Jasmine and Scrooge McDuck. 

In many ways, Disney Dreamlight Valley looks to Nintendo's dominant life sim for guidance, which means the two games play a lot alike in some regards. For example, both drop you into the world as a newcomer inheriting a fixer-upper of a home in a town full of friendly faces eager for a meet-and-greet. Both also let you live out your days on your own schedule with activities like fishing, mining, shopping, cooking, and more.

## Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels Review

Hot Wheels returns to Forza Horizon with more track types and an even larger map to speed through, but its strict progression is an unwelcome speed bump. 

The Forza Horizon series has already crossed over with numerous franchises, from the building blocks of Lego to the family in Fast and The Furious, but it's the one with Hot Wheels and Forza Horizon 3 that sticks out the most when looking back. The combination of Horizon's blisteringly fast cars and the creativity of Hot Wheels twisty tracks was an unsurprising hit, making its return in Forza Horizon 5 an anticipated one. It's an expansion that manages to deliver the same thrill as before, with new track types and a much larger map, but also a structure to progression hampers the pacing.

#Gaming #CallOfDuty #ModernWarfareII 

with no money down via Verizon, and more PSVR 2 details, on today’s GameSpot News.

On Sunday, August 7, the Call of Duty League will be giving away beta codes for Modern Warfare II to lucky attendees of that day’s championship matches, either in person at the Galen Center in Los Angeles or viewing online via livestream.

If you’re watching online, you'll need to stream at least 60 minutes of the broadcast, at which point you'll be entered into a random prize draw for one of the early beta access codes.

Other methods for gaining early access to the beta include the usual preorder model, with Activision confirming that PlayStation owners will be able to play the beta five days earlier than any other platform. No official details on when the beta begins, but insiders have unofficially stated that mid-September is the targeted date, with the full game dropping on October 28.

Until then, you can check out the Mercenaries of Fortune update for Warzone starting tomorrow, July 27. The Model T-800 and T-1000 Terminators will be available via operator bundles, zombies are coming to rebirth island, and more. On the mobile side of Call of Duty, a Ghost in the Shell crossover will be coming to the phone and tablet based shooter on August 3. The anime collab will feature operator skins, a themed event, and a new battle royale location inspired by the show.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Review

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is another heartfelt adventure paired with some of the best combat in the series.

The premise of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bit unusual, but it sets the stage for a 100-hour epic through a fascinating world with strong characters and rewarding combat. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 may stumble from time to time, particularly in its dialogue, but its ambitious premise pays off with a heartfelt conclusion.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is, oddly enough, the fourth game in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, all of which are loosely tied to the long-running sci-fi fantasy ‘Xeno’ franchise. As Monolith Soft’s director, Tetsuya Takahashi, put it in an interview with Time in 2015: “The ‘Xeno’ name […] really just exists to make it clear that these are Tetsuya Takahashi productions.”

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 comes to Nintendo Switch on July 29, 2022.
