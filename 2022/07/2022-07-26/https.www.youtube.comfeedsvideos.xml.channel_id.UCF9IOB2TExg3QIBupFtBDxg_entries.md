Endemic in Africa

Cases now worldwide

METHODS

Formed an international collaborative group,

international case series, presentation, clinical course, outcomes of PCR confirmed infections

RESULTS
We report 528 infections diagnosed between 

April 27 to June 24, 2022

Cases, 528, at 43 sites in 16 countries

98% in gay or bisexual men, 7

5% were White, 

41% had HIV

median age 38

Transmission suspected to have occurred through sexual activity

95% of cases

Presentation in this series

95% rash 

(with 64% having less than 10 lesions)

73% anogenital lesions

41% had mucosal lesions

(with 54 having a single genital lesion)

Common systemic features preceding the rash

fever (62%)

lethargy (41%)

myalgia (31%)

headache (27%)

lymphadenopathy (56%)

Concomitant sexually transmitted infections

109 of 377 (29%)

Among the 23 people with a clear exposure history

median incubation period, 7 days (range, 3 to 20)

Monkeypox virus DNA

Detected in 29 of the 32 (in whom seminal fluid was analyzed)

Management

Antiviral treatment given to 5% of cases

70 (13%) were hospitalized

Mostly for pain management

severe anorectal pain (21)

soft-tissue superinfection (18)

pharyngitis limiting oral intake (5)

eye lesions (2)

acute kidney injury (2)

myocarditis (2)

infection-control purposes (13)

No deaths were reported

CONCLUSIONS

Monkeypox manifested with a variety of dermatologic and systemic clinical findings. 

Need for rapid identification and diagnosis of cases to contain further community spread.

Serious hepatitis outbreak in children, immunity was NOT generated as normal in locked down children and now the specific viral cause has just been discovered

https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/hepatitis/acutehepatitisofunknownaetiology/casedefinition/

Since 20th March

Children under 16 

35 countries

UK, 12 liver transplants, Ireland 2

Immunosuppressant drugs for life

No single virus had been identified in all cases

https://www.hpsc.ie/news/acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children.html

Hepatitis viruses A, B, C, E not detected in cases

No link to current covid infection status

Most / many cases were not covid vaccinated

Symptoms of hepatitis

Any one of the classic 3

Pale, grey-coloured stools

Dark urine

Jaundice

Other symptoms include

muscle and joint pain

fever 

feeling and being sick

feeling unusually tired all the time

a general sense of feeling unwell

loss of appetite

tummy pain

itchy skin

A post lockdown phenomena?

Two common viruses, spreading again after pandemic lockdowns

infants exposed later than normal

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.22277425v1

Detailed investigation, 9 early cases and 58 control subjects

Median 3.9 years, 4 boys, 5 girls

Preceding subacute history

Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, 

between 1 to 11 weeks prior to acute hepatitis

Using sequencing and real-time PCR

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 9/9

and liver of 4/4 patients

(normally causes no illness, requires a coinfecting "helper" virus)

Age-matched healthy controls

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/13

Children with adenovirus (HAdV) infection and normal liver function

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/12

Children admitted to hospital with hepatitis of other aetiology

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), 

detected in the plasma of 0/33

AAV2 typically requires a coinfecting ‘helper’ virus to replicate

Usually adenovirus (HAdV) or a herpesvirus

Adenovirus (HAdV)

Detected in 6/9 cases

Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B)

Detected in 3/9 cases

Conclusion

Acute non-A-E paediatric hepatitis is associated with the presence of Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) infection,

which could represent a primary pathogen or a useful biomarker of recent Adenovirus (HAdV) or Herpesvirus (HHV6B) infection. 

Prof Judith Breuer, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital

During the lockdown period when children were not mixing, they were not transmitting viruses to each other. 

They were not building up immunity to the common infections they would normally encounter. 

When the restrictions were lifted, children began to mix, viruses began to circulate freely - and they suddenly were exposed with this lack of prior immunity to a whole battery of new infections.

Prof Emma Thomson, University of Glasgow

Larger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.

We also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored,

it may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, 

leading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children


Class II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele

Identified in 8/9 cases (89%)

(background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors)

Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) mutations

May be significant

9 capsid gene mutations over-represented in these cases

altered phenotype, including substantial evasion of neutralising antibodies directed against wild-type AAV2,

enhanced production yields, 

increased virion stability.
