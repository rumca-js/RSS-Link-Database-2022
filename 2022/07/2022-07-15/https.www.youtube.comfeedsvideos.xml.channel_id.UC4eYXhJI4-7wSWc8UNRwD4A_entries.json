It\u2019s the first tour for the Italian pianist and composer since the beginning of the pandemic, following the release of his 2022 album, Underwater. It\u2019s an album that captures how many have felt in the pandemic \u2014 feeling underwater, or trapped in another world. \n\nIt\u2019s that relatable feeling \u2014 like we\u2019re treading water trying to remain above the surface, powering through the adversity of the last two years \u2014 that makes Einaudi\u2019s music so emotional and reflective. The pulsating strings of the opening song to his Tiny Desk concert, the track \u201cExperience\u201d from his 2013 album In A Time Lapse, demand attention, captivating the audience. The fact that the song recently went viral due to a TikTok trend only proves how welcoming Einaudi\u2019s music is \u2014 and why he is the most-streamed classical pianist of all time.\n\nLudovico Einaudi\u2019s presence at the piano keeps you waiting for more. His fingers glide over the keys effortlessly, but he never seems rushed. As he plays, his eyes are closed. And in this concert, you can tell his music moves him as much as it does his audience.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cExperience\u201d\n\u201cFly\u201d\n\u201cFlora\u201d\n\u201cLow Mist\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nLudovico Einaudi: piano\nFederico Mecozzi: violin\nRedi Hasa: cello\nFrancesco Arcuri: percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Director: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Kara Frame\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #ludovicoeinaudi", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyZ9OM-neM", "date_published": "2022-07-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
