High body temperature

Altered mental state or behaviour

Skin, often hot, red and dry at first

Nausea and vomiting
Tachycardia

Get help and get them cooled

Factors

Prevent

Good hydration

Loose fitting, lightweight clothes

Prevent sunburn

Delay workouts

Rearrange work schedules

Parked cars

Take time to acclimatize

Science

Hypothalamus set point is normal,

but is overwhelmed

Failure of thermal homeostatic mechanisms

Unlike fever where set point is deliberately increased by cytokines

Enzymic function

Pro inflammatory cytokine release

Inflammation

Damage to vascular endothelium

Intravascular coagulation of blood

Thermal coagulation

Disruption of intestinal barriers

Heat exhaustion
