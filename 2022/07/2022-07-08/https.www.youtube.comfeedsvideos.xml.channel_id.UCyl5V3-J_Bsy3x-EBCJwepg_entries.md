Kyle, Adam, and Emma from The Babylon Bee talk about what’s in the news this week. Hide yo kids and hide yo wife because the bison are attacking everybody up in here! Also, adoption is creepy now, TikTok banned The Babylon Bee, and it was revealed that Joe Biden financed Hunter’s trysts with Russian-linked escorts. They also do a rundown of their top ten comedy shows of all time and for some reason Kyle really really likes The Big Bang Theory. Really. Then, Emma, even though she isn’t a biologist, claims to be able to tell Kyle and Adam what a woman is.
