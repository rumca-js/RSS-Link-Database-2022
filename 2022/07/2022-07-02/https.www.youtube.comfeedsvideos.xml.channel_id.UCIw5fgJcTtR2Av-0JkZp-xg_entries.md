Music-gear-nerdy stuff:
This jam is DAWless. The Novation Circuit Tracks is the brain and sequencer. The opening arp and the rhythmic arp is the Circuit's internal Synth 2. The bass is using internal Synth 1. The drums use Drum Tracks 1&3 (kick, hats). The 2 MIDI tracks are being used to control the Arturia Microfreak and the Roland JU-06. I mostly used mutes/unmutes to transition between sections of the song.

Recorded as stereo (Circuit) and multitracks (guitar loop and solo) into a Zoom H5 and mastered in Logic Pro X (some eq and reverb and compression).
