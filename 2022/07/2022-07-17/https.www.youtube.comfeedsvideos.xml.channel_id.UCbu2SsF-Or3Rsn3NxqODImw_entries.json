As Dusk Falls deftly explores themes of inherited hardship through the lens of two families who cross paths on one pivotal night. By way of incredible voice acting, a compelling and expertly written script, and a bounty of pause-worthy choices along the game's elaborate branching paths, it establishes itself as an instant classic in the narrative adventure genre.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DbNMJiNU7g", "date_published": "2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warframe Devs Reveal New Game & Duviri Paradox Gameplay", "description": "Warframe devs announce a brand new game, Xbox & Activision Blizzard\u2019s deal is getting closer to wrapping up and Xbox Game Pass gets new games for the remainder of July.\n\nWarframe developer Digital Extremes has announced a new game called Soulframe, a free-to-play action \"hybrid-MMORPG\" that is now in early development. Development on Warframe will continue as other members of the team switch to Soulframe. At TennoCon, Digital Extremes shared more footage of the open-world story expansion, The Duviri Paradox, and announced a new story expansion called Veilbreaker. It's still very early days for Soulframe, and there is no word yet on platforms or a release date.\n\nJuly 19, aka tomorrow, sees the arrival of three more games, beginning with the day-one new release As Dusk Falls for console, cloud, and PC. This is an interactive drama and the debut title from developer Interior Night, a team founded by Quantic Dream veterans. Also arriving on July 19 is Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, along with Ubisoft's Watch Dogs 2 for console, cloud, and PC. On July 21, Xbox Game Pass will add the racing game MotoGP 22 for console, cloud and PC and the RPG Torment: Tides of Numenera for console and PC.\n\nIn March, the FTC asked for more information from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to further review their acquisition deal. After the additional information is reviewed, the FTC will have 30 days to challenge the acquisition. If not, the deal can continue as planned.\n\nWe now know, thanks to VGC, that Microsoft has provided the FTC with the information it was looking for. However it's unclear if Activision Blizzard has yet provided the FTC with the proper information, if not, then the 30 days to challenge the acquisition will be put on hold until Activision Blizzard shares the requested information. Once the FTC closes the investigation, the deal will be one step closer to being finalized.\n\nSTAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - Soulframe & Warframe\n01:05 - Game Pass\n01:30 - Microsoft & Activision\n02:18 - Star Wars: Hunters", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE7yoRVSf7c", "date_published": "2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What Were They Thinking? Gimmicks First Person Games Tried That Didn't Work", "description": "First-person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, tactical games like the Ghost Recon series, and old-school games like Duck Hunt have all been part of one of the most wildly successful types of video games: the shooter. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been plenty of silly inventions, questionable technologies, and flat-out bad ideas along the way. Let\u2019s look back at hilarious ideas developers tried, from early virtual reality to PlayStation's rave glow stick, the Move Motion Controller, that never quite worked.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that first-person, third-person, and multiplayer shooters are some of the most popular categories of video games, but the road to developers making the perfect experience is littered with hilarious peripherals, gimmicks, technology too far ahead of its time to function well, and some laughably bad ideas. In this video, we\u2019re going to take a look at some of the most memorable failed attempts, like early virtual reality prototypes in malls inspired by movies such as The Lawnmower Man and books such as Snow Crash. We\u2019re exploring the unexpected negative impact of flatscreen TVs on light gun games and the slow death of toy gun peripherals. We\u2019re looking at how developers tried for years afterward to keep light gun games alive with silly-looking inventions like Killzone 3 using PlayStation Move Motion Controllers on the PlayStation 3. We\u2019re going to the logical endgame of motion control, when Kinect for Xbox 360 tried to make players completely imagine controllers altogether; RIP Kinect. We\u2019re diving into how tactical games like SOCOM for the PlayStation 2 brought in squad voice commands long before speech recognition technology was good enough to make it work, leading to frustrating squad kills. Then we\u2019ll have a look at some of the modern haptic inventions attempting to improve on the time-tested controller rumbler that keeps getting better and better, most recently with the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense Controller with adaptive triggers. That means exploring haptic vests and butt rumblers.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to experiment with some of these older technologies for yourself, many can still be found online or in vintage shops like the NES Zapper, PS2 GunCon, and Socom U.S. Navy Seals PS2 headset. A remade version of the early VR game Dactyl Nightmare can be found on Oculus VR devices. Kinect games for the Xbox 360 still work to this day, and I highly recommend them, just not the shooter ones.\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n0:24 - Dactyl Nightmare\n1:22 - Light Gun Games After CRT TVs\n2:56 - Kinect\n5:11 - SOCOM Voice Commands\n6:26 - Haptic Suits \n7:54 - Outro\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keyDD-Eqom0&t \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGzvCaw62Y\n\n#gaming #fps #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgQxMTYrM7Q", "date_published": "2022-07-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
