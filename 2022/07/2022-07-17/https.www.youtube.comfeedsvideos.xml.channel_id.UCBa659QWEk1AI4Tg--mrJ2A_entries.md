I feel like there are other YouTube channels that would take a different approach here. â–ª With thanks to Professor Brian Kalt: his original article is here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=691642 -- any inaccuracies that have slipped in are mine alone, and this is, obviously, not legal advice!

To save you doing the research, my location while recording this was approximately 44.14 N, 111.05 W. I got three mosquito bites in under thirty minutes, including one on my hand.

(And the credits for this one are very old-school, so I'm adding a slightly self-aggrandising note here: I did everything for this video! The camera, the editing, the sound mix, the graphics. It's good to know I can still do that occasionally!)
