Maylee introduces us to her avatar Maloo, and the songs presented here from Maylee Todd\u2019s debut album Maloo are sung from the avatar's perspective.\n\nWritten during the pandemic, the album is about mental health and filled with multiple science fiction stories, including one about a programmable planet depicted in the \u201cwindow\u2019\u201d above Maylee Todd\u2019s head. \n\nThe electronic sounds that help tell these sci-fi tales include Maylee\u2019s Tenori-on, a Yamaha instrument comprised of a panel of lights that, when touched, create patterns of sound. An iPhone pointing at Maylee\u2019s face captures her reactions and expressions, which are then reflected in her avatar. Her musical partner Kyvita (Kyle Tan) accompanies her, adding textures from his synthesizers. \n\nIn the song \u201cDream With You\u201d Maylee explains that as the avatar is living its life, it realizes, \u201cmy brain, it\u2019s doing things that I don\u2019t want it to do.\u201d  Maylee Todd explains that Maloo, \u201cwrote a song, a breakup song saying bye bye to certain aspects that aren\u2019t serving it anymore.\u201d\n\nBefore her final song \u201cAbsolute Time and Space,\u201d Maylee Todd makes a passionate plea: \u201cHold the ones you love dear to your heart, will ya! Cause time is passing by \u2014 we do not have absolute time and space \u2014 as it turns out \u2014 in these bodies.\u201d\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cInfinite Program\u201d\n\u201cGrab Your Guts\u201d\n\u201cNo Classification\u201d\n\u201cDream With You\u201d\n\u201cAbsolute Time and Space\u201d \n\nMUSICIANS\nMaylee Todd: vocals, synths, iPhone face tracking\nKyvita: bass, keys\nMaloo (avatar): performance\n\nCREDITS\nDirector and Editor: Mason Rothschild\nMix and Master: Jake Viator\nEngineer: Chris Dwyer\nProduction Designer and AD: Leo Johnson\nDP: Elisha Jakob Maltinski\nCam Op: Petra Wurzinger\nCam Op: Roderick Hale, Ron Vasquez\nArt Director: Allison Jensen\nSet Dresser: B Armstrong\nGrip: Josh Brantner\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #MayleeTodd #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7_RDHan3M", "date_published": "2022-07-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
