complex but it\u2019s something we do need to be aware of and actually try and understand.\n\nThere is despair from your livelihood disappearing up the swanny. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to lead to suicide, chronic stress can lead to all sorts of problems.\n\nDr Charles Levinson, DoctorCall\n\nThe reasons behind these horrific numbers are complicated and none of us fully understand them, so that is exactly why there should be an urgent and comprehensive Government inquiry.\n\nIf anything, the situation seems to be worsening. \n\nConsidering the relentless focus on one virus for more than two years, \n\nrequesting answers from Government on thousands and thousands of non-Covid excess deaths is entirely reasonable. \n\nUser guide to mortality

milder the second or third time round\n\nDanny Altmann, professor of immunology, Imperial College London\n\nOmicron is poorly immunogenic, which means that catching it offers little extra protection against catching it again\n\nProf Tim Spector\n\nThere are definitely a lot of people who got Covid at the start of the year who are getting it again,\n\nincluding some with BA.4/5 who had BA.1/2 just four months ago\n\nrare to be reinfected with within three months\n\nBA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 escape antibodies elicited by Omicron

sub-variants notably evade the neutralising antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination\n\nVaccine boosters based on the BA.1 virus \n\n(e.g. those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna)\n\nmay not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron variants\n\n\n\nDr. Onyema Ogbuagu, Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut\n\nMy personal bias is that while there may be some advantage to having an Omicron-specific vaccine,\n\nI think it will be of marginal benefit over staying current with the existing vaccines and boosters\n\nDespite immune evasion, the expectation can be that vaccines will still protect against serious disease\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned clinically is that it\u2019s most important to stay up-to-date with vaccines\n\nto maintain high levels of COVID-19 antibodies circulating in the blood\n\nKei Sato, University of Tokyo\n\nNew sub-variants may have evolved to refavour infection of lung cells\n \nRisk is potentially greater than that of original BA.2\n\nDr Stephen Griffin, University of Leeds\n\nIt looks as though these things are switching back to the more dangerous form of infection, so going lower down in the lung\n\nNeutralization Escape by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2206576\n\nSubvariants BA.1 and BA.2, substantial escape from neutralizing antibodies\n\nSubvariants BA.4 and BA.5 have identical sequences of spike protein\n\nComparison of neutralizing antibody titer WA1/2020 isolate with BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4 or BA.5\n\nIsolate USA-WA1/2020 from an oropharyngeal swab,\n\nreturned from China,\n\nwho and developed clinical disease,\n\nJanuary 2020 in Washington, USA\n\nIn 27 participants, all vaccinated and boosted with Pfizer,\n\nAnd 27 participants who had been infected with the BA.1 or BA.2 median 29 days earlier (range, 2 to 113 days)\n\nIn the vaccine cohort\n\nParticipants were excluded,\n\nif they had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection,\n\nor a positive result on nucleocapsid serologic analysis,\n\nor if they had received another covid vaccine,\n\nor an immunosuppressive medication\n\nSix months after the initial two BNT162b2 immunizations\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer against WA1/2020 = 124\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer against omicron subvarients = 20\n\nTwo weeks after administration of the booster dose\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer against WA1/2020 = 5,783\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer against BA.1 = 900\n\nBA.2 = 892\n\nBA.2.12.1 = 410\n\nBA.4 or BA.5 = 275 (21 times lower than 5,783)\n\nWhat about natural immunity\n\nAmong the participants who had been infected with BA.1 or BA.2, \n\n26 had been vaccinated\n\nMedian neutralizing antibody titer\n\nWA1/2020 isolate = 11,050 \n\nBA.1 = 1,740\n\nBA.2 = 1,910\n\nBA.2.12.1 = 1,150\n\nBA.4 or BA.5 = 590 (18.7 times less than 11,050)\n\nThese data show that the BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 subvariants substantially escape neutralizing antibodies induced by both vaccination and infection. \n\nSARS-CoV-2 omicron variant has continued to evolve with increasing neutralization escape. \n\nThese findings provide immunologic context for the current surges caused by the BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 subvariants,\n\nin populations with high frequencies of vaccination and BA.1 or BA.2 infection.", "link":
