LYRICS
In the darkness
I will open up
Your mouth
And have a look inside
Cause you’ve got soft teeth
But they sink into me
Get out
Don’t just laugh in my face

If I can’t make you leave
I guess I’ll have to love you
If I can’t make you leave

In a strange way
You have known me longer than
Any friend
But I was taught
To cut you out
To run you out
To cast you out
Not to figure out
How you got in
How did you get in

Cause I just can’t believe
No one ever loved you
I just can’t believe
You’re all bad

If I can’t make you leave
I guess I’ll have to love you
Cause I just can’t believe
No one ever loved you
I just can’t believe
You’re all bad
