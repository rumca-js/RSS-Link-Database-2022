When developer Modern Storytellers wanted to make its successful Skyrim mod The Forgotten City a full-fledged game, they planned for a two year reskin. What they didn't know is that the small decision would derail the game's development for years.

The Forgotten City is a murder mystery, stuck in a time loop, set in an intricately designed Roman City. It's so well realized, that if you didn't know, you might assume the game was built from the ground up to always be that way. In actuality, it started as a Skyrim mod set in an underground Dwarven city. 

The original mod was a huge success, amounting in millions of downloads and garnered several writing awards including Best Interactive Media from the Australian Writers' Guild. Designer/writer Nick Pearce enjoyed making the mod so much that he left his established career as a lawyer to pursue game development full-time and bring the mod to life as a full-fledged standalone game. 

What was intended as a two year endeavor to remake the game in a Roman setting turned into a cascading list of problems that would cause Nick Pearce and his development team, Modern Storytellers, to rewrite and rebuild the game from the ground up.

This is the story of how changing the setting broke The Forgotten City.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is the latest game in Monolith Soft and Tetsuya Takashi's anthology Xeno series releasing to the Nintendo Switch. Here is everything you need to know about Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
#Xenoblade #Xenoblades #Xenobladechronicles #Xenosaga Chronicles 3 

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set in the world of Aionios, which is notable for its 2 major nations of Keves and Agnus - who constantly war with one another. Characters from Keves and Agnus only have 10 year life spans dubbed "terms".

In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you control 6 primary characters, 3 from Keves, and 3 from Agnus, who become unlikely allies and friends, who will end up fighting together to discover the truth of the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. In order to fight, each character starts with a primary class with its own set of arts to use in fightings - however, can switch classes and arts in-between fighting to level up and learn all new master arts that can be equipped regardless of class.

Some of the classes available included Swordfighter, Zephyr, Medic Gunner, Tactician, Heavy Guard, Ogre, Guardian Commander, Incursor, and War Medic.

Importantly, each of the main characters has another character they'll be able to interlink with. This fuses the two characters you choose together into a mech-like form called an Ouroboros for a limited set amount time. These Ouroboros also have special arts, however not constrained by the same limits as the characters on their own.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 releases July 29, 2022, with additional content releasing later this year, and into next year through a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass for an additional cost.
