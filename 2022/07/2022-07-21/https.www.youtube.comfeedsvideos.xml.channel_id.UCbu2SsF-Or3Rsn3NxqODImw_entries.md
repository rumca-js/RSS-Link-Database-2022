While Dark Souls isn't the first game in FromSoftware's now massively successful Soulsborne series, it was one of the most influential, spawning an entire genre of games influenced by its mechanics dubbed Souls-likes.

New Assassin’s Creed details have leaked, plus Last of Us Part 1 and Nintendo Switch Sports are getting new features.
#GamingNews #AssassinsCreed #TLoU 

Kotaku reported on Project Red's existence, while Bloomberg's Jason Schreier said Project Red is part of AC Infinity as opposed to a separate game. Sources speaking to Kotaku said this game, whatever it may be, could be set in Asia. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb previously said it may be set in Japan. During an earnings report call, the company mentioned a delay for another "smaller, premium unannounced title." Reports now indicate the game in question is Assassin's Creed Rift, a new standalone AC game that was originally meant to be a DLC episode for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

Naughty Dog has revealed more details on how the game has been remade for PS5 and PC in a new deep-dive video. While the core gameplay is essentially the same, players can expect graphical upgrades, new features, and enhancements that make the game more accessible. Some of the new features outlined in a PS Blog post include a new permadeath mode, a speedrun mode, an updated photo mode, unlockable costumes for Joel and Ellie, and a model-viewer mode.

Nintendo has announced that it will be adding full motion control support for soccer in Switch Sports on July 26. The upcoming free update is scheduled to go live at 6PM PT / 9PM ET and will include a number of new features including the ability for players to use the motion of their legs to kick the soccer ball in-game when using the leg strap accessory. Players will also be able to use their hands by jogging in place to dash in-game. Nintendo explained that playing this way will translate users' in-game kicks to be more powerful.

GTA Online’s next free expansion is called Criminal Enterprises. In the expansion you will take on a new mission called Operation Paper Trail as an agent of the International Affairs Agency to see if the Duggan petrochemical family are deliberately manipulating the fuel market. Rockstar says fans should keep an eye out for a "comprehensive list" of "new gameplay and experience improvements" across all of GTA Online. The developer will share further details on the gameplay and balance changes for the Criminal Enterprises expansion on July 26 when the expansion arrives. As usual, this new update is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but not PS3 or Xbox 360.

In other news, Bandai Namco has confirmed Dragon Ball: The Breakers will release on October 14. The game pits seven "survivors"--non-powered human characters--against one player controlling iconic villains (or Raiders) from across the Dragon Ball universe. The seven must survive until the end of the match, using items and perks against the villain, who wins by eliminating all other players. 

A closed network test for Dragon Ball: The Breakers was also confirmed, which will take place on August 5-6 across four sessions. The times for those sessions is as follows: 

August 5

## Saints Row Hands-on Preview

The new Saints Row feels a lot like a game from a different era, but with a bunch of additions that make it more than just a nostalgic return to the past.

We played about four hours of Saints Row at a recent preview event, which encompassed the beginning of the game. As with the original Saints Row, the new game is all about creating your own criminal empire--but you have a long way to go before that happens. It's set in the new city of Santo Ileso, a fictional location in the United States' Southwest that mixes an urban center, suburbs, and desert locations, and carries the vibe of places such as Las Vegas or Albequrque, without being quite like either.
 
Though we know you're eventually going to become a crime kingpin, the game starts with your humble beginnings, when your character is living in a dingy apartment with three friends: mechanic and driving wiz Neenah, entrepreneurial expert Eli, and shirtless DJ and resident cook Kev. Everyone in the group is familiar with petty crime, and both Neenah and Kev are members of local gangs. Neenah's with Los Panteros, a gang that's focused on cars and weight-lifting, while Kev hangs around with the Idols, a band of techno-anarchists who believe in a decentralized future. You're a member of the third "gang" in town, and the only legitimate one: a private military corporation called Marshall Defense Industries.

So at the start of Saints Row, your goal is to climb the corporate ladder as a mercenary at Marshall, mostly focused on bringing home enough rent money to keep you and your friends from eviction. Trying to find a way to "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" and fight an economic system stacked against you is a pretty pervasive theme in Saints Row--at one point, Neenah mentions the driving force for her doing crimes is to earn money to pay off her student loans. Your character is already a talented killer full of bravado, so the opportunity to earn bonus pay for performing well incentivizes you to become a one-person maverick murder machine.
