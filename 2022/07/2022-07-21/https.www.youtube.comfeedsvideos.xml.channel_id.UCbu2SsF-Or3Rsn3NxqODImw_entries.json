Sources speaking to Kotaku said this game, whatever it may be, could be set in Asia. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb previously said it may be set in Japan. During an earnings report call, the company mentioned a delay for another \"smaller, premium unannounced title.\" Reports now indicate the game in question is Assassin's Creed Rift, a new standalone AC game that was originally meant to be a DLC episode for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\n\nNaughty Dog has revealed more details on how the game has been remade for PS5 and PC in a new deep-dive video. While the core gameplay is essentially the same, players can expect graphical upgrades, new features, and enhancements that make the game more accessible. Some of the new features outlined in a PS Blog post include a new permadeath mode, a speedrun mode, an updated photo mode, unlockable costumes for Joel and Ellie, and a model-viewer mode.\n\nNintendo has announced that it will be adding full motion control support for soccer in Switch Sports on July 26. The upcoming free update is scheduled to go live at 6PM PT / 9PM ET and will include a number of new features including the ability for players to use the motion of their legs to kick the soccer ball in-game when using the leg strap accessory. Players will also be able to use their hands by jogging in place to dash in-game. Nintendo explained that playing this way will translate users' in-game kicks to be more powerful.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Assassin\u2019s Creed\n01:43 - The Last of Us Part 1\n02:49 - Nintendo Switch Sports", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQkj4FSX5Y8", "date_published": "2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Last of Us Part I - Official Features and Gameplay Overview Trailer", "description": "Take a look at some new gameplay for The Last Of Us Part 1 from the team at Naughty Dog.

As with the original Saints Row, the new game is all about creating your own criminal empire--but you have a long way to go before that happens. It's set in the new city of Santo Ileso, a fictional location in the United States' Southwest that mixes an urban center, suburbs, and desert locations, and carries the vibe of places such as Las Vegas or Albequrque, without being quite like either.\n \nThough we know you're eventually going to become a crime kingpin, the game starts with your humble beginnings, when your character is living in a dingy apartment with three friends: mechanic and driving wiz Neenah, entrepreneurial expert Eli, and shirtless DJ and resident cook Kev. Everyone in the group is familiar with petty crime, and both Neenah and Kev are members of local gangs. Neenah's with Los Panteros, a gang that's focused on cars and weight-lifting, while Kev hangs around with the Idols, a band of techno-anarchists who believe in a decentralized future. You're a member of the third \"gang\" in town, and the only legitimate one: a private military corporation called Marshall Defense Industries.\n\nSo at the start of Saints Row, your goal is to climb the corporate ladder as a mercenary at Marshall, mostly focused on bringing home enough rent money to keep you and your friends from eviction. Trying to find a way to \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" and fight an economic system stacked against you is a pretty pervasive theme in Saints Row--at one point, Neenah mentions the driving force for her doing crimes is to earn money to pay off her student loans. Your character is already a talented killer full of bravado, so the opportunity to earn bonus pay for performing well incentivizes you to become a one-person maverick murder machine.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7e40_DjGoU", "date_published": "2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
