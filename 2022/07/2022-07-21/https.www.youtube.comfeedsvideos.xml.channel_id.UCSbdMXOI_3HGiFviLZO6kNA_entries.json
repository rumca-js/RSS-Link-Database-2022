Of course I added VRChat and RecRoom, both things you can live in forever- but there's about 17 other ones that are simply awesome. This video actually took LONGER than I expected because i was too busy playing them, SO! Go play some free VR Games, all you have to lose is time. \n\nA lot of these games are either free on SteamVR or are on Oculus App Lab- available for Quest 2, but some of them are straight up store games. All you have to do is search for them! No sideloading needed. \n\n\nMY OUTRO MUSIC:\nhttps://youtu.be/u6JwgNQDVfI\n\nMY LINKS:\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/2hCGM9BYez\nTwitch:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 FREE VR GAMES\n01:16 MUST HAVE SOCIAL VR GAMES\n03:49 The Free Games- Finally\n12:24 Did I miss any?\n\nLinks for all of the games:\nRec Room\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2173678582678296&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/471710/Rec_Room/\n\nVRChat\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/1856672347794301&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/\n\nGorilla Tag\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/4979055762136823&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1533390/Gorilla_Tag/\n\nBigscreen\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2497738113633933&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/457550/Bigscreen_Beta/\n\nBattle Talent\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/4410602018966965&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1331510/Battle_Talent/\n\nPavlov Shack\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3649611198468269&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nLiminal\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3158342884265828&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1453730/Liminal/\n\nGun Raiders\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3982869578392875&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nOpen Brush\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3600360710032222&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1634870/Open_Brush/\n\nGravity Sketch\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/1587090851394426&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/551370/Gravity_Sketch/\n\nMoon Rider\nhttps://moonrider.xyz/\n\nKizuna AI\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3857024597703276&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nHibow\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3687705861311054&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/737630/Hibow/\n\nAncient Dungeon\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/4897577166950223&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1125240/Ancient_Dungeon/\n\nMission ISS\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2094303753986147&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nGoliath: Playing With Reality\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3432432656819712&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nEcho VR\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2215004568539258&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nTripp\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2173576192720129&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nBait\nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2082595615120854&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nGym Class Basketball \nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3661420607275144&ref=oculus_desktop\n\nTea For God \nhttps://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/3762343440541585&ref=oculus_desktop\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1764400/Tea_For_God/#:~:text=Tea%20For%20God%20is%20a,and%20a%20roguelite%20shooter%2Dexplorer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvGeyqaoyY", "date_published": "2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
