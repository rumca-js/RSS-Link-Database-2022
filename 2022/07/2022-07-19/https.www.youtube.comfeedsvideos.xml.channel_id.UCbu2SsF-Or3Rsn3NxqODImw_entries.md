Mojang reveals if NFTs will have a place in Minecraft, Xbox adds Discord support and class changes are coming to Diablo Immortal.
#GamingNews #Minecraft #Xbox 

As Mojang explains in a new blog post, allowing server owners to implement NFT integration and "play to earn" features – which could reward players with NFT forms of in-game skins and items – would take "the focus away from playing the game" and allow for "profiteering." The crux of the matter comes down to the fact that allowing players to earn NFT rewards would create an ecosystem of "haves and have-nots," which goes against Minecraft's values of "inclusion and playing together." Mojang goes as far to call NFTs against the "spirit of Minecraft."

Xbox is finally introducing built-in Discord support! Later today, select Xbox Insiders will be able to try out the integration while everyone else will have to wait for the support to expand in the coming weeks. This new feature seems to only support voice chat and not Discord’s text based communication. There is also no dedicated app on Xbox yet so make sure you have your mobile device ready because you’ll need it to transfer the audio over to the console using the new “Join on Xbox”. Once you’re in a call thats been transferred over, you'll be able to see who's on call with you, and who's speaking, the same as if you're using Discord on mobile or PC. And you'll be able to adjust the sound, as well as switch between Discord Voice and Xbox game chat.

Following a new update, players will be able to convert their current character into a new class every seven days at no cost. The swap can be made at the new Shifting Flames brazier in Westmarch and players will have the option of immediately reverting back to that character's previous class should they decide they made a mistake.

## What Made Niko Bellic a Great Character

Niko Bellic is a horrible human, but he’s also a great character. In this video, DeVante breaks down what makes Niko so good even in a post-GTA 5 world.
#Gaming #GTA #grandtheftauto 

The poor guy was on a steady losing streak that didn’t get much better after the war. Unable to find a job, Niko fell into human trafficking work in order to get by.

And I know, only monsters would smuggle and sell other human beings, so that last part may not seem like it's helping me sell him as a great character. But stick with me because I believe it's deep flaws like that one that help make him believable. We’ll get to that in a second.

Following a botched smuggling run, Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Russian crime boss Ray Bulgarin. This in turn led to his decision to head to America where he thought he could start fresh with his wealthy cousin Roman. In reality, Roman was broker than the district he lived in, and America proved to be just as crime infested as other places in the world.

Niko played the cards he was dealt, tried to reshuffle, but ended up with the same hand in a new city. Rockstar made a deeply flawed character with a troubled past and made me believe that he was a guy down on his luck looking for a change. I wanted so badly for him to have at least one win, even if he technically didn’t deserve it. Because deep down we all want to believe in second chances.

Unfortunately for Niko, that second chance was harder to achieve thanks to three of his key motivating factors: money, family / loyalty and revenge. Each time Niko accepts a new mission throughout the story, one or more of these factors lie behind his decision to say yes. And just like his flaws that I hinted at earlier, knowing Niko’s ‘Why’ is another way Rockstar makes him believable.
