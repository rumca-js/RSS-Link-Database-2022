Later today, select Xbox Insiders will be able to try out the integration while everyone else will have to wait for the support to expand in the coming weeks. This new feature seems to only support voice chat and not Discord\u2019s text based communication. There is also no dedicated app on Xbox yet so make sure you have your mobile device ready because you\u2019ll need it to transfer the audio over to the console using the new \u201cJoin on Xbox\u201d. Once you\u2019re in a call thats been transferred over, you'll be able to see who's on call with you, and who's speaking, the same as if you're using Discord on mobile or PC. And you'll be able to adjust the sound, as well as switch between Discord Voice and Xbox game chat.\n\nFollowing a new update, players will be able to convert their current character into a new class every seven days at no cost. The swap can be made at the new Shifting Flames brazier in Westmarch and players will have the option of immediately reverting back to that character's previous class should they decide they made a mistake.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:05 - Minecraft\n01:10 - Xbox & Discord\n02:11 - Diablo Immortal", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH7P2n7ndoQ", "date_published": "2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What Made Niko Bellic a Great Character", "description": "Niko Bellic is a horrible human, but he\u2019s also a great character. In this video, DeVante breaks down what makes Niko so good even in a post-GTA 5 world.\n#Gaming #GTA #grandtheftauto \n\nThe poor guy was on a steady losing streak that didn\u2019t get much better after the war. Unable to find a job, Niko fell into human trafficking work in order to get by.\n\nAnd I know, only monsters would smuggle and sell other human beings, so that last part may not seem like it's helping me sell him as a great character. But stick with me because I believe it's deep flaws like that one that help make him believable. We\u2019ll get to that in a second.\n\nFollowing a botched smuggling run, Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Russian crime boss Ray Bulgarin. This in turn led to his decision to head to America where he thought he could start fresh with his wealthy cousin Roman. In reality, Roman was broker than the district he lived in, and America proved to be just as crime infested as other places in the world.\n\nNiko played the cards he was dealt, tried to reshuffle, but ended up with the same hand in a new city. Rockstar made a deeply flawed character with a troubled past and made me believe that he was a guy down on his luck looking for a change. I wanted so badly for him to have at least one win, even if he technically didn\u2019t deserve it. Because deep down we all want to believe in second chances.\n\nUnfortunately for Niko, that second chance was harder to achieve thanks to three of his key motivating factors: money, family / loyalty and revenge. Each time Niko accepts a new mission throughout the story, one or more of these factors lie behind his decision to say yes. And just like his flaws that I hinted at earlier, knowing Niko\u2019s \u2018Why\u2019 is another way Rockstar makes him believable.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKYYBBr2eIo", "date_published": "2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 \u2013 Game Overview Trailer", "description": "Get up to speed on Xenoblade Chronicles 3 which is coming out next week July 29, 2022 on the Nintendo Switch.\n\n#gaming #xenobladechronicles3 #nintendo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GjZXu7IBeE", "date_published": "2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New God of War: Ragnarok Story Details Revealed | GameSpot News", "description": "New story details for God of War: Ragnarok have been revealed, Rockstar opens 70+ new positions at various studio locations and Nintendo reveals the first free DLC for Mario Strikers: Battle League.\n#GamingNews #GodofWar #GTA\u00a0\n\nThe official PlayStation Store page for God of War: Ragnarok has been updated, and it includes what appear to be new story details.
