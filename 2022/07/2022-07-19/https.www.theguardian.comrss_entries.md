<p>Jobs data from the Office for National Statistics shows real terms pay, which accounts for inflation, fell 2.8% between March and May</p><p>The Financial Times’ retail correspondent highlights how the debate around public sector pay and strikes seems to ignore the salary hikes so far enjoyed by private sector staff: </p><p><strong>Despite<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/19/inflation-jobs-ons-uk-pay-business-live?page=with:block-62d65be48f082dc50bc2b47f#block-62d65be48f082dc50bc2b47f"> employers like Santander UK </a>attempting to combat the cost of living crisis for staff by raising salaries, there is a growing divide between public and private sector pay. </strong></p><p>Growth in total pay, including bonuses, was 6.2% on average across the entire UK workforce. But there is a stark comparison between private sector wages, which rose by 7.2%, and public sector pay, which went up just 1.5%.</p><p>It seems the government is exercising pay restraint in the face of runaway inflation, but the private sector is not. </p><p>Against such a backdrop it’s no wonder businesses are willing to cough up more to get new staff and keep existing employees on the books. </p><p>The number of vacancies fell very slightly on the last reading, which means we may have just crested off the back of the peak and could start to see some normalisation of the labour market. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/19/inflation-jobs-ons-uk-pay-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Robust review – Depardieu in cantankerous comfort zone in odd-couple comedy

<p>Gérard Depardieu plays a veteran movie star with a stalker, while Déborah Lukumuena steals the show as his minder</p><p>Here’s an odd-couple comedy drama about a grumpy, cantankerous old movie star called Georges (Gérard Depardieu), who is assigned a tough “minder” called Aïssa (Déborah Lukumuena) to look after him. Why does he need a security guard? Apparently, there’s a stalker issue (a pretty harmless-looking woman camps outside his apartment building) and he also seems to be the target of environmental activists.</p><p>Frankly, the premise for Aïssa’s presence in Georges’ life is a bit thin, and this looks as if it’s going to be a sentimental status-disparity movie like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/23/untouchable-intouchables-review-francois-cluzet">French hit Untouchable</a>, in which Omar Sy played a black caregiver for grumpy white paraplegic François Cluzet (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/upside-review-horrific-odd-couple-disability-drama-kevin-hart-bryan-cranston">recently remade with Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston</a>). Actually, Robust is a bit more interesting than that and Depardieu and Lukumuena are both pretty robust in their various ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/19/robust-review-comedy-drama-gerard-depardieu-french">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Xbox; Interior Night/Microsoft<br /></strong>A branching interactive thriller played out from different perspectives, including characters’ histories, is clever though at times repetitive</p><p>A family is on a tense road trip from Sacramento, California to St Louis, Missouri. The kid is tired; the dad seems conflicted; there’s clearly some unspoken tension between the mother and the grandfather. You get the impression that not everybody is keen on this cross-country move, but you don’t yet know why. I was just getting interested in this small-scale domestic drama when things kicked off properly: stopping at a roadside motel for the night, the little family gets caught up in an escalating stand-off when they are taken hostage by three brothers who have just robbed a sheriff.</p><p>As Dusk Falls is a branching thriller that you play out from both perspectives: the antagonists, and the victims. Your choices – what you say, what you do, how long you take to press a button to open a window or make a grab for someone’s gun – affect what happens to everyone, both immediately and hours later, at the end of the story. This develops empathy for every character, particularly when you start delving backwards and forwards through their lives after the tense set-piece of the motel stand-off. It also puts you in some horrible situations, because the interests of the people you’re playing are often at odds with each other.</p><p><a href="https://www.asduskfalls.com/">As Dusk Falls</a> is released on 19 July; £24.99.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/19/as-dusk-falls-review-superior-storytelling-elevates-this-interactive-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The artist goes on the trail of her mother’s father, a German second world war general, in this unsettling memoir of transgenerational guilt</p><p>A week after she was born to an English father and German mother, <a href="https://www.angelafindlaytalks.com/">Angela Findlay</a>’s maternal grandfather died. Yet “like a relay racer passing on a baton”, she writes, “he handed me something… just as we might inherit the physical or character traits of our forebears, we can inherit their unresolved emotions, traumas or crimes”.</p><p>Much of this strange, powerful but rather unsatisfactory memoir explores Findlay’s relationship with her difficult mother, Jutta. Glamorous, energetic and sociable, she was also a woman for whom “any allusion to weakness or failure always seemed to evoke the opposite of sympathy or compassion”. She often made remarks about her daughters’ weight and imagined futures for them involving “a sensible job with a vibrant social life, puffed up like a meringue in silk taffeta dresses, charming husband in tow”. The family learned to “tread warily” and “collude in protecting [her] inner vulnerability”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/19/in-my-grandfathers-shadow-by-angela-findlay-review-a-story-of-war-trauma-and-the-legacy-of-silence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UK hip-hop’s Mr Nice Guy is getting angry – digging into racism, his mixed-race heritage and his relationship with his estranged father</p><p>Ben Coyle-Larner is wrestling with himself. Literally, in the video for his new single, Hate, a song that sees him shelve his languid, confessional flow and nice guy persona in order to deliver lines such as “I tell you what I hate though / The same fellas getting bodied by the plainclothes” with genuine venom. The video sees a camera trained on Coyle-Larner’s snarling face as he drives down a largely empty stretch of motorway, while being jostled and harangued by alternative versions of himself in the back seat. It might be a rather heavy-handed metaphor but it’s true to the tone of the song and his new direction, one he doesn’t yet seem entirely confident in.</p><p>“The song was written in such a hateful place,” says the 27-year-old rapper, better known as Loyle Carner. The video, which he co-directed, “had to reflect that feeling of getting in your own way when you’re full of rage. You’ve got all these other people, all these other voices in your head, leading you astray or trying to push you to do the wrong things. It’s that internal battle.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/19/loyle-carner-coyle-larner-hate-hip-hop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Midfielder who likes to paint made her age-group debut against England and is ready for the step up to the Euro 2022 quarter-final</p><p>“It was here,” Laia Aleixandri says. “<em>Right</em> here.” The Spain midfielder stands on the grass, boats floating gently by on the Thames, St George’s cross fluttering from the roof of the 13th-century manor house across the lawn, and smiles. It is the perfect place to paint and, a lover of art, Aleixandri has brought her canvases with her, an escape from it all. It is also the perfect place to play and, it turns out, where it all began. “On this actual pitch,” she says.</p><p>It was a revelation to her, too. The last time England hosted a European Championship, they were based at Bisham Abbey, just as they had been when they won the 1966 World Cup. The traditional home of the national team, this time it is their quarter-final opponents Spain who are there. Aleixandri, 22 next month, did not know its history, and did not remember that it was part of her own history too, the field where she played her first game for Spain – until things fell into place a fortnight ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/19/spain-laia-aleixandri-england-euro-2022-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The old trope about middle-aged women shoplifting has (almost) turned into a reality for me. And there is something I really want</p><p>I distinctly remember, when I was young, that there was this cliche about middle-aged women: they loved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/20/nation-of-shoplifters-supermarket-self-checkout">shoplifting</a>. Not regular shoplifting, where you need a thing and can’t afford it, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause">menopause</a> shoplifting, where you don’t need the thing at all and you take it anyway. It was a staple of radio comedy and layperson psychobabble, and academics undertook genuine inquiries about what could possibly be causing it. Was it general depression or something more specific? A philosophical response to the loss of fertility and how unjust that was, perhaps? I always found that explanation rather unconvincing, but what did I know? This stuff was years off.</p><p>Then in 2001, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/winona-ryder">Winona Ryder</a> ruined it for everyone by pulling off a heist so spectacular (aged only 30!) that she single-handedly broke the cliche, and it passed out of usage. Before I got a chance to see whether shoplifting was fun or not, the social imperative had disappeared and the urge never took me, although my friend did once steal a wedding card, and if you want to know how authentically menopausal that was, she didn’t even know anyone who was getting married.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## ‘I said, Don, it’s time for you to reveal’: 50 years later, the truth behind American Pie

<p>In an expansive new documentary, Don McLean talks about the much-discussed meaning of his enduring hit song</p><p>A long, long time ago – five decades to be exact – America was roiled by wrenching generational showdowns, massive street protests, and a blazing array of social justice movements. Now, half a century later, similar events and dynamics dominate the public conversation. So, perhaps, it’s poetic that precisely five decades have elapsed since a song that captured all that cultural turmoil, American Pie, became a smash hit. “It’s a song that spoke to its time,” said Spencer Proffer, who has produced a comprehensive new documentary about the song, titled The Day the Music Died. “But it’s just as applicable now.”</p><p>In fact, American Pie has only gained in fans and expanded in meaning as it has hit successive generations and generated fresh covers. Over the years, it has been interpreted by artists from Madonna (who created a commercially triumphant, if aesthetically limp, take in 2000) to Garth Brooks to Jon Bon Jovi to John Mayer. Throughout the years, journalists have subjected the song to a Talmudic level of scrutiny, while its songwriter, Don McLean, has doled out dribs and drabs of insight into his intent. By contrast, the new documentary offers the first line-by-line deconstruction of the song’s lyrics, as well as the most detailed analysis to date of its musical evolution. “I told Don, ‘It’s time for you to reveal what 50 years of journalists have wanted to know,’” Proffer said. “This film was a concerted effort to raise the curtain.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/19/don-mclean-american-pie-documentary-the-day-the-music-died">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘My neighbour said: Do you want to be in The Empire Strikes Back?’ – Julian Glover on his amazing breaks

<p>From Bond to Indiana Jones to Game of Thrones, Julian Glover has starred in some of the biggest franchises ever. As he appears with Russell Crowe in Prizefighter, the great actor spills his secrets</p><p>‘OK,” says Julian Glover. “We talk to each other for an hour. And you extract what you want, as long as it’s nice.” We’re sitting in a cafe in Barnes, London, and it is all a little surreal. Glover, now 87, is so vividly recognisable from The Empire Strikes Back, in which he played villainous General Veers, that it’s like teleporting back to the 1980s. In fact, to look at, he seems to have altered almost not at all between starring in 1967 film Quatermass and the Pit and, say, playing the baddie in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade two decades later. What’s more, you would have easily picked him out as Grand Maester Pycelle in Game of Thrones. Basically, in the flesh, this man reminds you of every important moment on the large and small screen, from even before you were born.</p><p>Glover is a legend. How could he possibly think anyone would not be nice? Who has hurt him? He has to think back to the 1950s, to a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Julius Caesar. “One reviewer said, ‘Julian Glover’s Cassius is about as lean and hungry as Kenneth Clark.’ I didn’t care. I was damn good.” That was seven decades ago, and Clark was a famous art critic. Glover had gone angling for acting work after school, give or take a year at Rada and some national service.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/19/julian-glover-empire-strikes-back-bond-indiana-jones-game-of-thrones-russell-crowe-prizefighter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Deprived by the pandemic of their steady diet of treats, the city’s omnipresent macaques are turning to outright banditry</p><p>Food vendors in the Thai city of Lopburi can never let down their guard. Thieves are everywhere, and they are both nimble and brazen. “It’s almost every day that they take my mango and santol,” says Pan Pookyoo, who has sold fruit on the streets of Lopburi for more than three decades. “Sometimes they come and stash the peanuts,” she adds, gesturing to the vendor opposite, whose buckets of nuts and beans are subjected to frequent raids.</p><p>“They take anything they can,” agrees Somsaksri Janhon, another seller. Even his stall of hair accessories is not spared. “The comb, the mirror,” he says. “If I leave the food unattended they steal the food as well.”</p><p>A monkey enjoys a drinkable yogurt in Lopburi.
