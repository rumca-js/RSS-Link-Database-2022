Now, half a century later, similar events and dynamics dominate the public conversation. So, perhaps, it\u2019s poetic that precisely five decades have elapsed since a song that captured all that cultural turmoil, American Pie, became a smash hit. \u201cIt\u2019s a song that spoke to its time,\u201d said Spencer Proffer, who has produced a comprehensive new documentary about the song, titled The Day the Music Died. \u201cBut it\u2019s just as applicable now.\u201d</p><p>In fact, American Pie has only gained in fans and expanded in meaning as it has hit successive generations and generated fresh covers. Over the years, it has been interpreted by artists from Madonna (who created a commercially triumphant, if aesthetically limp, take in 2000) to Garth Brooks to Jon Bon Jovi to John Mayer. Throughout the years, journalists have subjected the song to a Talmudic level of scrutiny, while its songwriter, Don McLean, has doled out dribs and drabs of insight into his intent.

Glover, now 87, is so vividly recognisable from The Empire Strikes Back, in which he played villainous General Veers, that it\u2019s like teleporting back to the 1980s. In fact, to look at, he seems to have altered almost not at all between starring in 1967 film Quatermass and the Pit and, say, playing the baddie in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade two decades later. What\u2019s more, you would have easily picked him out as Grand Maester Pycelle in Game of Thrones. Basically, in the flesh, this man reminds you of every important moment on the large and small screen, from even before you were born.</p><p>Glover is a legend. How could he possibly think anyone would not be nice? Who has hurt him? He has to think back to the 1950s, to a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Julius Caesar. \u201cOne reviewer said, \u2018Julian Glover\u2019s Cassius is about as lean and hungry as Kenneth Clark.\u2019 I didn\u2019t care.
