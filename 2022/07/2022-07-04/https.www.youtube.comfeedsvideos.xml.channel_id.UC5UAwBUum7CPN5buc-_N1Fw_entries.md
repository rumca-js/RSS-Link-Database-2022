"I have nothing to hide, so I don't see why I should care about privacy".

First, are you sure you have nothing to hide? 
Unless you're the most upstanding citizen who never absolutely never did anything that could be held against them, you DO have something to hide, whether you realize it or not.

Then there are things that aren't problematic for you NOW, but could become an issue in the future.

Look at how many people got flamed online for tweets or posts dating from 10 years ago. Or just look at how law evolves: you might be lucky enough to live in a country that's quite tolerant to every gender, sex, sexual orientation, skin color, religious or political views. For now. But as recent news clearly demonstrated , that's not necessarily something that's set in stone.

And finally, there's the hacking risk.

The second misconception you often hear is "privacy is already dead, don't bother, it's impossible to stay private nowadays

If you look online, you'll find a TON of ideas, guides, and videos that do just that: tell you what is private and what isn't. Privacy respecting alternatives are EVERYWHERE.

Privacy isn't dead, it's never been so alive!

The next misconception is one that's harder to dispel: "They give me great services for free, so I think the tradeoff is worth it""

If you think your privacy doesn't matter, I think you're wrong, but you are entitled to your opinion and you have every right to consider your data a good deal in exchange for free online services.

But let's consider this for a moment. First, the services aren't free. The price for these services is your data. And another thing to consider: you could get great services elsewhere, that do the same thing, would take you a few days to learn, and can also be free of charge.

"The cloud is just someone else's computer"

Of course, if you store your files on a company's server, then yes, they're stored on a computer that doesn't belong to you. That's actually true. But there's a huge gap between storing these files on a datacenter, and people in that datacenter being able to access everything.

While Google, Microsoft, or Apple might parse everything that gets into their servers, that doesn't mean it's true of every company. A lot of companies offer end to end encryption, which means that your data leaves your computer encrypted, and arrives on the server in the same form, never being legible by anyone in the process. Or you can have your own cloud stored on your own computer.
