A report from Kotaku corroborates that neither of these remasters are moving ahead for now, and that all remakes have been \"shelved\" as the studio focuses on Grand Theft Auto 6. In a tweet replying to another user on Twitter, Tez2 also clarified that the remasters weren't in full production, more just something that was planned, with Rockstar \"looking at the Trilogy to greenlight more remasters.\"\n\nNew Call of Duty images have surfaced online. The images seem to be a mix of screens from this year\u2019s Modern Warfare 2 and an unannounced game from Treyarch, the developers of Black Ops. These leaked pics are the result of data mining from a recent Warzone Mobile update and fans have already started to speculate. One of the images that seems to be catching the most attention is the one labeled \u201cStealth\u201d. This is because it contains a F-117 Nighthawk, a stealth aircraft that became synonymous with the Gulf War.\u00a0\n\nBeginning in October, Games with Gold will no longer offer Xbox 360 games to download. Word of the change first surfaced in an email sent out to Dutch Xbox Live Gold subscribers (via Wario64). Xbox One games, however, will still be available each month. Xbox 360 Games with Gold titles will still be available for a redownload regardless of membership, as in the past. The program was originally introduced in 2013 for Xbox 360 consoles, and extended to Xbox One consoles in 2014 as a bonus for Xbox Live Gold subscribers.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - GTA 6\n01:53 - Call of Duty\n02:58 - Xbox Games with Gold", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_X9ratNENE", "date_published": "2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best Games Of 2022 (So Far)", "description": "2022 has been packed full of great games, from huge blockbusters like Elden Ring to smaller titles that might have slipped under your radar.\n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:14 - Neon White\n00:00:49 - The Quarry\n00:01:20 - Kirby and the Forgotten Land\n00:01:50 - Ghostwire: Tokyo\n00:02:15 - Horizon: Forbidden West\n00:02:45 - Tunic\n00:03:21 - Elden Ring\n00:03:54 - Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe\n00:04:20 - Nintendo Switch Sports\n00:04:43 - Destiny 2: The Witch Queen\n00:05:06 - Nobody Saves The World\n00:05:34 - Sniper Elite 5\n00:05:54 - TMNT Shredder's Revenge\n00:06:25 - Norco\n00:06:57 - Monster Hunter Rise\n00:07:52 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvgTlF8kUPM", "date_published": "2022-07-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
