Hello! Here is my analysis on VR game development and the industry right now. Turns out, VR Games are just RIDICULOUSLY hard to create- at least making a GOOD VR game. So many of the things that people have been relying on for decades just- don't apply to VR games. 

In my opinion right now the problem isn't that there aren't enough VR games, it's that VR game development cycles are so new and difficult. 

I spent the past year advising and working along side an indie VR game studio and learned a lot. 

Here is AEXLAB's game, VAIL:
