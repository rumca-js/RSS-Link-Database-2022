As Dusk Falls deftly explores themes of inherited hardship through the lens of two families who cross paths on one pivotal night. By way of incredible voice acting, a compelling and expertly written script, and a bounty of pause-worthy choices along the game's elaborate branching paths, it establishes itself as an instant classic in the narrative adventure genre.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DbNMJiNU7g", "date_published": "2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warframe Devs Reveal New Game & Duviri Paradox Gameplay", "description": "Warframe devs announce a brand new game, Xbox & Activision Blizzard\u2019s deal is getting closer to wrapping up and Xbox Game Pass gets new games for the remainder of July.\n\nWarframe developer Digital Extremes has announced a new game called Soulframe, a free-to-play action \"hybrid-MMORPG\" that is now in early development. Development on Warframe will continue as other members of the team switch to Soulframe. At TennoCon, Digital Extremes shared more footage of the open-world story expansion, The Duviri Paradox, and announced a new story expansion called Veilbreaker. It's still very early days for Soulframe, and there is no word yet on platforms or a release date.\n\nJuly 19, aka tomorrow, sees the arrival of three more games, beginning with the day-one new release As Dusk Falls for console, cloud, and PC. This is an interactive drama and the debut title from developer Interior Night, a team founded by Quantic Dream veterans. Also arriving on July 19 is Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, along with Ubisoft's Watch Dogs 2 for console, cloud, and PC. On July 21, Xbox Game Pass will add the racing game MotoGP 22 for console, cloud and PC and the RPG Torment: Tides of Numenera for console and PC.\n\nIn March, the FTC asked for more information from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to further review their acquisition deal. After the additional information is reviewed, the FTC will have 30 days to challenge the acquisition. If not, the deal can continue as planned.\n\nWe now know, thanks to VGC, that Microsoft has provided the FTC with the information it was looking for. However it's unclear if Activision Blizzard has yet provided the FTC with the proper information, if not, then the 30 days to challenge the acquisition will be put on hold until Activision Blizzard shares the requested information. Once the FTC closes the investigation, the deal will be one step closer to being finalized.\n\nSTAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - Soulframe & Warframe\n01:05 - Game Pass\n01:30 - Microsoft & Activision\n02:18 - Star Wars: Hunters", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE7yoRVSf7c", "date_published": "2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
