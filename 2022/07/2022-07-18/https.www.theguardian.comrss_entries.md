<p>Switch to RTP comes amid anger over low prize money and means races will move to Sky’s racing channel from 2024</p><p>The embarrassment of a horse race <em>sans </em>horses at Newbury on Saturday, apparently the result of a trainers’ boycott in protest at the prize money on offer, is already receding in the rearview mirror and, since this is the wacky world of racing, the next unseemly internal squabble will doubtless be along soon enough.</p><p>But one line that emerged amid the claims and counter-claims over the £6,500 race that didn’t happen bears further examination. While doing what it could to defend its overall prize money offering in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, Newbury pointed out that it plans to boost prize funds significantly from 2023 “when our new media contract comes into effect”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/19/talking-horses-newbury-prize-money-media-rights-rtp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In Britain and America unprincipled politicians are shredding policies to stop global heating – even as temperatures soar</p><p>The danger posed by heatwaves in Europe should be taken more seriously. On the continent, the <a href="https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1548432747865133058" title="">headlines</a> are about forest fires. In the UK, the story is about the country grinding to a standstill. Both views mask a deadly truth. High levels of heat are a killer, one seen retrospectively in the data on excess deaths and hospital admissions. It was only in 2008 that statisticians <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18241810/" title="">concluded</a> that as many as 70,000 people died as a result of a heatwave in Europe in 2003. By foolishly telling people to “<a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/dominic-raab-responds-heatwave-131437322.html" title="">enjoy the sunshine</a>” Dominic Raab, the UK’s deputy prime minister, proved that there is no challenge he would not rise to.</p><p>Global heating will make lethal summer temperatures more common and more extreme. Tory party members <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/07/18/tory-party-members-dont-care-net-zero-target-90pc-will-dead/">seem unconcerned</a>. The cabinet minister <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/07/18/tory-party-members-dont-care-net-zero-target-90pc-will-dead/">Alok Sharma</a> is a rare voice of reason. Yet the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/court-orders-uk-government-to-explain-how-net-zero-policies-will-reach-targets">high court</a> ruled the government’s net-zero strategy was inadequate. Judges gave ministers until March to show how emissions targets would be met. It is a worry that at least <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/09/kemi-badenoch-late-father-taught-responsibility/" title="">one of the contenders</a> in the Tory party leadership race thinks that the choice for Conservatives is either to be a party of <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/will-the-next-tory-leader-finally-ditch-net-zero-" title="">net zero or a party of low taxes</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/18/the-guardian-view-of-climate-politics-net-zero-must-stay-as-policy">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Italy’s political crisis: Draghi should stay for now | Editorial

<p>Early elections would destabilise the country, as a deeply challenging winter looms</p><p>For almost a year-and-a-half, Italy’s politics has been characterised by a highly unusual degree of stability and consensus. During Mario Draghi’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56049115" title="">premiership</a>, the country has come through the worst of the Covid pandemic and successfully laid claim to a large tranche of recovery fund money from the EU. Much of the credit for this has rightly gone to the former European Central Bank chief, who was parachuted into the role of prime minister to bring order to chaos, following the ignominious collapse of the previous government.</p><p>This period of calm, which has been highly popular with voters, was always to be time-limited. Mr Draghi has presided with skill over a broad-based national unity government created to deal with an emergency; but although he is not the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mario-Monti" title="">first unelected economist</a> to run the country, Italy is a democracy not a technocracy. Normal politics was due to resume via elections next spring. But that timetable now risks being unhelpfully accelerated, following the decision by the Five Star Movement to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/14/italian-prime-minister-mario-draghi-resigns-after-coalition-partner-snub" title="">boycott </a>a confidence vote last week. Mr Draghi promptly resigned, only to be talked out of doing so immediately by President Sergio Mattarella. But depending on the outcome of fraught negotiations, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/italy-enters-crunch-week-with-draghi-s-government-on-the-brink" title="">he may decide to go</a> this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/18/the-guardian-view-on-italys-political-crisis-draghi-should-stay-for-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Barça are spending money recklessly to maintain a myth, but in the modern superclub era it is unlikely to cost them dearly</p><p>Robert Lewandowski has signed a four-year deal with Barcelona, which means he probably has a good 18 months before they ask him to take a wage cut. Give or take. Naturally a good deal depends on how much deeper into their financial quarry Barcelona have managed to dig themselves in the meantime. Perhaps, alternatively, Lewandowski will be asked to defer a portion of his salary, or maybe amortise it into 420 easy monthly instalments, or accept payment in the form of $BAR fan tokens.</p><p>This is the perk of being the world’s biggest and most incoherent club: there is always another lever to squeeze. Bankrolled by the partial sale of their broadcast rights for the next 25 years, Barcelona have brought Lewandowski, Raphinha, Franck Kessié and Andreas Christensen to the Camp Nou this summer. César Azpilicueta, Jules Koundé and Bernardo Silva are also being pursued. In a way this is the most mystifying part of Barcelona’s spending spree, over and above the question of where the money is coming from. What sane player would join this ridiculous club in the first place? What have they been told? And just what, exactly, are Barcelona playing at?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/18/barcelonas-summer-spree-is-not-about-building-a-team-but-selling-a-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the country melting I can no longer distract myself from my fears about global heating. But speaking to activists has shown me how to counter this terror</p><p>I was chairing a Zoom event last week about carbon bombs, and how to defuse them. All over the world, as governments broadcast warm words to a warming planet, corporations are planning and lobbying for fossil fuel projects which, if they get off the ground, will sail us casually past our carbon targets – almost as if democracy itself were just a beach-body diet that everybody talked about and nobody intended to stick to. How to stop this nihilistic corporate greed? Legal avenues, direct action, political routes, or everything all at once?</p><p>As I was doing this, a message popped up in the chat from Kjell Kühne, an academic and activist and one of the panellists: “Stop biting your nails please.” “Huh,” I thought, “weird thing to say to 846 people. How does he know they’re <em>all </em>biting their nails?” Then I realised it was a private message just to me. I considered messaging back: “Chum, when you stop making this incredibly compelling case about the climate apocalypse, I’ll stop biting my nails.” Then I remembered I was supposed to be chairing and got my head back on task.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/18/climate-crisis-anxiety-denial-is-everywhere-but-this-week-its-impossible-to-ignore-our-worries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Divisive ideas such as keeping nuclear plants open and regulating autobahn are now gaining traction</p><p>Germany’s energy crisis has led the coalition government to toy with ideas that have long been seen as politically taboo, such as extending the life of unpopular nuclear power plants and – perhaps even more divisive – imposing a speed limit on the autobahn in the hope it will reduce fuel usage.</p><p>As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After they were widowed, Joe, 55, and Kim, 58, connected through a blog Joe was writing. They now live together in Murrysville, Pennsylvania</p><p>When Joe lost his wife, Debbie, to breast cancer in July 2012, he was devastated. “The earth moved under my feet. As a family, we didn’t recognise the full extent of the devastation until years later,” he says. “It’s not something you can comprehend when you’re going through it.” At the time, he was living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his two children, aged nine and 12. To cope with the pain and difficulties of his new life, he turned to blogging. “I would sit at my computer and words would just come out. I have no idea why I started, I just needed an outlet and it felt cathartic.”</p><p>Not long after he began writing, his blog was recommended to Kim, whose husband, Jack, had recently died from a brain tumour. “I was experiencing exactly the same, bringing up two children and juggling the demands at work,” she says. Grief was a big topic on the blog, but Joe also touched on other issues, like coping with milestones, such as the children’s first day back at school. “That was the post that really struck me. When the kids returned to school, I’d see these forms where my husband was listed alongside me. It was really hard.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/18/how-we-met-we-were-both-grieving-our-spouses-and-juggling-children-and-the-demands-of-work">Continue reading...</a>
