Artemis is NASA's plan to return to the moon, and this time to stay. That's something you probably already know. But there's a lot more to it than picking a lander. This video is the first of 3 videos to explore the full plan for Artemis, starting with the uncrewed and robotic missions that will set the stage for a sustainable, long-term base on the south pole of the moon.
