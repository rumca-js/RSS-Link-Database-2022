The iconic punk rock band that formed during the Riot Grrl movement in the 1990s clearly hasn\u2019t lost their relevance. Similar to the age of those dancing in the audience, the setlist spanned decades, pulling from 1997\u2019s Dig Me Out to their most recent and first self-produced album, Path of Wellness, released in 2021.\n\nThe performance was incredibly tight. After 10 albums, Sleater-Kinney are seasoned and wicked smart musicians. Vocalists and founding duo, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein know exactly how to complement and make room for each other as they wove together wails and melodies. Their sound isn\u2019t stripped down these days, but rather full with the support of a keyboardist, additional guitarist, and drummer Angie Boylan, replacement for long-time member Janet Weiss, who left the band in 2019.\n\nThe crowd kept jumping and screaming along until the very end, as Sleater-Kinney wrapped up with \u201cEntertain\u201d and \u201cModern Girl\u201d - both from 2005\u2019s The Woods and both prime examples of the band\u2019s signature critique of consumerism, gender roles and sticking to the status quo.\n\nAs always, Sleater-Kinney played like they have nothing to prove and the only role they have to fill is the one they chose. - Darby Ottoson\n\nSongs Played\n00:00:00 High in the Grass\n00:04:37 All Hands on the Bad One\n00:07:33 Bury Our Friends\n00:11:37 Worry With You\n00:15:27 Surface Envy\n00:18:32 Can I Go On?\n00:22:15 I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone \n00:26:39 Price Tag\n00:30:37 Shadow Town (plus band introduction)\n00:35:49 No Cities to Love\n00:39:14 The Fox\n00:42:24 A New Wave\n00:46:12 Reach Out\n00:50:13 Modern Girl\n00:53:26 Dig Me Out\n00:55:48 Entertain\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
