<p><strong>Businesses seeking to shrink their carbon footprint need accurate tools to measure progress. Innovations, from AI to blockchain, are making this possible</strong></p><p>With all the talk about corporate net zero targets, it is important to remember that zero is a number – it needs to be calculated, not approximated. Which is why accounting and auditing are crucial for making corporate sustainability pledges real.</p><p>But while an entire industry of financial accountancy has been developed to make financial reporting easier, when it comes to carbon accounting and emissions auditing, the task is arguably even more complex and laborious – and there is no firmly established industry of professionals to help.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-whole-picture/2022/jul/07/seeing-into-the-future-six-ways-cutting-edge-tech-can-help-monitor-sustainability">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New technology means companies can monitor materials from the start of their production journey to the end of their lifespan</p><p>Palm oil is a key ingredient in everything from soaps and shampoos to ice-cream and margarine. Farmers today produce more than <a href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=4243000&amp;sel_year=2020&amp;rankby=Production" rel="nofollow">73m tonnes of it each year</a> – more than double the amount of 20 years ago. But the rapid growth of palm fruit plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia has caused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/15/palm-oil-land-grabs-trashing-environment-and-displacing-people">major deforestation and human rights issues</a>.</p><p>An industry-wide shift to sustainable palm oil is therefore urgently needed. Palm oil supply chains are long and complex, however, spanning multiple traders, storage tanks, pipelines and oil tankers. It’s difficult and expensive for companies to establish fully segregated supply chains for sustainable palm oil, so batches that have been produced sustainably are often shipped in bulk and commingled with conventional palm oil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-whole-picture/2022/jul/07/a-blockchain-tool-that-helps-track-sustainability-from-palm-oil-to-plastics">Continue reading...</a>
