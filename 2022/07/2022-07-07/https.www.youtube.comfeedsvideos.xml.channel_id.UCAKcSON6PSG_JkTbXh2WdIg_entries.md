As Sleater-Kinney walked on-stage, a full hill of fans erupted in cheers. The iconic punk rock band that formed during the Riot Grrl movement in the 1990s clearly hasn’t lost their relevance. Similar to the age of those dancing in the audience, the setlist spanned decades, pulling from 1997’s Dig Me Out to their most recent and first self-produced album, Path of Wellness, released in 2021.

The performance was incredibly tight. After 10 albums, Sleater-Kinney are seasoned and wicked smart musicians. Vocalists and founding duo, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein know exactly how to complement and make room for each other as they wove together wails and melodies. Their sound isn’t stripped down these days, but rather full with the support of a keyboardist, additional guitarist, and drummer Angie Boylan, replacement for long-time member Janet Weiss, who left the band in 2019.

The crowd kept jumping and screaming along until the very end, as Sleater-Kinney wrapped up with “Entertain” and “Modern Girl” - both from 2005’s The Woods and both prime examples of the band’s signature critique of consumerism, gender roles and sticking to the status quo.

As always, Sleater-Kinney played like they have nothing to prove and the only role they have to fill is the one they chose. - Darby Ottoson
