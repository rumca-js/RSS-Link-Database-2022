If you ask me which instruments I regularly use in the lab, you will hear Multimeter, Oscilloscope, Transistor, or Component Tester. And for quite some time I ask myself: How is it possible to build such a versatile component tester for less than 10 dollars? After looking at the minimal parts count of such a device, I am convinced: The inventor was a Genius. Letâ€™s have a closer look.
