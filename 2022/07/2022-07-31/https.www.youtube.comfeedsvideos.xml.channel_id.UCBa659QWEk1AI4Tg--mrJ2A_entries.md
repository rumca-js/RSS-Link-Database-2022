In Soda Springs, Idaho, there's a geyser that fires carbonated water into the air, on the hour, every hour. I paid a visit. â–  Thanks to all the folks from Soda Springs who helped with this video!

Camera by Mason Scharf, Terry Gilbert, and Gregg Haney, each of whom happened to be in the right place at the right time for a different eruption: thank you all for stepping in, it looks much better than a tripod shot would!
