It's been a while since we sat down and exchanged genuine ideas. A lot of people really enjoyed the last Ray Gun Recap, which I'm stoked about, but some of you had some blazing takes that I couldn't just leave alone. So, buckle up. It's clobbering time. That's a copyrighted phrase? That can't be real. The Thing says it? Like from the horror movie? No? The Fantastic Four? Ugh. Fine. Whatever, I talk into the camera and I think it's slightly interesting, go nuts. Jerk.
