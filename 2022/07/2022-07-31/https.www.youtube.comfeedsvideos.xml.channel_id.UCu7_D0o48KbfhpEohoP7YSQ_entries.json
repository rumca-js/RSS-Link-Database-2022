And for quite some time I ask myself: How is it possible to build such a versatile component tester for less than 10 dollars? After looking at the minimal parts count of such a device, I am convinced: The inventor was a Genius. Let\u2019s have a closer look.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwyP4Yd0-O49e05kMUJgQQ\n\nLinks:\nTransistor (Component) Tester: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmKpIWL or https://amzn.to/3Jg2CVQ or http://bit.ly/2nFgNOn\nDescription: https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR_Transistortester\nManual: https://github.com/svn2github/transistortester/tree/master/Doku/tags/english\n\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (no additional cost for you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGithub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
