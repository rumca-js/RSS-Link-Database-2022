According to those documents, Sony believes that once Microsoft owns the Call of Duty franchise as part of the acquisition, it'll have the power to influence users' console choices.\n\nThe funny thing about this is that PlayStation has been using Call of Duty to influence player console choice for years now by having exclusive and/or early access to content. For example, 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare launched with a co-op spec ops survival mode as a PS4 exclusive feature.   \n\nIn other PlayStation news, Sony is doing away with PS5's accolades this fall. Accolades was a launch feature on PS5, and players could give medals like helpful, welcoming, and good sport to others in multiplayer games. In theory, Sony implemented the accolades system to reduce toxicity. But in practice, nobody really knew that this system existed, to say nothing of actually using it--a fact Sony acknowledged in the discontinuation announcement.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company has announced that a new Pok\u00e9mon Presents will be streamed on August 3 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on its YouTube channel. The next games in the series, Scarlet and Violet, will be the main event for this week's presentation, and it's likely that the video will have a few more pocket monsters to reveal. As for the other games that will be shown at Wednesday\u2019s stream, there's a whole lot of Pok\u00e9mon projects currently active, ranging from mobile games Pok\u00e9mon Unite to Pok\u00e9mon Masters, as well as apps for the franchise such as Pok\u00e9mon Home.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:07 - Call of Duty\n01:30 - PS5 Feature\n02:10 - Pok\u00e9mon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFGCml3PZA", "date_published": "2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cat Behavior Expert Reacts To Stray", "description": "JoAnna Puzzo, a Feline Welfare Manager at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, breaks down the various antics of the cats in Stray, including some of their behavioral traits, and of course, the odd moment of mischief.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:43 - Cat Colony Behavior\n02:47 - Cats knocking things off shelves\n02:59 - Defense mechanisms\u00a0\n04:28 - Cats wearing clothes\n05:33 - Greeting behavior\n06:13 - Sleeping behavior\n06:53 - Cats walking on stuff they really shouldn\u2019t be\n07:27 - Cat getting stuck in a paper bag\n08:08 - Injury behavior\n09:07 - Playful behavior\n09:52 - Cats tripping people up\n10:30 - JoAnna\u2019s final thoughts\n\nIn the latest video in GameSpot\u2019s Expert Reacts series, JoAnna Puzzo--a Feline Welfare Manager at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home--breaks down the feline antics of the Stray.\n\nSupport Battersea Cats And Dogs Home: www.battersea.org.uk/support-us\n\nPet Advice: /www.battersea.org.uk/pet-advice\n\nBattersea Twitter: twitter.com/battersea_\n\nBattersea Instagram: www.instagram.com/battersea/\n\nMeet Kipp: www.battersea.org.uk/cats/kipp", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgvC854IeN0", "date_published": "2022-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
