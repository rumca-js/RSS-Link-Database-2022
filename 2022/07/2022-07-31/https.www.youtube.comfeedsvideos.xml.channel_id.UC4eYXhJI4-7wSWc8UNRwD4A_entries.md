“This feels like a moment where I’m restarting, in a way – a new beginning to a career that I’ve worked so hard at for so long,” says 2022 Tiny Desk Contest winner Alisa Amador.

Amador entered the Contest 5 times before winning, becoming the first artist in over 800 days to play a concert at the Tiny Desk with an audience; she also headlined our cross-country Tiny Desk Contest On The Road tour.
This is Alisa Amador’s journey.

The Tiny Desk Contest is supported by State Farm.
