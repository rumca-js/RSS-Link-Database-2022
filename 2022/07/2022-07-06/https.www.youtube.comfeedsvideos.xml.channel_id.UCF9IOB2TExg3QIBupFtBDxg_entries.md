Monkeypox is a zoonotic infection

Monkeypox virus

Endemic in West and Central Africa

UK, between 2018 and 2021

7 cases

Epidemiological links to imported cases

4 were imported

2 were cases in household contacts

1 health care worker

No documented community transmission until 6th May 2022

Outbreak mainly (96%) been in homosexual and bisexual men

(without history of travel to endemic countries)

Cases, history of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the last year (54.2%),

and 10 or more sexual partners in the last 3 months (31.8%)

Monkeypox is being transmitted in interconnected sexual networks that sustain STI transmission

UK, up to 4 July 2022

1,351 laboratory confirmed cases

(Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory,RIPL) 

40 in Scotland

11 in Northern Ireland

15 in Wales

1,285 in England (77% in London)

6 confirmed cases in women

Median age, 36 years (interquartile range 31 to 43)

Monkeypox outbreak: vaccination strategy

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-outbreak-vaccination-strategy

Smallpox Modified Vaccinia Ankara – Bavarian Nordic

For pre and post exposure

The committee

Using markers of high-risk behaviour,

Similar to those used to assess eligibility for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

These risk criteria would include

a recent history of multiple partners, 

participating in group sex, 

attending sex on premises venues,

or a proxy marker such as recent bacterial STI

European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe)

https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu

5,949 cases of monkeypox, from 33 European countries

99 cases where sequencing was available,

confirmed to be of the West African clade

Implications for HIV-Positive Men

40% of cases were also (364/917) HIV-positive

99% of those with known sexual orientation stated they were MSM or bisexual

ECDC and WHO/Europe

Reported cases presented with a rash (96.1%)

Systemic symptoms (69%)

fever, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, sore throat, or headache

Hospitalised, 9.9%

intensive care, 0.2%

Fifteen European cases, health workers

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

I continue to be concerned by the scale and spread of the virus

Testing remains a challenge and it's highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up

Why are people dying more than normal?

UK, excess deaths

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/07/05/excess-deaths-rise-not-covid/

Hundreds more people than usual are dying each week in England and Wales

Not from Covid

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

Covid deaths, UK

w/e 24 June, 346

w/e 17 June, 309

Total deaths registered in the UK

12,278

15.9% above the five-year average

Latest breakdown, (England and Wales)

Excess deaths = 1,540

Covid deaths, 285

58.2% of this 285 gave covid as the underlying cause

So, 166 from covid

119 with covid

Non covid excess deaths, 1,540 – 166 = 1,374

Other settings, 10.1% above

Health experts call for urgent investigation

Pandemic response

Lockdown and restrictions stress

Reduced physical activity

Lack of access to healthcare

Delayer referrals for diagnosis and treatment

Cost of living crisis

People whose health was / is weakened by covid

Known increase risk of stroke and heart attacks

Vaccination

Increasing autoimmune disease

New medications used as covid treatments

Prof Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia

I think the reality is going to be quite complex but it’s something we do need to be aware of and actually try and understand.

There is despair from your livelihood disappearing up the swanny. 

It doesn’t have to lead to suicide, chronic stress can lead to all sorts of problems.

Dr Charles Levinson, DoctorCall

The reasons behind these horrific numbers are complicated and none of us fully understand them, so that is exactly why there should be an urgent and comprehensive Government inquiry.

If anything, the situation seems to be worsening. 

Considering the relentless focus on one virus for more than two years, 

requesting answers from Government on thousands and thousands of non-Covid excess deaths is entirely reasonable.
