Elden Ring Legend Let Me Solo Her receives an epic gift from developers, a GTA 5 modder gets a takedown notice from Take-Two, ReedPop is taking over E3 and Skulls and Bones gets new gameplay and a release date.
#GamingNews #EldenRing #gta5 

Elden Ring’s most famous cooperative player “Let Me Solo Her” was gifted a massive box set from Bandai Namco and From Software, including a sword. Let Me Solo Her rose to prominence by fighting Malenia, one of the toughest bosses in Elden Ring, for players that were having a hard time. The name Let Me Solo Her encouraged other players to stay back and let him do the work. Armed with nothing but a katana and a pot helmet, Let Me Solo Her would dominate Malenia with almost scientific precision, assisting hundreds players in vanquishing the now-infamous boss.

Now let's talk about a company sending something not so pleasant. Rockstar parent company Take-Two has reportedly issued a DMCA takedown against modder LukeRoss, best known for making VR mods of games like GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2. LukeRoss shared a post on Patreon detailing the notice that read, "They are demanding that I remove all their copyright works from my Patreon page. I immediately asked for clarifications, since it is my belief that I'm not hosting any such materials."

And in a bit of unrelated news, E3 has made another announcement about its return and this time Reedpop is running the show. Reedpop--which also runs PAX, Star Wars Celebration, and several other shows--will work in partnership with the Entertainment Software Association to host publishers, developers, journalists, and consumers at E3's usual location, the Los Angeles Convention Center.

And finally, after years of development and multiple delays, Ubisoft's pirate game Skull and Bones has a release date of November 8… The day before God of War: Ragnarok.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Could Be Nintendo’s Biggest Game Yet

Xenoblade Chronicles is back and it’s bigger than ever. We got a hands-on preview of the opening chapter of Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

Xenoblade Chronicles’ impressive scale has always been a selling point for the series. Nintendo’s traditionally underpowered hardware has never stopped the appropriately named developer--Monolith Soft--from creating massive worlds, and based on what I’ve played so far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is no different. While the early hours are railroaded with cutscenes, tutorials, and linear areas, when the game opens up, it really opens up.

Does Xenoblade Chronicles 3 buckle under it's massive scale? It's hard to say at this point. so be sure to check out our review in the coming weeks. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 comes to Nintendo Switch on July 29.

It's official! God of War: Ragnarok has a release date! This continuation of the best father/son story in gaming will hit shelves on November 9 for PS5 and PS4. Four editions will be available at launch, and preorders will start on July 15 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET. If you preorder any edition of Ragnarok, you'll receive two in-game cosmetics: Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. These are "Launch Edition" bonuses, so the code will be in the box or added to your PlayStation account upon purchasing a digital version.

Forspoken, the action RPG from Square Enix, has been pushed from October to January 24, 2023. In a statement the company said "all game elements" are completed, and the remaining development time will be used for "final polishing." Forspoken was originally revealed as Project Athia before getting its final title. The game follows protagonist Frey Holland (played by Ella Balinska from Charlie's Angels), a contemporary New Yorker with a cat named Homer, who gets transported to the magical world of Athia.

Bungie, the developer behind Destiny, and Chinese tech company NetEase are reportedly working on a new first-person shooter mobile game. As reported by The Gaming Post, a LinkedIn profile of one of the NetEase Games artists indicates that the company is helping Bungie create "an unannounced FPS mobile game." Neither Bungie nor NetEase have announced any plans for a new mobile game, but a source with knowledge of the development plans told the publication that the team is currently working on a new Destiny game.
