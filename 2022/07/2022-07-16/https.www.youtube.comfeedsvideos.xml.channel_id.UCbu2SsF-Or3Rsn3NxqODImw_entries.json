Gimmicks First Person Games Tried That Didn't Work", "description": "First-person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, tactical games like the Ghost Recon series, and old-school games like Duck Hunt have all been part of one of the most wildly successful types of video games: the shooter. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been plenty of silly inventions, questionable technologies, and flat-out bad ideas along the way. Let\u2019s look back at hilarious ideas developers tried, from early virtual reality to PlayStation's rave glow stick, the Move Motion Controller, that never quite worked.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that first-person, third-person, and multiplayer shooters are some of the most popular categories of video games, but the road to developers making the perfect experience is littered with hilarious peripherals, gimmicks, technology too far ahead of its time to function well, and some laughably bad ideas. In this video, we\u2019re going to take a look at some of the most memorable failed attempts, like early virtual reality prototypes in malls inspired by movies such as The Lawnmower Man and books such as Snow Crash. We\u2019re exploring the unexpected negative impact of flatscreen TVs on light gun games and the slow death of toy gun peripherals. We\u2019re looking at how developers tried for years afterward to keep light gun games alive with silly-looking inventions like Killzone 3 using PlayStation Move Motion Controllers on the PlayStation 3. We\u2019re going to the logical endgame of motion control, when Kinect for Xbox 360 tried to make players completely imagine controllers altogether; RIP Kinect. We\u2019re diving into how tactical games like SOCOM for the PlayStation 2 brought in squad voice commands long before speech recognition technology was good enough to make it work, leading to frustrating squad kills. Then we\u2019ll have a look at some of the modern haptic inventions attempting to improve on the time-tested controller rumbler that keeps getting better and better, most recently with the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense Controller with adaptive triggers. That means exploring haptic vests and butt rumblers.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to experiment with some of these older technologies for yourself, many can still be found online or in vintage shops like the NES Zapper, PS2 GunCon, and Socom U.S. Navy Seals PS2 headset. A remade version of the early VR game Dactyl Nightmare can be found on Oculus VR devices. Kinect games for the Xbox 360 still work to this day, and I highly recommend them, just not the shooter ones.\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n0:24 - Dactyl Nightmare\n1:22 - Light Gun Games After CRT TVs\n2:56 - Kinect\n5:11 - SOCOM Voice Commands\n6:26 - Haptic Suits \n7:54 - Outro\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keyDD-Eqom0&t \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGzvCaw62Y\n\n#gaming #fps #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgQxMTYrM7Q", "date_published": "2022-07-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To MORE Valorant Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down more of the weaponry of Valorant, including the Sheriff revolver, the Odein machine gun, and the Operator sniper rifle.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:42 - Classic\n03:12 - Stinger\n04:51 - Operator\n07:18 - Guardian\n10:24 - Odin\n14:36 - Sheriff\n17:33 - Ending\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down more of the guns of Valorant and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ5tDVExpzs", "date_published": "2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "IST - BOTW's Most Powerful Glitch Of 2022 Explained", "description": "Breath of the Wild's newest discovery, IST, or Inventory Slot Transfer, is the newest key to unlocking Nintendo's secrets, such as creating the patched Ice Cream elixir, duplicating items, exploring the end of the game, and finally modifying weapons in powerful ways.\n\n#gaming #breathofthewild #glitch\n\nFound first by zxrobin, Inventory Slot Transfer can manipulate the menu and inventory items in ways never seen before. This leads to incredible abilities, starting from basic item duplication, to duplicating stamina meals hundreds of times for endless stamina, create tens of thousands of fairies and become invincible to never care about being hit again, even glitch the save prompt using Save Prompt Storage into cutscenes to save and load into that cutscene, and explore a peaceful liberated Hyrule, with calamity\u2019s pillars blue and a malice-free world, the last canon state of Hyrule before Breath of the Wild 2. But that's not even the best part, we\u2019ve finally accessed the world of customizing weapon modifiers and putting them on weapons normally impossible, and unlock official modifiers Nintendo never released, like 10 wide shot bows, 10 linear shot bows, This is the closest we can get to activating cheats in Breath of the Wild, and there is likely more to be found with this massive glitch in the future.\u00a0\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 What it's capable of\n1:27 WARNING\n2:37 How to do base IST\n5:26 IST Explained\n8:08 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbthdP2SkNA", "date_published": "2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Soulframe Reveal Trailer", "description": "Digital Extremes the makers of Warframe have revealed a brand new game Soulframe today during Tennolive 2022.
