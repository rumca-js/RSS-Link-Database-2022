You'll note\nthat this isn't exactly a &quot;Learn X in 24 hours&quot; kind of journey, as it stretches\nover a long time period and covers lots of different materials. YMMV.</p>\n<p>This learning journey alternates consuming information (mostly books) with\ncoding activities (some guided by books, some not). In my experience, both are\ncritical for really learning a language or any other tool deeply, and the\ncombination of the two is powerful.</p>\n<div class="}]
