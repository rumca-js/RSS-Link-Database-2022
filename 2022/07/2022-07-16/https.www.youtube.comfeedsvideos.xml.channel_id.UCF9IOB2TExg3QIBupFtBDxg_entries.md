Cool ASAP using water and fans. Splash all over with water or immerse in water.

Heatstroke (acute hyperthermia)

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20353581

Prolonged exposure to hot (often humid) environments

Physical exercise in hot environments

104 째F    40 째C   

105.1 째F 40.6 째C   

A medical emergency

Disorientation

Can quickly damage brain, heart, kidneys, muscles

Damage worsens if treatment delayed

Symptoms

High body temperature

Altered mental state or behaviour

Skin, often hot, red and dry at first

Nausea and vomiting
Tachycardia

Tachypnoea

Headache

A medical emergency

Get help and get them cooled

Factors

Excess heat production

Exercise

Excessive environmental heat

Sun

Humidity

Impaired heat loss

Clothes

Dehydration

Alcohol

Risk factors

Young children

Over 65s

Lack of time to acclimatise

Lack of AC / fans

Meds, beta blockers, diuretics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, amphetamines, cocaine

Chronic illnesses, heart or lung disease, obese, unfit

Prevent

Good hydration

Loose fitting, lightweight clothes

Prevent sunburn

Delay workouts

Rearrange work schedules

Parked cars

Take time to acclimatize

Science

Hypothalamus set point is normal,

but is overwhelmed

Failure of thermal homeostatic mechanisms

Unlike fever where set point is deliberately increased by cytokines

Enzymic function

Pro inflammatory cytokine release

Inflammation

Damage to vascular endothelium

Intravascular coagulation of blood

Thermal coagulation

Disruption of intestinal barriers

Heat exhaustion
