The time that has passed since your original infection is much shorter with Omicron, so it’s really not a fair comparison

UK Health Security Agency 15% of people in England have never had Covid

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/22/why-do-the-minority-who-havent-had-covid-account-for-most-new-infections

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata

About 15% of people in England have never had Covid

this minority group still accounts for 55% of infections

45% of cases are now reinfections

the lowest it has been since the start of the pandemic,

UKHSA estimated more than 10 million people had still never been infected

First-time infections

More likely to be symptomatic

Fewer subsequent infections identified

Many people are being reinfected but not noticing

So % of reinfections may actually be more than 45%
