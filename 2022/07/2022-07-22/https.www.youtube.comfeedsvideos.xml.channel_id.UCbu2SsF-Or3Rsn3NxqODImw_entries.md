Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is the latest game in Monolith Soft and Tetsuya Takashi's anthology Xeno series releasing to the Nintendo Switch. Here is everything you need to know about Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
#Xenoblade #Xenoblades #Xenobladechronicles #Xenosaga Chronicles 3 

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set in the world of Aionios, which is notable for its 2 major nations of Keves and Agnus - who constantly war with one another. Characters from Keves and Agnus only have 10 year life spans dubbed "terms".

In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you control 6 primary characters, 3 from Keves, and 3 from Agnus, who become unlikely allies and friends, who will end up fighting together to discover the truth of the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. In order to fight, each character starts with a primary class with its own set of arts to use in fightings - however, can switch classes and arts in-between fighting to level up and learn all new master arts that can be equipped regardless of class.

Some of the classes available included Swordfighter, Zephyr, Medic Gunner, Tactician, Heavy Guard, Ogre, Guardian Commander, Incursor, and War Medic.

Importantly, each of the main characters has another character they'll be able to interlink with. This fuses the two characters you choose together into a mech-like form called an Ouroboros for a limited set amount time. These Ouroboros also have special arts, however not constrained by the same limits as the characters on their own.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 releases July 29, 2022, with additional content releasing later this year, and into next year through a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass for an additional cost.

New Assassin’s Creed details have leaked, plus Last of Us Part 1 and Nintendo Switch Sports are getting new features.
#GamingNews #AssassinsCreed #TLoU 

Kotaku reported on Project Red's existence, while Bloomberg's Jason Schreier said Project Red is part of AC Infinity as opposed to a separate game. Sources speaking to Kotaku said this game, whatever it may be, could be set in Asia. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb previously said it may be set in Japan. During an earnings report call, the company mentioned a delay for another "smaller, premium unannounced title." Reports now indicate the game in question is Assassin's Creed Rift, a new standalone AC game that was originally meant to be a DLC episode for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

Naughty Dog has revealed more details on how the game has been remade for PS5 and PC in a new deep-dive video. While the core gameplay is essentially the same, players can expect graphical upgrades, new features, and enhancements that make the game more accessible. Some of the new features outlined in a PS Blog post include a new permadeath mode, a speedrun mode, an updated photo mode, unlockable costumes for Joel and Ellie, and a model-viewer mode.

Nintendo has announced that it will be adding full motion control support for soccer in Switch Sports on July 26. The upcoming free update is scheduled to go live at 6PM PT / 9PM ET and will include a number of new features including the ability for players to use the motion of their legs to kick the soccer ball in-game when using the leg strap accessory. Players will also be able to use their hands by jogging in place to dash in-game. Nintendo explained that playing this way will translate users' in-game kicks to be more powerful.
