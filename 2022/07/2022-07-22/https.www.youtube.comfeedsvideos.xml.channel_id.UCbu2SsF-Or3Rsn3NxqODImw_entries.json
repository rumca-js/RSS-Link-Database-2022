Characters from Keves and Agnus only have 10 year life spans dubbed \"terms\".\n\nIn Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you control 6 primary characters, 3 from Keves, and 3 from Agnus, who become unlikely allies and friends, who will end up fighting together to discover the truth of the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. In order to fight, each character starts with a primary class with its own set of arts to use in fightings - however, can switch classes and arts in-between fighting to level up and learn all new master arts that can be equipped regardless of class.\n\nSome of the classes available included Swordfighter, Zephyr, Medic Gunner, Tactician, Heavy Guard, Ogre, Guardian Commander, Incursor, and War Medic.\n\nImportantly, each of the main characters has another character they'll be able to interlink with. This fuses the two characters you choose together into a mech-like form called an Ouroboros for a limited set amount time. These Ouroboros also have special arts, however not constrained by the same limits as the characters on their own.\n\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 releases July 29, 2022, with additional content releasing later this year, and into next year through a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass for an additional cost.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hxh4MGahRU", "date_published": "2022-07-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "All-New PlayStation Plus: Everything You Need To Know", "description": "The all-new PlayStation Plus is a service made of three membership plans, each offering a wide selection of games for all tastes to download or stream.

Sources speaking to Kotaku said this game, whatever it may be, could be set in Asia. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb previously said it may be set in Japan. During an earnings report call, the company mentioned a delay for another \"smaller, premium unannounced title.\" Reports now indicate the game in question is Assassin's Creed Rift, a new standalone AC game that was originally meant to be a DLC episode for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\n\nNaughty Dog has revealed more details on how the game has been remade for PS5 and PC in a new deep-dive video. While the core gameplay is essentially the same, players can expect graphical upgrades, new features, and enhancements that make the game more accessible. Some of the new features outlined in a PS Blog post include a new permadeath mode, a speedrun mode, an updated photo mode, unlockable costumes for Joel and Ellie, and a model-viewer mode.\n\nNintendo has announced that it will be adding full motion control support for soccer in Switch Sports on July 26. The upcoming free update is scheduled to go live at 6PM PT / 9PM ET and will include a number of new features including the ability for players to use the motion of their legs to kick the soccer ball in-game when using the leg strap accessory. Players will also be able to use their hands by jogging in place to dash in-game.
