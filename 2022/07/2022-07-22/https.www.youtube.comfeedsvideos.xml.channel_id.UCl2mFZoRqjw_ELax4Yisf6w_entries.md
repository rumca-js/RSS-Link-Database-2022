00:00 - Intro
00:40 - Retractions from prior video - correcting errors
01:45 - Watching the footage
02:30 - They "don't understand" how it's ok to take an unarmed man's life
03:01 - Let's look at Jose Alba
03:35 - Would this criminal have been a bully to someone his own size/age?
04:20 - Louis clarifies the bro code
04:57 - Louis says the quiet part out loud
05:05 - Eric Adams says the quiet part out loud - good on Eric Adams!
06:04 - Mr. Simon didn't "deserve" to die
06:55 - Reason hits the nail on the head
07:44 - Let's read & interpret New York law
09:28 - In sane parts of the US, they would've thrown Jose a parade.
09:57 - If you want stores to open in your neighborhood, you have to stop simping for the criminal
10:08 - If Simon didn't deserve to get stabbed for hitting Jose, then why does Jose deserve to be assaulted because he non-violently took back a bag of potato chips?
10:55 - Were these pleasant people?
11:46 - Bodega owners are routinely treated horribly
12:18 - Simon has a boxcutter and this...makes it better?
13:14 - I guarantee people simping for the criminal haven't bee on Jose's end of this story before.
