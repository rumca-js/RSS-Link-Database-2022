The Hudson River Special Flight Rules Area is an incredible thing: unrestricted airspace right next to Manhattan. We flew it. â–  Thanks to John De Groot, and to Century Air (who mostly provide pilot training, so I'm grateful that they took the time to arrange this!): http://centuryair.com/ - this is not sponsored, I paid for my flight and their time.

The flight and radio procedures in this video have been significantly shortened for time, and operations over the city were pre-approved with local air traffic control. This is not intended as a substitute for proper instruction or for reference.
