Autojump starts maintaining a database of the folders you visit based on your history, the more you visit a folder, the higher it's weight in the database.\n\nRanger\n\nhttps://github.com/ranger/ranger\n\nIf the ls command is not enough for your file management needs, you can also use ranger. it's a command line file manager that uses the vim keyboard shortcuts to navigate and interact with files.\n\nTheF*ck\n\nhttps://github.com/nvbn/thef*ck  (replace the \"*\" by a \"u\", of course)\n\nSo, the F*ck is a project that will autocorrect your mistakes when you type a command. Let's say you're trying to install a package on Fedora.\n\nIt will work with a LOT of different errors, like mistyping an argument, or command, forgetting an argument, and a lot more stupid mistakes.\n\nTLDR\n\nhttps://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr\n\nAnother super helpful command is TLDR. If you're starting with the command line, or trying to learn a new command, you might find the --help option insufficient, and the man command way too overstuffed with text.\n\nCaniuse\n\nhttps://github.com/sgentle/caniuse-cmd\n\nThere is an easy way to check which browser supports what, with the \"caniuse\" command. You probably already know about the caniuse website, but you can also check it through your terminal, by just typing caniuse followed by the property or feature you want to use.\n\nedex-UI\n\nhttps://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/blob/master/README.md\n\nIt basically displays a ton of system information, multiple terminals, your filesystem, your network usage, an on screen keyboard for touch users, and more!\n\nespeak-ng\n\nhttps://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng\n\nespeak-ng lets you type any sentence you like, and have your computer read it. It supports multiple voices, which you can list with the --voices option, and invoke by adding the argument -v followed by the voice name.\n\nGifgen\n\nhttps://github.com/lukechilds/gifgen\n\nThis little tool will let you turn any video file into an animated image, and it lets you specify the framerate, with the -f option, and even select which portion of the video you want to keep, with the -b option to set the beginning time, and the -d option to set the duration.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFh1acsQ8DQ", "date_published": "2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
