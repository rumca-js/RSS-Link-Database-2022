Yet here, the band is brightly lit for its Tiny Desk (home) concert \u2014 which it filmed at MASS MoCA (Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art), playing new songs from its 11th studio album Time Skiffs \u2014 and the band's musical journey remains transfixing.\n\nThe four members known by their monikers Deakin, Panda Bear, Avey Tare and Geologist are joined by a silent \"time skiff rider,\" dressed mysteriously in a hooded robe, who cuts paper shapes at a tiny desk as the band's music unfolds.\n\nThe set begins as Animal Collective's new album opens, with \"Dragon Slayer\" morphing into \"Car Keys.\" The abstract words ping back and forth between Deakin, Panda Bear and Avey Tare, resembling a secret code to which only they hold the key: \"I saw a red kite fly / Was it held by an anchor? / I saw a red kite burn / I saw a string gone astray.\"\n\nThe final track \"Kings Walk\" is for those truly dedicated to the collective. It's an unreleased, vocal-heavy song that Animal Collective has been performing since 2019. With lyrics as abstract as Mary Lum's Assembly (Lorem Ipsum), the artwork filling the MASS MoCA walls behind the band, the music feels challenging, not always welcoming. It's a path in music that perhaps you've never taken, but may want to take again once you do.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dragon Slayer\" \n\"Car Keys\"\n\"Kings Walk\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAvey Tare: bass, vocals\nPanda Bear: drums, vocals\nGeologist: electronics, hurdy-gurdy\nDeakin: keys, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nDirected by Tony Giambrone\nDirector of Photography: Ben Townsend\nFilmed by Sophie Schieli, Will Kempner, Ben Townsend and Tony Giambrone\nEdited by Tony Giambrone\nColor Correction by Ben Townsend\nRecorded & Mixed by Alex Finlay V\nRecording Assisted by Chris Freeman\nArtwork featured in the video: Mary Lum, Assembly (Lorem Ipsum) 2017 commissioned by MASS MoCA\nSpecial thanks to Mark Hubatsek\nFilmed at MASS MoCA, North Adams, Mass.\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #AnimalCollective", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvIllmsp1J4", "date_published": "2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
