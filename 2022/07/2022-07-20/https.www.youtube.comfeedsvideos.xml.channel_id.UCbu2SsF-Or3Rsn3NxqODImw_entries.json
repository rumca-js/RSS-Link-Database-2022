As with the original Saints Row, the new game is all about creating your own criminal empire--but you have a long way to go before that happens. It's set in the new city of Santo Ileso, a fictional location in the United States' Southwest that mixes an urban center, suburbs, and desert locations, and carries the vibe of places such as Las Vegas or Albequrque, without being quite like either.\n \nThough we know you're eventually going to become a crime kingpin, the game starts with your humble beginnings, when your character is living in a dingy apartment with three friends: mechanic and driving wiz Neenah, entrepreneurial expert Eli, and shirtless DJ and resident cook Kev. Everyone in the group is familiar with petty crime, and both Neenah and Kev are members of local gangs. Neenah's with Los Panteros, a gang that's focused on cars and weight-lifting, while Kev hangs around with the Idols, a band of techno-anarchists who believe in a decentralized future. You're a member of the third \"gang\" in town, and the only legitimate one: a private military corporation called Marshall Defense Industries.\n\nSo at the start of Saints Row, your goal is to climb the corporate ladder as a mercenary at Marshall, mostly focused on bringing home enough rent money to keep you and your friends from eviction. Trying to find a way to \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" and fight an economic system stacked against you is a pretty pervasive theme in Saints Row--at one point, Neenah mentions the driving force for her doing crimes is to earn money to pay off her student loans. Your character is already a talented killer full of bravado, so the opportunity to earn bonus pay for performing well incentivizes you to become a one-person maverick murder machine.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7e40_DjGoU", "date_published": "2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "FIFA 23 Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "Get a glimpse of FIFA 23 in this latest reveal trailer that showcases Hypermotion 2 technology, gameplay and more!\n\nWelcome to The World\u2019s Game.

In this video, DeVante breaks down what makes Niko so good even in a post-GTA 5 world.\n#Gaming #GTA #grandtheftauto \n\nThe poor guy was on a steady losing streak that didn\u2019t get much better after the war. Unable to find a job, Niko fell into human trafficking work in order to get by.\n\nAnd I know, only monsters would smuggle and sell other human beings, so that last part may not seem like it's helping me sell him as a great character. But stick with me because I believe it's deep flaws like that one that help make him believable. We\u2019ll get to that in a second.\n\nFollowing a botched smuggling run, Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Russian crime boss Ray Bulgarin. This in turn led to his decision to head to America where he thought he could start fresh with his wealthy cousin Roman. In reality, Roman was broker than the district he lived in, and America proved to be just as crime infested as other places in the world.\n\nNiko played the cards he was dealt, tried to reshuffle, but ended up with the same hand in a new city. Rockstar made a deeply flawed character with a troubled past and made me believe that he was a guy down on his luck looking for a change. I wanted so badly for him to have at least one win, even if he technically didn\u2019t deserve it. Because deep down we all want to believe in second chances.\n\nUnfortunately for Niko, that second chance was harder to achieve thanks to three of his key motivating factors: money, family / loyalty and revenge. Each time Niko accepts a new mission throughout the story, one or more of these factors lie behind his decision to say yes. And just like his flaws that I hinted at earlier, knowing Niko\u2019s \u2018Why\u2019 is another way Rockstar makes him believable.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKYYBBr2eIo", "date_published": "2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 \u2013 Game Overview Trailer", "description": "Get up to speed on Xenoblade Chronicles 3 which is coming out next week July 29, 2022 on the Nintendo Switch.\n\n#gaming #xenobladechronicles3 #nintendo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GjZXu7IBeE", "date_published": "2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
