Two Mormons, Jeff and Neal Harmon, and an orthodox Jew, Matthew Faraci, stop by The Babylon Bee to tell the story about Angel Studios. Angel Studios was sued by Disney and ordered to pay a company-crushing $62 million judgment to Disney over its VidAngel service. That should have been the end of them. Then they went on to produce Dry Bar Comedy and The Chosen, which is the top crowd-funded film project of all time and has been seen by hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide.
