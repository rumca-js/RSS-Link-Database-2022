GTA Online’s next free expansion is called Criminal Enterprises. In the expansion you will take on a new mission called Operation Paper Trail as an agent of the International Affairs Agency to see if the Duggan petrochemical family are deliberately manipulating the fuel market. Rockstar says fans should keep an eye out for a "comprehensive list" of "new gameplay and experience improvements" across all of GTA Online. The developer will share further details on the gameplay and balance changes for the Criminal Enterprises expansion on July 26 when the expansion arrives. As usual, this new update is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but not PS3 or Xbox 360.

In other news, Bandai Namco has confirmed Dragon Ball: The Breakers will release on October 14. The game pits seven "survivors"--non-powered human characters--against one player controlling iconic villains (or Raiders) from across the Dragon Ball universe. The seven must survive until the end of the match, using items and perks against the villain, who wins by eliminating all other players. 

A closed network test for Dragon Ball: The Breakers was also confirmed, which will take place on August 5-6 across four sessions. The times for those sessions is as follows: 

August 5
7 PM PT / 10 PM ET to 11 PM PT / 2 AM ET

## Saints Row Hands-on Preview

The new Saints Row feels a lot like a game from a different era, but with a bunch of additions that make it more than just a nostalgic return to the past.

We played about four hours of Saints Row at a recent preview event, which encompassed the beginning of the game. As with the original Saints Row, the new game is all about creating your own criminal empire--but you have a long way to go before that happens. It's set in the new city of Santo Ileso, a fictional location in the United States' Southwest that mixes an urban center, suburbs, and desert locations, and carries the vibe of places such as Las Vegas or Albequrque, without being quite like either.
 
Though we know you're eventually going to become a crime kingpin, the game starts with your humble beginnings, when your character is living in a dingy apartment with three friends: mechanic and driving wiz Neenah, entrepreneurial expert Eli, and shirtless DJ and resident cook Kev. Everyone in the group is familiar with petty crime, and both Neenah and Kev are members of local gangs. Neenah's with Los Panteros, a gang that's focused on cars and weight-lifting, while Kev hangs around with the Idols, a band of techno-anarchists who believe in a decentralized future. You're a member of the third "gang" in town, and the only legitimate one: a private military corporation called Marshall Defense Industries.

So at the start of Saints Row, your goal is to climb the corporate ladder as a mercenary at Marshall, mostly focused on bringing home enough rent money to keep you and your friends from eviction. Trying to find a way to "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" and fight an economic system stacked against you is a pretty pervasive theme in Saints Row--at one point, Neenah mentions the driving force for her doing crimes is to earn money to pay off her student loans. Your character is already a talented killer full of bravado, so the opportunity to earn bonus pay for performing well incentivizes you to become a one-person maverick murder machine.

## Minecraft Takes Stance On NFTs | GameSpot News

Mojang reveals if NFTs will have a place in Minecraft, Xbox adds Discord support and class changes are coming to Diablo Immortal.
#GamingNews #Minecraft #Xbox 

As Mojang explains in a new blog post, allowing server owners to implement NFT integration and "play to earn" features – which could reward players with NFT forms of in-game skins and items – would take "the focus away from playing the game" and allow for "profiteering." The crux of the matter comes down to the fact that allowing players to earn NFT rewards would create an ecosystem of "haves and have-nots," which goes against Minecraft's values of "inclusion and playing together." Mojang goes as far to call NFTs against the "spirit of Minecraft."

Xbox is finally introducing built-in Discord support! Later today, select Xbox Insiders will be able to try out the integration while everyone else will have to wait for the support to expand in the coming weeks. This new feature seems to only support voice chat and not Discord’s text based communication. There is also no dedicated app on Xbox yet so make sure you have your mobile device ready because you’ll need it to transfer the audio over to the console using the new “Join on Xbox”. Once you’re in a call thats been transferred over, you'll be able to see who's on call with you, and who's speaking, the same as if you're using Discord on mobile or PC. And you'll be able to adjust the sound, as well as switch between Discord Voice and Xbox game chat.

Following a new update, players will be able to convert their current character into a new class every seven days at no cost. The swap can be made at the new Shifting Flames brazier in Westmarch and players will have the option of immediately reverting back to that character's previous class should they decide they made a mistake.

## What Made Niko Bellic a Great Character

Niko Bellic is a horrible human, but he’s also a great character. In this video, DeVante breaks down what makes Niko so good even in a post-GTA 5 world.
#Gaming #GTA #grandtheftauto 

The poor guy was on a steady losing streak that didn’t get much better after the war. Unable to find a job, Niko fell into human trafficking work in order to get by.

And I know, only monsters would smuggle and sell other human beings, so that last part may not seem like it's helping me sell him as a great character. But stick with me because I believe it's deep flaws like that one that help make him believable. We’ll get to that in a second.

Following a botched smuggling run, Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Russian crime boss Ray Bulgarin. This in turn led to his decision to head to America where he thought he could start fresh with his wealthy cousin Roman. In reality, Roman was broker than the district he lived in, and America proved to be just as crime infested as other places in the world.

Niko played the cards he was dealt, tried to reshuffle, but ended up with the same hand in a new city. Rockstar made a deeply flawed character with a troubled past and made me believe that he was a guy down on his luck looking for a change. I wanted so badly for him to have at least one win, even if he technically didn’t deserve it. Because deep down we all want to believe in second chances.

Unfortunately for Niko, that second chance was harder to achieve thanks to three of his key motivating factors: money, family / loyalty and revenge. Each time Niko accepts a new mission throughout the story, one or more of these factors lie behind his decision to say yes. And just like his flaws that I hinted at earlier, knowing Niko’s ‘Why’ is another way Rockstar makes him believable.
