The war in Ukraine is terrible for a lot of reasons, but maybe the biggest is the disruption the war is causing on food production around the world. Ukraine has often been called "The Breadbasket of Europe" because of its fertile soil that produces massive amounts of wheat, corn, and other grains. In this video, we take a look at why Ukraine's geology makes them the breadbasket they are, and how the current war will impact the millions of people who rely on that food.
