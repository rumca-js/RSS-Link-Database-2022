  <p id="8zmzJt">Back in 2018 I managed to nab a physical <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box">Steam Link</a> when Valve was flogging them for £2.50 here in the UK ($2.50 in USD). I was actually buying a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">Steam Controller</a> for my then-partner and spotted the bargain while browsing through the Steam website, so I purchased the gadget on a whim. That little black puck has since left such a good impression on me that every alternative service has paled in comparison.</p>
<p id="z1kPm9">The Steam Link is fairly straightforward. It’s a wireless box-shaped dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port, allowing you to stream games directly from your PC over your home internet connection. I had great success using it over Wi-fi, seeing barely any detectable lag, but you could also connect the device directly to your network...</p>

## What keeping a bullet journal taught me about using to-do list apps

  <p id="V7LlNO">On July 6th of this year, I officially ended my three-year-long experiment with trying to organize my life using a physical bullet journal. I know the exact date because I’m looking at my discontinued notebook as I write this. Apparently, five months ago, I needed to take photos of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23274022/corsair-k70-pro-mini-wireless-review-60-percent-gaming-mechanical-keyboard">Corsair K70 keyboard</a> for a then-forthcoming review and follow up with a quote I’d received to insulate my roof. I took the photos. I did not end up insulating my roof. </p>
<p id="IYsvN8">Since then, I’ve used the notebook for jotting down things to remember here and there, but when it comes to keeping track of daily tasks and chores, I’ve switched back to the same hodgepodge of different note-taking and to-do list apps that I used three years ago. These include Notion for...</p>

## Playing Metroid Prime on a Steam Deck shouldn’t feel this good

  <p id="tdav9f">If there were gamer commandments, not expecting too much out of Nintendo would probably be chiseled onto it. Still, I was hopeful that on November 18th, it would surprise launch a Switch version of the <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>. Nintendo did no such thing on that day, the 20th birthday of <em>Metroid Prime</em>, the timeless modernization of the series that turned it into a first-person shooter. I didn’t let that get me down. After all, I own a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">Steam Deck</a>, which seems to be as good at emulating non-PC games as it is at playing many PC titles. </p>
<p id="DkKmLT">Getting the three-game collection made for the Wii running on the Steam Deck was a surprisingly easy and fast process, and it requires very little experience dealing with emulators. Not to mention, it’s...</p>

## Why scientists laid ‘murder’ to rest

  <p id="1krFYX">What’s in an insect name? If that name happens to be “<a href="https://entsoc.org/news/press-releases/northern-giant-hornet-common-name-vespa-mandarinia">murder hornet</a>” or “<a href="https://entsoc.org/news/press-releases/spongy-moth-approved-new-common-name-lymantria-dispar">gypsy moth</a>,” the moniker happens to be loaded with<strong> </strong>misinformation and / or prejudice. That’s why the Entomological Society of America (ESA) has axed both names — and more changes are likely on the way.</p>
<p id="kfbldC">The ESA has a <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/publications/common-names/better-common-names-project">project</a> called Better Common Names that aims to put an end to insect names that might be harmful to people. This year, the group announced that it adopted the name “northern giant hornet,” refusing to accept popular colloquial titles for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499897/murder-hornet-sightings-2022-washington-state">invasive</a> insect. It also changed “gypsy moth” to “spongy moth.” They’re also on the lookout for other names that need changing. Just about anybody can fill out a <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/f964411fb38d4372915af32e32aec161">form</a>, and the ESA will consider the proposal along...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KJ21VS">By virtue of its incredible Game Pass library, the Xbox is one of the best values in gaming right now. Pay a monthly subscription fee — anywhere from $10 a month for the base plan up to $15 a month for the ultimate tier that includes online multiplayer — and get access to a library of games that you can play at no additional charge. </p>
<p id="yNAE8T">A lot of the available games are brand-new Xbox exclusives or games that have been around for a while and are just making their way to Game Pass. But with 400-plus games to choose from, it can get a little daunting to figure out the ones that are worth your time — especially as time is at a premium during the holidays.</p>
