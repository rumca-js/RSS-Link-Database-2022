Everyone\u2019s a winner! </p><p>Welcome to the resistance! Perhaps we ought not to look primarily to fantasy shows on streaming services for tips on how to combat authoritarianism, but you take what you can get. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/22/andor-how-a-star-wars-deep-cut-became-one-of-the-best-tv-shows-of-the-year\">Andor</a> on Disney+, with its comprehensive guide to grassroots rebellion in the Star Wars universe, now The Witcher: Blood Origin (Netflix) maps out how to fight back when The Man has pointy ears.</p><p>For this prequel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/27/the-witcher-netflix-games-of-thrones\">The Witcher</a>, we go back, back, back to 1,200 years before the time of Geralt of Rivia \u2013 and if you don\u2019t know who that is, it matters not. Slide right into the self-contained story of a continent where elves, dwarves and other often-warring peoples are living in uneasy proximity, until the arrival of one vicious dictatorship to rule them all makes everyone even less relaxed. Out in the sticks, soldier turned travelling bard \u00c9ile (Sophia Brown) is already fomenting revolutionary solidarity by singing rousing folk songs in pubs \u2013 and, in her introductory scene, taking care of drunk punters who get aggressively handsy with a waitress, by stabbing them in the legs and smashing their faces on tables, before continuing to play her bowed zither thingy and sing about people power. We like her immediately.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/25/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-review-this-profanity-packed-fantasy-is-a-riot\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/china-stops-publishing-daily-covid-figures-amid-reports-of-explosion-in-cases", "title": "China stops publishing daily Covid figures amid reports of explosion in cases", "date_published": "2022-12-25 05:24:50+00:00", "description": "<p>The National Health Commission\u2019s decision comes as the country\u2019s health system faces enormous strain after the sudden end to the zero-Covid policy</p><p>China\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC) has stopped publishing daily Covid-19 data, amid concerns about the reliability of the figures after infections exploded in the wake of an abrupt easing of tough restrictions.</p><p>\u201cRelevant Covid information will be published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for reference and research,\u201d the commission said in a statement, without specifying the reasons for the change or how frequently China CDC will update the public with new Covid information.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/china-stops-publishing-daily-covid-figures-amid-reports-of-explosion-in-cases\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/pope-condemns-power-hungry-and-alludes-to-ukraine-conflict-in-christmas-eve-mass", "title": "Pope condemns power hungry and alludes to Ukraine conflict in Christmas Eve mass", "date_published": "2022-12-25 01:39:06+00:00", "description": "<p>7,000 people fill St. Peter\u2019s Basilica after several years of Covid imposed restrictions on attendance</p><p>Pope Francis warned in a solemn Christmas Eve Mass that the level of greed and hunger for power was such that some wanted to \u201cconsume even their neighbours\u201d, in an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Francis, celebrating the 10th Christmas of his pontificate, presided over a capacity crowd of about 7,000 in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica after several years of restricted attendance because of Covid.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/pope-condemns-power-hungry-and-alludes-to-ukraine-conflict-in-christmas-eve-mass\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/25/boxing-day-test-victorian-fast-bowler-scott-boland-retains-spot-over-hazlewood", "title": "Boxing Day Test: Victorian fast bowler Scott Boland retains spot over Hazlewood", "date_published": "2022-12-25 00:46:51+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Victorian quick will return to the scene of his famous Test debut last December</li><li>Boland has taken 25 wickets in his five Tests</li></ul><p>Boxing Day Test hero Scott Boland has retained his spot in Australia\u2019s star bowling attack and will line up at the MCG against South Africa.</p><p>The Victorian quick will return to the scene of his famous Test debut last December, with Australia selectors opting for Boland over Josh Hazlewood, who continues his recovery from a side strain.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/25/boxing-day-test-victorian-fast-bowler-scott-boland-retains-spot-over-hazlewood\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-305-of-the-invasion", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 305 of the invasion", "date_published": "2022-12-25 00:45:19+00:00", "description": "<p>Ten dead and more than 50 injured in Russian strikes on Kherson; \u2018We will endure this winter,\u2019 Volodymyr Zelenskiy says in Christmas eve message</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p>At least ten people were killed and an estimated 58 wounded on Saturday in Russian shelling on the recently recaptured Ukrainian city of <strong>Kherson</strong>.
