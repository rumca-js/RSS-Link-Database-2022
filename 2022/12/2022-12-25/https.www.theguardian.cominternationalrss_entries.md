<ul><li>Updates as the three-Test series continues at the MCG</li><li>Start time in Melbourne is 10:30am/11:30pm GMT</li><li>Any thoughts? <a href="mailto:geoff.lemon@theguardian.com">Email Geoff</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport">@GeoffLemonSport</a></li></ul><p>That’s interesting. The pitch is nowhere near as green as Brisbane, but it does look grassy enough from a distance, that kind of patchy grass that has characterised the surface over the last few years. It’s also fairly cool and a bit cloudy right at the moment, mid 20s with a forecast high later of 32, and forecast to be sunny and in the high 30s tomorrow, so maybe Pat Cummins thinks that the bowling conditions will be easier to handle and will hope to be batting by the time it gets hot.</p><p>And why not a potentially soon-to-be-redundant argument for David Warner at the top of the order? Another couple of low scores might throw this out the window, but I’m thinking that patience is the right way to go when a player’s record is this good. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/dec/26/australia-vs-south-africa-cricket-live-updates-score-second-test-boxing-day-one-latest-scores-aus-v-sa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Six months on, is something positive coming from the killings that shocked the world?</p><p>Sunday 5 June started peacefully for Dom Phillips. The British journalist was in the rainforest on a reporting trip for his book, How to Save the Amazon. Just after dawn he got in a small launch with his friend and guide, Bruno Pereira, and they travelled up the Itaquaí River, only the sound of the birds and the motor breaking the comforting silence. But then they were ambushed and both men were shot dead. The killers, angry at Pereira for trying to stop their illegal fishing racket, dragged their bodies into the forest and buried them.</p><p>The murders hit headlines around the world and shone a light on a region where violence has soared since rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took power on 1 January 2019. After a slow response, Brazilian police, with the considerable assistance of the Indigenous local people, took action and three people are in jail awaiting trial for the killings. Another man identified as the possible intellectual author of the crime was released from custody in October and is under house arrest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/25/murders-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-brazil-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Biden administration is developing a controversial solar geoengineering research plan to the dismay of many experts</p><p>As global heating escalates, the US government has set out a plan to further study the controversial and seemingly sci-fi notion of deflecting the sun’s rays before they hit Earth. But a growing group of scientists denounces any steps towards what is known as solar geoengineering.</p><p>The White House has set into motion a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/legal/">five-year outline for research</a> into “climate interventions”.

<p>The nation has been rattled by economic crisis, political upheaval and corruption, but many believe the dessert-making custom could spark joy in these bleak times</p><p>As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home.</p><p>Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as <em>puhul dosi</em>), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/25/christmas-cake-traditional-sri-lankan-treat-uniting-island-diaspora">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How did The Bear – a small, indie-feeling series about a top chef who returns home to save the family business – become such a TV sensation? We unravel a story of chaos, obsession and thinly-sliced beef</p><p>When The Bear appeared on screens in the US this year, it arrived with few expectations. A small, indie-feeling drama about an ailing Chicago sandwich shop, it came with a semi-recognisable cast and a creator best known for directing standup specials. Three months later, when it debuted in the UK, the buzz was palpable. And now? The consensus is that it might be the best workplace drama since Mad Men.</p><p>The story of Carmy Berzatto, a celebrated chef who returns home to save the family business after the suicide of his brother, The Bear arrives at a gallop and never lets up. There’s obsession. There’s chaos. There is an episode delivered in a single breathless shot. The Bear has been such a sensation that media coverage has long since crept out from the television pages. We’ve seen articles about the food, the music, even Berzatto’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/oct/14/real-star-the-bear-carmy-perfect-white-t-shirt" title="">favourite brand of T-shirt</a>. It has been called the sexiest show of the year and the most stressful. In an age dominated by spin-offs, knock-offs and prequels, people have taken to this wildly original series like it’s a long lost relative. And the show’s cast is as surprised as anyone by its success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/25/the-bear-jeremy-allen-white-best-workplace-drama-since-mad-men">Continue reading...</a>

Murphy, 33, was among the generations of children taken by their parents to Dennis Photofinish studio at the corner of St Bernard Avenue and North Tonti Street in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a>’s majority-Black Seventh Ward <strong> </strong>neighborhood to have their portrait taken with the man countless folks in the city simply knew affectionately by his <a href="https://obits.nola.com/us/obituaries/nola/name/fred-parker-obituary?id=2268891">preferred nickname</a>: “Chocolate Santa”.</p><p>Chocolate Santa for most of the year was school bus driver Fred Parker. But when the holidays rolled around, Parker transformed into Chocolate – or Seventh Ward – Santa, complete with the traditional red suit and hat. He sat patiently listening to wishes for toys and other Christmas miracles at the portrait studio or at the schools, daycares, hospitals, markets and malls he visited during “the most wonderful time of the year” for nearly five decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/25/chocolate-santa-new-orleans">Continue reading...</a>

He described it as a “small family legend”.

<p>Extremely bad-ass fights and hilariously playful swearing make this drama lots of fun – plus it’s only four episodes long. Everyone’s a winner! </p><p>Welcome to the resistance! Perhaps we ought not to look primarily to fantasy shows on streaming services for tips on how to combat authoritarianism, but you take what you can get. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/22/andor-how-a-star-wars-deep-cut-became-one-of-the-best-tv-shows-of-the-year">Andor</a> on Disney+, with its comprehensive guide to grassroots rebellion in the Star Wars universe, now The Witcher: Blood Origin (Netflix) maps out how to fight back when The Man has pointy ears.</p><p>For this prequel to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/27/the-witcher-netflix-games-of-thrones">The Witcher</a>, we go back, back, back to 1,200 years before the time of Geralt of Rivia – and if you don’t know who that is, it matters not. Slide right into the self-contained story of a continent where elves, dwarves and other often-warring peoples are living in uneasy proximity, until the arrival of one vicious dictatorship to rule them all makes everyone even less relaxed. Out in the sticks, soldier turned travelling bard Éile (Sophia Brown) is already fomenting revolutionary solidarity by singing rousing folk songs in pubs – and, in her introductory scene, taking care of drunk punters who get aggressively handsy with a waitress, by stabbing them in the legs and smashing their faces on tables, before continuing to play her bowed zither thingy and sing about people power. We like her immediately.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/25/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-review-this-profanity-packed-fantasy-is-a-riot">Continue reading...</a>
