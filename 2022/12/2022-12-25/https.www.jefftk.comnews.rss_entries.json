The problem is she's a professional\nsinger performing a piece she knows well, while we're a\ncrowd of amateurs most of who haven't heard the song before let\nalone sung it.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSome aspects of the song that make it tricky to pick up on the fly:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Most of the words are pickups.\n\n</li>\n<li>The lines don't start on a consistent beat.\n\n</li>\n<li>Sections have small differences each time they're repeated.\n\n</li>\n<li>It's not square.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAdditionally, the sung portion ends with a build and the song's\nconclusion is instrumental, which is not satisfying for group singing.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAlex and I made some changes to get it to work better in our context,\nand while they make it a worse performance song I think they're a good\ncompromise for group singing that keeps a lot of what makes the song\nworth singing.  Here are the words and chords we figured out:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<pre>\n        G\nso come out.\n                   G\nbeen waiting long enough.\n                         C                                       G\nyou're done with all the talk talk talk with nothing on the table.\n                     G\nit's time to come on out.\n              G\nno sign from above.\n                     C                                            G\nyou'll only hear the knock knock knock of your own heart as signal.\n\n\n           Em      D    C\nif you are afraid, come forth.\n            Em    D    C\nif you are alone, come forth now.\n          Em   D   C     Bm  D\neverybody here has loved and lost,\n                              G\n[pause] so level up and love again.\n\n\n       G\nbegin again.\n                     G\nblast the dam on the flow.\n                    C                                   G\nyour body feels the tock tock tock of time as it hammers.\n                G\nlord we are all cinders\n                  G\nfrom a fire long ago,\n                   C                                               G\nbut here it is the knock knock knock of your own heart that matters.\n\n\n           Em      D    C\nif you are afraid, come forth.\n            Em    D    C\nif you are alone, come forth now.\n          Em   D   C     Bm   D\neverybody here has seams and scars,\n                              G\n[pause] so level up and feel again.\n\n\n            C   D  G\nand this is all we need.\n            C     D   G\nand this is where we start.\n            C   D  G\nthis is the day we greet.\n            C    D  G\nthis is the day, no other.\n\n\n                     G\ncall it any name you need.\n                     G\ncall it any name you feel.\n             C                          G\ncall it your 2.0, your rebirth, whatever.\n                   G\nif you can feel it all,\n                      G\nwith your doors flung wide.\n             C                               G\ncall it your day no. 1 in the rest of forever.\n\n\n            Em     D    C\nif you are afraid, give more.\n            Em    D    C\nif you are alive, give more now.\n          Em   D   C     Bm   D\neverybody here has seams and scars.\n                              G\n[pause] so level up and live again.\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nHere's a rough recording of how we did it at our gathering.  Note that\nthe accompanist (me...) is rushing, and the initial tempo (85-90bpm) is\na good speed.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-09-levelup.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-09-levelup.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI got a lot of very positive feedback on this song, and I think it was\npeople's favorite from the evening.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSince making that recording I've tweaked the chorus not to use \"love\"\nevery time, with \"feel\" and \"live\" on later times through.  So many\nsongs are about love, and while this song does cover love it covers a\nwider range of human experience and it's better if the chorus\nreflects that.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe place where I'm least happy with this adaptation is that it drops\nthe slow first half of the bridge:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nlet your faith die.\nbring your wonder.\nyes, you are only one.\nno, it is not enough\nbut if you lift your eyes, I am your brother.\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThese are great words, but the way the original song places them,\nespecially the first two lines with one hard-to-predict note on each,\nwouldn't work in this context.  If anyone has ideas on how to fit this\nin without making the song much harder to sing along to on the fly\nI'd love to hear it!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02DKxfauS6thPkJZCXfsmv29HjCs2c1UyfoUTdivv4XdBhtMEtXjS9xktDHH5KLm4dl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109574415998111875\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/simplified-level-up", "date_published": "2022-12-25 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
