I was actually buying a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price\">Steam Controller</a> for my then-partner and spotted the bargain while browsing through the Steam website, so I purchased the gadget on a whim. That little black puck has since left such a good impression on me that every alternative service has paled in comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"z1kPm9\">The Steam Link is fairly straightforward. It\u2019s a wireless box-shaped dongle that plugs into your TV\u2019s HDMI port, allowing you to stream games directly from your PC over your home internet connection.

I know the exact date because I\u2019m looking at my discontinued notebook as I write this. Apparently, five months ago, I needed to take photos of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23274022/corsair-k70-pro-mini-wireless-review-60-percent-gaming-mechanical-keyboard\">Corsair K70 keyboard</a> for a then-forthcoming review and follow up with a quote I\u2019d received to insulate my roof. I took the photos. I did not end up insulating my roof. </p>\n<p id=\"IYsvN8\">Since then, I\u2019ve used the notebook for jotting down things to remember here and there, but when it comes to keeping track of daily tasks and chores, I\u2019ve switched back to the same hodgepodge of different note-taking and to-do list apps that I used three years ago.

Still, I was hopeful that on November 18th, it would surprise launch a Switch version of the <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>. Nintendo did no such thing on that day, the 20th birthday of <em>Metroid Prime</em>, the timeless modernization of the series that turned it into a first-person shooter. I didn\u2019t let that get me down. After all, I own a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">Steam Deck</a>, which seems to be as good at emulating non-PC games as it is at playing many PC titles. </p>\n<p id=\"DkKmLT\">Getting the three-game collection made for the Wii running on the Steam Deck was a surprisingly easy and fast process, and it requires very little experience dealing with emulators.
