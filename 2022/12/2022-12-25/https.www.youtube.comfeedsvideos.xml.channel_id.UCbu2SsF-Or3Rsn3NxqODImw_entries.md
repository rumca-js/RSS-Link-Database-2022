From Medal of Honor and Max Payne, to Saving Private Ryan and John Wick, the Colt 1911 is a pistol with over 100 years of service, a veteran of two world wars, and a weapon that boasts some of the most iconic appearances in movies, TV and video games.

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk through the history of the 1911, from its invention through to the modern day, and break down the legacy of this century-old handgun, as an iconic weapon in both reality and in our video games.
