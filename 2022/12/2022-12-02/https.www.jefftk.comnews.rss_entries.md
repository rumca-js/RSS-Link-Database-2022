<a href="https://juliawise.net/">Julia</a> and I usually decide on our
annual giving at the end of each year.  For the past few years this
has been relatively straightforward: I was paid 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/money">a
lot</a>, so we 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/donations">donated 50%</a>. This year is less
so, because halfway through I 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/leaving-google-joining-the-nucleic-acid-observatory">switched
jobs</a> to work on something directly valuable. While I'm very
excited about the potential of this work, it does pay enough less that
even if we stopped donating we'd be keeping less for ourselves than
before.



<p>

One option we considered was donating 50% of our income from the first
half of the year, up until I switched jobs, and then some smaller
proportion of the income from later in the year, representing about
how much we intend to donate going forward. We thought about this, but
decided not to:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/if-professional-investors-missed-this">collapse
of FTX</a>, taking with it their <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned">philanthropic
arm</a>, means that there is less money available for EA projects,
so it's more valuable to have funding now than in the recent past.

</p></li>
<li><p>We're not sure how to pick an amount for the second half of
the year.  Some of this is not being clear on what sort of donation
norms we'd like to encourage for people working at the kind of
organization they would otherwise be happy to fund, or who take
lower-paying jobs for altruistic reasons. Another part is that what we
personally want to do depends on what the post-FTX funding situation
for our employers end up looking like.

</p></li>
<li><p>I like having a simple explanation for what we're doing with
our money, and while pro-rating isn't that complicated it's still
something I'd rather avoid.  Simplicity is also a reason why we lean
away from donating via <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/mildly-against-donor-lotteries">lottery</a> or <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/passing-up-pay">salary sacrifice</a>.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Instead, we've decided to just continue giving 50% for 2022, and give
some smaller proportion in 2023. How much? Not sure yet.

</p>

<p>

As in past years, we're planning to divide our giving between <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> (evidence-backed public
health interventions, like distribution of antimalarial bed nets) and
the <a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community">EA
Infrastructure Fund</a> (a wide range of projects intended to help the
effective altruism community grow into the best community it can).

</p>

<p>

"Let's just keep doing what we were doing, and decide later what we
want to do later" is not a very satisfying conclusion, but I'm hoping
things are clearer next year.
