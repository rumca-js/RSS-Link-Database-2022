And then to make sure it was really good they spent another 750 million on production. So there you have it. One billion dollars! Instant classic, guaranteed! Right? That\u2019s how it works, right?\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power definitely raises some questions. Like why is Galadriel so invincible and powerful? What were the odds of her stumbling upon Sauron in the middle of the ocean? Was she really just planning on swimming across an ocean to get home? Are volcanic eruptions not a huge deal? What was with that weird Rube Goldberg set-up at Mordor?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nShe-Hulk Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDBd16pBLg\n\nMorbius Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5I1WWeFQg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhsGVs6auq0", "date_published": "2022-12-02 20:15:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
