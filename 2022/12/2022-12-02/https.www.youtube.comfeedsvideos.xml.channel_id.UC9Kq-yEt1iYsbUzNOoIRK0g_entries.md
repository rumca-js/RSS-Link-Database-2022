Amazon Studios decided to step up their game a few years ago by spending something like 250 million dollars on the rights to make a Lord of the Rings TV show. And then to make sure it was really good they spent another 750 million on production. So there you have it. One billion dollars! Instant classic, guaranteed! Right? Thatâ€™s how it works, right?

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power definitely raises some questions. Like why is Galadriel so invincible and powerful? What were the odds of her stumbling upon Sauron in the middle of the ocean? Was she really just planning on swimming across an ocean to get home? Are volcanic eruptions not a huge deal? What was with that weird Rube Goldberg set-up at Mordor?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power!
