Given that BTS\u2019s RM (aka Kim Nam-joon) is based in South Korea, we let it slide \u2014 not least because his team put together one of the most impressive Tiny Desk facsimiles we\u2019ve seen yet. What really sets it apart is the huge array of shelf-bound ephemera, which is bound to have the BTS Army sleuthing in the YouTube comments. What\u2019s a random tchotchke and what\u2019s an Easter egg? Study the set closely!\n\nRM timed his solo Tiny Desk debut \u2014 which follows BTS\u2019s home concert from back in 2020 \u2014 to coincide with the release of his first official studio album, Indigo. But he kicks off the set with an older track, \u201cseoul,\u201d which first appeared on his 2018 mixtape mono. From there, he showcases the first two tracks from Indigo: the rap-driven \u201cYun\u201d and the funky \u201cStill Life,\u201d both of which are inspired by RM\u2019s love of and fascination with painting. The studio tracks feature Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak, respectively, both of whom get shoutouts in this set. But here, the focus never drifts away from the star at center stage \u2014 no matter how closely you might squint at the stuffed animals, housewares, clocks and toys (not to mention Big Mouth Billy Bass!) behind him.\n\nNow, if we can just get him to visit the real Tiny Desk\u2026\n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cseoul\u201d\n\u201cYun\u201d\n\u201cStill Life\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nRM: vocals\nDOCSKIM: keyboard \njohn eun: guitar\nJaeshin Park: bass\nJK Kim: drums\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Oui Kim (OUI)\nProducer: Yeonjin Kim (OUI)\nAUDIO:\nJEONG WOO YEONG\nSon Yu Jeong\n\nCREW:\nHuiwon Song\nSunyoung Kim\nHyeri Shin \nEumKo\nYoungwoo Lee\nEunil Lee\nSungju Min \nKihun Kim \nSeungjong Lee\nYuntae Ko \nKidung Kim\nKiyong Eom\nDonghyun Lee\nDoosoo Choi\nYujin Jung\nSangjoon Lee \nKieun Lee \nKihyun Lee \nSeonghyeon Heo\nInsol Yun\nHyeongeun Kim \nYujin Ko \nDaeun Han\nJae Yoo \nGANi \nLeehyun Kim \nYeonhwa Cha\nDaye Shin\nDaniella Kim\nSaeyong Oh\nLee Jung Min\nLee Hyeon Ki\nJeong Dae Seong\nJinho Jeong\nRachel Um\nJennie Lee\nRosa Kim\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Suraya Mohamed, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Jill Britton, Sofia Seidel\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #rm #bts #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKg3FV5gwMc", "date_published": "2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
