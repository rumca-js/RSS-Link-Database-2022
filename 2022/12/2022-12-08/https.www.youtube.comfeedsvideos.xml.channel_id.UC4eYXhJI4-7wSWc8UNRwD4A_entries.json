Segarra just released HFTRR's eighth album, LIFE ON EARTH, earlier this year, and its songs of survival, community and rediscovery translated to a fiery, inspired set at Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club.\n\nSET LIST:\n\"PIERCED ARROWS\"\n\"RHODODENDRON\"\n\"POINTED AT THE SUN\"\n\"SAGA\"\n\"ROSEMARY TEARS\"\n\nMUSICIANS:\nAlynda Segarra \nHowe Pearson \nMatthew (Skinner) Peterson\nDaniel (Yan) Westerlund\n\nCREDITS:\nProducer: Lia Camille Crockett; Live Video Director: Mito Habe-Evans; Videographers: Tsering Bista, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Nickolai Hammar, Nick Michael, Maia Stern; Video Production Assistants: Sofia Seidel, Christina Shaman; Editor: Nickolai Hammar; Graphics: Alicia Zheng; Associate Producer: Elle Mannion; Events Team: Gianna Capadona, Devon Williams; Senior Streaming Engineer: Bruce Grant; Streaming Engineers: Erin Gannon, Allen Walden; Mastering Engineer; Josh Rogosin; Audio Assistant: Neil Tevault; Front of House at 9:30 Club: Shawn \"Gus\" Vitale; Sr. Director of Events & Experiential: Jessica Goldstein; Stage Manager: Peggy Dahlquist; Rights Clearance Consultant: Jackie Sussman; Emcee/DJ: Bobby \"DJ Cuzzin B\" Carter; Deputy Director, NPR Music: Otis Hart; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins; Special Thanks to: 9:30 Club, WAMU\n\n\n#nprmusic #hurrayfortheriffraff", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u4rXzIw8JE", "date_published": "2022-12-08 14:56:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
