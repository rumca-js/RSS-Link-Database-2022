After 40 or more years, it might be safe to assume that all versions and imaginations of songs may already have happened. But Anilee, Erin, and Julia put their own spin on this record with a hauntingly beautiful interpretation. It just goes to show that all songs can have new interpretations! There are still so many songs to make Magaziine covers!
