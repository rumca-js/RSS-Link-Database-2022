Electricity got expensive. This is why we need to get the most out of it. Based on measuring the power consumption behavior of our devices, we create a strategy and a setup to get the lowest energy bill without sacrificing the quality of life. In a following video, we will test if we can trust the measurement of our Shellies or Sonoffs using this calibrated power meter.
A rewarding venture. Letâ€™s start!
