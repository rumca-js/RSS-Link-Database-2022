From the classic AK-47 and AKM rifles through to reproductions like the Chinese Type-56, our favourite shooters have featured plenty of the iconic Russian firearm. In this bonus episode of Loadout, Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson breaks down and compares a variety of different AK rifles.

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the iconic AK-47 and its different variants.

According to a Steam page that has since been changed, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will be released in March 2023.
#GamingNews #StarWarsJediSurvivor #TheGameAwards

According to a previous report, Jedi: Survivor's release date is scheduled to be officially announced during The Game Awards this week. A new trailer for the game will also be shown at the event. 

And the potential release date isn’t the only thing that the Steam page revealed, there were also images that showcased the pre-order bonuses for different versions of the game. These items include some new looks for Cal and BD-1, new Lightsabers and possibly the most exciting addition: different Blaster sets. In Jedi: Fallen Order, Cal didn’t have a gun in his loadout, however it looks like this time around that will change. 

Guess we’re just going to have to wait for the Game Awards for confirmation. Lucky for us, Thursday is right around the corner so we won’t have to wait long. On top of that, we won’t have to watch it for very long either as Geoff Keighley has confirmed that The Game Awards 2022 will be much shorter than last year's showcase.

During a recent Twitter Spaces talk, Keighley discussed the upcoming ceremony and answered some questions about what to expect. The Game Awards is usually filled with not only award presentations, but interviews with developers and trailers for brand-new games. Last year's pre-show lasted around 30 minutes while the main event went on for 3 hours. During the Spaces talk Geoff said, "I won't say anything officially until we're through our rehearsals but we think it's going to be significantly shorter."

The Witcher 3 is back with a fresh coat of paint. We had a chance to check it out, and it looks and plays better than ever. Jake and DeVante talk through their thoughts after an extended preview.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt originally came to PC, Xbox One, and PS4 back in 2015. It is widely considering one of the best games of that generation, and now it's getting a next-gen update for PS5 and Xbox Series S|X.

This version adds two modes: Performance and Ray Tracing. Both settings look great, but the Ray Tracing mode utilizes some subtle ray tracing techniques to enhance the visuals even more.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition is out on December 14 as a free upgrade.

The AK-47 is easily both the most famous and infamous firearm in all of the world’s history. With over 100 million made, its appearance in over half a century of cinema, and its place within the hands of players in hundreds of video games, the Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947 is undeniably the most recognisable weapon ever made.

With the help of Jonathan Ferguson, Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries Museum in the UK, we chart the AK-47’s journey, from its post-WW2 creation through to its huge pop culture footprint as the quintessential Hollywood “bad guy gun”.
