To say nothing of the light show, Stromae\u2019s throbbingly impeccable arrangements involve the extensive use of pre-recorded tracks, all of which are frowned upon at the Tiny Desk. So, given a simple three-word assignment (\u201cno preset sounds\u201d), his team set about re-creating Stromae\u2019s music so that it could be performed in real time.\n\nThis involved more gleaming tech than we could have ever imagined when we launched Tiny Desk concerts nearly 15 years ago \u2014 veritable banks of laptops, mixers and synthesizers, with multiple producers working out of frame \u2014 but damned if every sound in this set wasn\u2019t crafted and played live on the spot. Stromae and his team had to come a day early for hours of setup and rehearsals, and even the band\u2019s clothing was handpicked from the singer\u2019s fashion line, but what they produced felt loose-limbed and organic in the spirit of the series.\n\nIt helps that, as heard on this year\u2019s outstanding Multitude, Stromae\u2019s songs draw from a deep well of lived emotion. Backed by three members of the Bulgarian women\u2019s choir Yasna Voices, Stromae kicked off his set with \u201cL\u2019enfer,\u201d a wrenching acknowledgement of suicidal thoughts. The song\u2019s chorus, translated to English, reads, \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts and I\u2019m not proud of it / Sometimes you feel it\u2019d be the only way to silence them / All these thoughts putting me through hell.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Stromae\u2019s song selections conveyed lighter moods, but even his most danceable tracks contain undercurrents of darkness and conflict: \u201cSant\u00e9\u201d is a toast to those who can\u2019t celebrate, \u201cAlors on danse\u201d (from 2009\u2019s Cheese) embraces dancing as a way to drown out life\u2019s hardships and \u201cMon amour\u201d attempts to reassure a lover against a backdrop of infidelity and dysfunction. On its own, each track is a heady cocktail of painstaking craft and hard-won joy. Taken together, they form a portrait of a world-class showman at the height of his powers.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cL\u2019enfer\u201d\n\u201cSant\u00e9\u201d\n\u201cAlors on danse\u201d\n\u201cMon amour\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nStromae: vocals\nManoli Avgoustinatos: keyboards, charango, vocals\nYoshi Masuda: keyboard, vocals\nSimon LeSaint: drums, vocals\nFlorian Rossi: keyboard, vocals\n\nYasna Voices NY Bulgarian Women\u2019s Choir, directed by Vlada Tomova\nMimi Berkova\nLarkin Grimm\nVlada Tomova\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Pierre Kattar, Sofia Seidel\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Kara Frame, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#stromae #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dkDepLX0rk", "date_published": "2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
