Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:07 Interview #1 - Explain the missing $8 Billion\n1:58 Sam explains the \"accounting error\"\n2:58 Sam Claimed He Couldn't See $8 Billion\n3:24 Sam Agrees\n3:35 Sam's Employees Laughed at His Explanation\n4.29 \"I had a lot going on\"\n4:52 I interrupt Sam\n5:25 \"I was vaguely aware some of these systems existed\"\n5:50 Sam tells the interviewer he has to leave\n6:02 Interview #2 - Sam's Terms of Service\n7:00 \"My memory is that it was more than a billion\"\n8:20 Sam's Story Isn't Consistent with Insiders\n9:33 \"I'm saying what I believe\"\n9:45 Why do people in your company know more than you?\n9:53 I don't know what they said\n10:07 I'm telling you what they said\n10:34 Alot of the position did not appear\n10:40 So where was the position\n10:55 Who controlled the Secret Stub Account?\n11:04 Are we supposed to believe nobody knew about it?\n11:16 Somebody had to lose the money\n11:22 Seems really convenient...
