This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.

10:34 Alot of the position did not appear
10:40 So where was the position
10:55 Who controlled the Secret Stub Account?

11:16 Somebody had to lose the money
11:22 Seems really convenient... Yeah I don't know what to tell you

11:58 Sam hasn't seen the article

16:27 Sam acknowledges he wrong.. "Massively misjudged"
17:02 What do you mean? No way you make a simple mistake like that
17:22 Pretty big misjudgement I made
18:26 Makes no sense even without a market crash
18:52 The answer seems to always be "I made an embarrassing mistake"

22:35 He was the chief guy, he should've caught this stuff..
23:48 Why'd you choose him specifically?
24:28 Not a failure of regulation
26:18 Sam leaves the call
