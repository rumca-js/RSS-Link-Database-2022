A new trailer for the game will also be shown at the event. \n\nAnd the potential release date isn\u2019t the only thing that the Steam page revealed, there were also images that showcased the pre-order bonuses for different versions of the game. These items include some new looks for Cal and BD-1, new Lightsabers and possibly the most exciting addition: different Blaster sets. In Jedi: Fallen Order, Cal didn\u2019t have a gun in his loadout, however it looks like this time around that will change. \n\nGuess we\u2019re just going to have to wait for the Game Awards for confirmation. Lucky for us, Thursday is right around the corner so we won\u2019t have to wait long. On top of that, we won\u2019t have to watch it for very long either as Geoff Keighley has confirmed that The Game Awards 2022 will be much shorter than last year's showcase.\n\nDuring a recent Twitter Spaces talk, Keighley discussed the upcoming ceremony and answered some questions about what to expect. The Game Awards is usually filled with not only award presentations, but interviews with developers and trailers for brand-new games. Last year's pre-show lasted around 30 minutes while the main event went on for 3 hours. During the Spaces talk Geoff said, \"I won't say anything officially until we're through our rehearsals but we think it's going to be significantly shorter.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1aJJyopODs", "date_published": "2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3 PS4 vs PS5 Next Gen Update", "description": "Here's side-by-side gameplay of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt running on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 with ray tracing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLbOS0ExQU", "date_published": "2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3's Next Gen Upgrade Looks Incredible", "description": "The Witcher 3 is back with a fresh coat of paint.
