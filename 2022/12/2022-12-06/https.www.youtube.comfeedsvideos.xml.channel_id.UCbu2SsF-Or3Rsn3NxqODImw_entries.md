Diablo 4 is quick to differentiate itself from its predecessors in almost every way, while intelligently iterating on new series staples with ideas that put freedom of play at the center.
#gaming #Diablo4 #gamespot #TheGameAwards 

From the moment I took my first steps onto the frigid mountaintops outside the city of Kyovashad in Diablo IV, it was clear that Blizzard was serious about responding to some of the complaints of Diablo III. While Diablo III contrasted pops of bright colors against the grotesque horrors of the world, Diablo IV is immediately more oppressive and dire in its presentation. Its hues are muted and gray, its world uninviting and harsh, its stories seemingly primed to expose the worst parts of its characters. And yet, it doesn't seek to leave everything of its former entry behind. In many ways, this early slice of Diablo IV offered a good sense of how most of the mechanical changes introduced in Diablo III, and more recently Diablo Immortal, have been smartly iterated on to maintain exciting action with the satisfaction of flexible character construction.  
 
Atmosphere is just one facet where Diablo IV is immediately distinct from the series' previous entry.  I's approach to class builds was divisive, with the far more streamlined approach to ability choices stifling creativity in some cases. Diablo IV rectifies this in some smart ways, while still retaining approachability. The skill tree is made up of distinct nodes, with each one splintering outwards with numerous abilities and associated upgrades. Investing points anywhere in the skill tree works towards unlocking the next node and more abilities, giving you flexibility in how you reach each one. Each node usually offers options for a variety of builds specific to your class. For my Sorceress, each node usually featured a new ability for Frost, Fire, or Lightning builds, with ones further down sometimes swapping out options for one element for passive abilities instead. I was limited to just the first 25 levels in this version of the game (the final release will have a level cap of 100), but even with that limitation I found myself constantly looking to find ways to refine my skill choices between tough fights. 
 
Being able to easily respec is core to the freedom that Diablo IV is designed to give players. At any point you can choose to use gold to refund points spent on a specific ability, or redo your skill tree entirely. There's no special merchant you need to visit, or scarce resources you need to gather. While the cost is still being iterated on, game director Joe Shely explained in an interview that this decision was made to encourage players to personalize their builds throughout their time with the game. 
 
It's easy to think of this system as an intersection of Diablo II and III. While the former offered a detailed way to build some complex classes, it was overly strict with being able to take back early game decisions, limiting you to just a single respec per campaign. Diablo III, conversely, took away most of the choice entirely, handing out abilities linearly and only really allowing you to make some choices (albeit limited ones) near the end of your first campaign. With Diablo IV's approach, you can enjoy experimentation without the fear of looking into choices that might have undesired ramifications hours down the line. I found early on that the combination of Frost spells I had chosen weren't working for strong, single enemies, and it was easy enough to entirely redefine my build after reloading a checkpoint. A few hours later, it was just as easy to switch entirely to a Lightning-based build and experiment with a whole other side of the skill tree, which injected a satisfying new kick into the familiar action role-playing combat that still looks and feels great.

Need for Speed Unbound delights with a vibrant new art style and some exciting arcade racing, but familiar issues are as frustrating as an inopportune oil slick.
#GameSpot #NeedForSpeedUnbound #Review

The first thing that jumps out when starting Need for Speed Unbound is its vibrant art style. At a time when most other racing games are striving for photorealism, EA's latest distinguishes itself from the rest of the grid by adopting a stylized mix between reality and comic books. While its cars land on the side of realism, the characters behind the wheel are cel-shaded and its open world falls somewhere in between the two aesthetics. Vivid graffiti-style flourishes also pop up when you activate nitrous or fly off a ramp, and drifting kicks up colorful tire smoke that looks hand-drawn, with all of these effects punctuating the action with a unique sense of style.

There aren't any modern racing games that look quite like it, yet the rest of Unbound feels like a continuation of 2019's Need for Speed Heat. From the distinction between day and night races to the cat-and-mouse chase that occurs when you have to outrun the cops and make it to a safe house in order to bank your money. Unbound doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel, but what's here maintains the series' recent quality, even if there are some wrong turns along the way.

In this episode, We explain Microsoft’s commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms again as well as Elden Ring and Overwatch 2 patch notes.
#GamingNews #MW2 #Nintendo

Would you play Call of Duty if it was on Switch? Because Microsoft has announced a 10-year commitment that will see the franchise published on Nintendo platforms again if the pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. The deal was announced in a tweet by Phil Spencer, who added that Call of Duty games will also continue to be offered for PC players on Steam simultaneously with Xbox.

Imagine a world where Call of Duty is on Switch and not PlayStation. Scary isn’t it. 

You know what else is scary? Fighting people in Elden Ring’s colosseums. The game’s big update launches today, December 7, and thanks to a full list of patch notes we now know what else it includes. There are multiple new hairstyles for players, general balance tweaks, and a series of bug fixes.

Overwatch 2 season 2 is now live and the biggest change is the new Tank Ramattra. He can morph into two different forms to change his tactics on the fly. Blizzard also changed up the battle pass to make Ramattra easier to unlock, at level 45 of the new battle pass.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is an updated version of the PSP classic - showcasing the story of Zack Fair and a prequel to Final Fantasy VII. Jessica Howard goes over what was updated for this remake of a classic game.
#gaming #gamename #gamespot 

Much like protagonist Zack Fair himself, the story of the self-proclaimed country-boy-turned-SOLDIER-First-Class is not one shrouded in mystery. If you've engaged with Final Fantasy VII or any of its various spin-offs, prequels, remakes, or animated movies, chances are you understand the weight of his legacy--which is, coincidentally, only rivaled by the weight of his sword. However, if you're looking for the definitive way to experience it, look no further than Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion.

A remake of the 2007 PSP exclusive Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core Reunion is a faithful retelling of Zack Fair's story with dramatic visual upgrades, full voice acting, and several quality-of-life changes. Considering the game was already heralded as a fantastic prequel and one of the best titles on PSP, it comes as little surprise that this version is triumphant in making Crisis Core into a modern day must-play for Final Fantasy VII fans. Not only does Crisis Core Reunion port the once fairly difficult-to-find game to several new consoles, allowing for a greater audience to experience the title, it transforms the game from feeling like a smaller, handheld experience into something that can proudly stand beside Final Fantasy VII Remake as a worthy companion.

Elden Ring is getting a new Colosseum update, Cyberpunk 2077’s multiplayer has been canceled, God of War Ragnarok adds a photo mode and Vampire Survivors reveals DLC.
#GamingNews #EldenRing #Cyberpunk2077 

The Colosseum update, which arrives tomorrow December 7, invites players into the colosseums of Limgrave, Leyndell, and Caelid where they can fight in 1v1 duels, as part of a team, or in free-for-all matches. All of this comes to Elden Ring in update 1.08, but the full patch notes haven't been announced yet.

In a new update from developer CD Projekt Red, we’ve learned Cyberpunk 2077’s online mode became a casualty of the game's turbulent release as the studio was forced to focus all of its energy on fixing the game’s many issues.

What that multiplayer game would have looked like remains a mystery, as CD Projekt Red kept details of the project tightly under wraps and seldom spoke of it. Luckily the game’s Phantom Liberty expansion is still on the way for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year as well as a sequel further into the future.  

An update you won’t have to wait for however is the latest for God of War Ragnarok. This update adds a very popular feature for virtual photographers: photo mode. The mode lets players put facial expressions on characters like Kratos, Atreus, and more as well as hide main or side characters, too. What's more, things like field of view, focal length, depth of field, and f-stop can be manipulated. In addition, the photo mode includes film grain and exposure settings to tinker with. There is also the ability to apply borders, logos, and vignettes to any photo.
