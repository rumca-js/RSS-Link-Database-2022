But I don't like that they\ninclude \"attention passengers\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIncluding those words in the audio version I understand: you need to\ncatch peoples attention before you start giving them the information.\nOn a sign, however, it's not adding anything.  What makes it worse\nhere is that the critical information, which direction the arriving\ntrain is traveling, is pushed onto the second screen.  Someone who\ncould have enough time to catch the train if they started hustling\nwhen the announcement first came up, might well not have enough time\nif they need to wait for the second screen about ten seconds later.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis isn't a problem for me anymore, now that I've set up my phone so\nthat <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/low-friction-mbta-predictions\">checking train\narrivals</a> is low-friction but it was minorly frustrating for\nyears.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI suspect all it would take to fix this is editing some tiny file that\nstores the announcement text...\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02eQdQfZWcnXPKB9hRe5fc6RBozBEosNzd3sRgHJxCprF7HUc2A8wN2XTwyGnEQyobl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109469904666826393\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/attention-passengers-not-for-signs", "date_published": "2022-12-06 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
