On the MBTA, when a train is coming you get an announcement like:

</span>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
Attention passengers, the next red line train to Ashmont is now arriving.
</blockquote>



<p>

As with all the announcements, there's a text version:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

I like that they have the signs, both for general accessibility
reasons and because you're often in a place where you can read the
sign but not hear the announcement.  But I don't like that they
include "attention passengers".

</p>

<p>

Including those words in the audio version I understand: you need to
catch peoples attention before you start giving them the information.
On a sign, however, it's not adding anything.  What makes it worse
here is that the critical information, which direction the arriving
train is traveling, is pushed onto the second screen.  Someone who
could have enough time to catch the train if they started hustling
when the announcement first came up, might well not have enough time
if they need to wait for the second screen about ten seconds later.

</p>

<p>

This isn't a problem for me anymore, now that I've set up my phone so
that <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/low-friction-mbta-predictions">checking train
arrivals</a> is low-friction but it was minorly frustrating for
years.

</p>

<p>

I suspect all it would take to fix this is editing some tiny file that
stores the announcement text...
