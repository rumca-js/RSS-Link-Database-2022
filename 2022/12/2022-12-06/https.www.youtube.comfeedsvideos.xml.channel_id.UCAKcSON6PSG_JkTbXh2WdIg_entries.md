Washington D.C. musician Bartees Strange (né Bartees Leon Cox, Jr.) released his debut album Live Forever in 2020, and despite the privations of those early days of the pandemic, saw his career begins its ascent through the innovation of online concerts and Zoom interviews.

In 2022, Bartees Strange released its follow-up, Farm To Table. With touring now an option, Bartees Strange came to the Twin Cities in November to play a sold-out show at the Turf Club in St. Paul. While in town, Bartees and two of his bandmates — Dan Kleederman and Graham Richman — visited The Current studio to play stripped-down versions of songs from Farm To Table.
