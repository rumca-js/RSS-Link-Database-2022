There are some startlingly black animals out there, whether they’re in the deep ocean or in the darkest corners of the rainforest. But humans have created some stunningly black substances too, using science and engineering. So who wins, nature or humans? In this video, I go in search of the blackest black things on Earth to see what’s really the blackest… and why.
