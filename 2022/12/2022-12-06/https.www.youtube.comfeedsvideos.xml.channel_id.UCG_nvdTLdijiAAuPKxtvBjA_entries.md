Black Adam is the newest superhero origin story in the DC cinematic universe, starring the Rock. It should've been a massive success because it has the Rock as well as the backing of the Snyderverse fandom, especially due to Henry Cavill's return as Superman. And yet still, it ended up flopping in theaters in terms of the box office. One big reason for that being that it's an origin movie that doesn't work as an origin movie. So in today's episode of Anatomy of a Failure, let's try to find the key origin pitfalls Black Adam falls into so that we can avoid them in the future.

Black Adam (2022)
From New Line Cinema, Dwayne The Rock Johnson stars in the action adventure “Black Adam.” The first-ever feature film to explore the story of the DC Super Hero comes to the big screen under the direction of Jaume Collet-Serra (“Jungle Cruise”). In ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed and Black Adam has gone from man, to myth, to legend. Now released, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone. Johnson stars alongside Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi, Marwan Kenzari, Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone, Mo Amer, Bodhi Sabongui, and Pierce Brosnan (the “Mamma Mia!” and James Bond franchises) as Dr. Fate.
