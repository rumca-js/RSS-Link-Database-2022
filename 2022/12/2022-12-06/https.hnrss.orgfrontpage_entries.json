While freemium might make more sense, this was quicker to release, since in-app-purchases in RN is not trivial. First app I created that's not free, so that's an experiment too. \n- There are no online features, all is stored on the device.<p>Looking to validate with UX designers, but all feedback is welcome.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33878873\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33878873</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.tinyux.app/", "date_published": "2022-12-06 12:53:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Want Your Country to Thrive?

I am sending to businesses & agents with posted job openings, so, it's not unsolicited. I expected a high number of no responses, but > 90% is much higher than I expected(before the latest layoffs trend, anyway).<p>Is such an address likely to go straight to spam or is there a general dislike for Proton Mail I am not aware of? I understand 'free' emails are often abused by bad actors, but I presumed that Proton Mail would be less maligned than most.
