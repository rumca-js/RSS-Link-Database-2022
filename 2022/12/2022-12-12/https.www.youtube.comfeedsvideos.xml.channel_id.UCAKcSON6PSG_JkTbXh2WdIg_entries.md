Utah indie-rock band the Backseat Lovers are early in their career, but they’ve already signed to Capitol Records, and their latest album, "Waiting To Spill," was produced by six-time Grammy Award-winning producer David Greenbaum.

While in town for a show at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, the Backseat Lovers stopped at The Current to perform a set of songs and to talk with host Ayisha Jaffer about what it was like to work with Greenbaum. They also shed some light on the slightly under-the-radar music scene in the state of Utah, and they talk about how they work to connect with the communities where they perform by donating to local nonprofits.

Watch the complete session above.
