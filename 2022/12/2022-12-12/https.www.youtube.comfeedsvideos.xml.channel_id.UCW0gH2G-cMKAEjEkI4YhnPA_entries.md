We chat with Rob Alderman of Games Workshop - creators of The Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game and Warhammer!  We'll talk about the challenges of adapting Tolkien for tabletop gaming, expanding into lesser-known realms like Harad and Rh√ªn, and some of the brand new releases (like the mighty ELROND and the Battle of Osgiliath!)
