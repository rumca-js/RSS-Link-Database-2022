Autopsy-based histopathological characterization of myocarditis after anti-SARS-CoV-2-vaccination

Likelihood assessment of vaccine-induced 
(epi-)myocarditis

Causality or correlation?

Presence of myocarditis with temporal association to vaccination event

AND

Integration of histological phenotype, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings indicate no alternative differential diagnosis

Abstract infographic

Cases of myocarditis

Have been diagnosed clinically,

by laboratory tests,

imaging

(in the context of mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination)

Autopsy-based description

We describe,

Cardiac autopsy findings and common characteristics of myocarditis,

with vaccine-induced myocardial inflammation representing the likely or possible cause of death. 

Our findings establish the histological phenotype of lethal vaccination-associated myocarditis.

Standardized autopsies

Performed on 25 persons

25 bodies found unexpectedly dead at home,

within 20 days following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

Histology

Patchy, focal, interstitial myocardial T-lymphocytic and macrophage
infiltration,

predominantly of the CD4 positive sub- set, (T Helper cells)

associated with mild myocyte damage. 

Autopsy findings indicated

Death due to acute arrhythmogenic cardiac failure. 

Thus

Myocarditis can be a potentially lethal complication following mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 

Our findings may aid in adequately diagnosing unclear cases after vaccination,

and in establishing a timely diagnosis in vivo, thus, 

providing the framework for adequate monitoring and early treatment of severe clinical cases.
