Not only that, unlike Switch or PlayStation, there isn't exactly a \"first-party\" publisher on PC, which means there are few true marquee exclusive games on the platform. Therefore, this list of the year's five best PC games naturally features games you'll sometimes (though not always) find elsewhere, but in cases where multiplatform games appear, we believe they're best played on PC and deserve a spot on this list. This year's list is an eclectic bunch, too, with a speedrunning gem, a deep detective-like experience, and a physics playground all earning top spots.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ckBPejAqgU", "date_published": "2022-12-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Bonelab\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down more of the weaponry of Bonelab, including the Benelli M4 shotgun being used in tandem with a shield, and AKM being used as a club, as well as the M1 Garand, and a Micro-Uzi.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:51 - AKM\n04:07 - Using an AK as a club\n04:59 - Skeleton using a Remington 870\n06:29 - Micro-Uzi\n07:31 - M1 Garand\n09:05 - AR15\n11:23 - KRISS Vector-\n12:40 - Ruger Mk III\n14:07 - Benelli M4 Shotgun\n16:11 - Shotgun & Shield\n24:48 - Ending\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Bonelab and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\n\nLink to Lam0rak's mod map used in the episode https://mod.io/g/bonelab/m/genesismesa\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALVAP0DNyE", "date_published": "2022-12-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best Nintendo Switch Games of 2022", "description": "The Nintendo Switch is getting up in years, but the hybrid portable console is still going strong. The platform had a solid year of great new releases, especially from outside the realm of Nintendo's usual top-tier franchises.\nGames like Kirby and Switch Sports were excellent callbacks to some beloved brands that didn't lean hard on bigger names like Mario or Zelda. Xenoblade Chronicles marked another enormous RPG for the platform that has become known as a destination for playing epics on the go.\u00a0\n\nIn the realm of Nintendo's biggest franchises, this was a year of unusual entries. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope returned to the bizarre tactical game partnership between Nintendo and Ubisoft, to exceptional results. And Pokemon Legends: Arceus was a big departure from the usual Pokemon formula, helping to chart a new path forward that we saw partly iterated on in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which released later in the year.\u00a0\n\nNintendo was not immune to delays, however, which pushed some games outside of the 2022 release window. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--previously informally known as Breath of the Wild 2--was pushed to May 2023. And in an unpredictable turn of events, Nintendo made the last-minute decision to indefinitely delay the release of Advance Wars Reboot Camp in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Either or both of those games remain among our most anticipated, and could very well have landed on this list.\u00a0\n\nDespite those hurdles, this was an incredibly strong year for the Nintendo Switch, with a wide array of games that will keep you playing docked and handheld well into the new year.\n\n#gamespot #gaming #nintendo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wKIT3DqpsI", "date_published": "2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite Adds New My Hero Academia Themed Mode | GameSpot News", "description": "My Hero comes to Fortnite, Horizon is getting a multiplayer games, and more Sega Genesis games come to Nintendo Switch.\n\n#Gaming #Fortnite #MyHeroAcademia\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 - Fortnite x My Hero Academia\n01:12 - Horizon multiplayer game announced\n02:14 - New Sega Genesis games on Switch Online", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl5gs-O4Yao", "date_published": "2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite x My Hero Academia Bakugo Victory Royale Gameplay", "description": "Check out a match of Fortnite with the new Mythic Item, Deku's Smash.

The cartel wishes to round up every human on the planet and sell them as the drug, which other aliens can consume via elaborate machines. Our bounty hunter hero is armed with Gatlians, a race of talking guns, and each Gatlian possesses its own attacks and abilities. The concept is admittedly very weird, but it's a well-told story that kept me guessing until the end.\n\nAt this point, it bears acknowledging that this is 100% a Justin Roiland project, complete with all the hallmarks of his comedic philosophy. Rapid-fire monologues, fart jokes, demolition of the fourth wall, ad-libs, dark comedy--it's all intertwined within the game's narrative and presentation. If things like Rick and Morty, Trover Saves The Universe, or Solar Opposites aren't your cup of tea, this won't be either. That said, I have a very high tolerance for this sort of goofiness and I found myself laughing throughout the 10-hour adventure.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VND8WpDHoEs", "date_published": "2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Valve Talks The Next Steam Deck | GameSpot News", "description": "Valve shares details on the future of the Steam Deck, Spider-Man 2 gets a smaller release window, and some new details on Starfield.\n\n#Gaming #SteamDeck #SpiderMan2 #Starfield\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 - Steam Deck interview\n02:16 - Spider-Man 2 release window\n03:28 - Starfield factions details", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYApxI4a5Bg", "date_published": "2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
