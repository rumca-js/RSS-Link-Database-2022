<p>The Japanese government held an emergency meeting and share prices crashed after a Pokémon broadcast. For years, its effects went unexplained – until researchers started digging …</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, at precisely 6.51pm on 16 December 1997, hundreds of children across Japan experienced seizures. In total, 685 – 310 boys and 375 girls – were taken by ambulance to hospital. Within two days, 12,000 children had reported symptoms of illness. The common factor in this sudden mass outbreak was an unlikely culprit: an episode of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/pokemon">Pokémon</a> cartoon series.</p><p>The instalment in question, Dennō Senshi Porygon (Electric Soldier Porygon), was the 38th<sup> </sup>in the Pokémon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anime">anime</a>’s first season – and initially, at least, it sparked a medical mystery. Twenty minutes into the cartoon, an explosion took place, illustrated by an animation technique known as paka paka, which broadcast alternating red and blue flashing lights at a rate of 12Hz for six seconds. Instantly, hundreds of children experienced photosensitive epileptic seizures – accounting for some, but far from all, of the hospitalisations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/16/pokemon-explosion-tv-japan-children-hospital">Continue reading...</a>

The atmosphere at their games has been electric and there is a religious feel to their fandom.</p><p>Even though a few images of the Pope pop up here and there, it’s more a devotion to the two messiahs of Argentinian football: Maradona and Messi. On the backs of replica Argentina shirts you don’t see any other names. Identical twins at the semi-final against Croatia were wearing T-shirts: one had Lionel Messi on the front, the other Diego Maradona. On flags, banners and headdresses you see mocked-up images showing Maradona handing a ball to Messi – as if imploring him to continue carrying the fight.

<p>Pushback on stories critical of the World Cup hosts has come from lobbyists and lawyers operating out of London</p><p>When British journalists were writing about the treatment of migrant workers building World Cup stadiums, they might have expected to receive a phone call from a Qatari based in Doha, pushing back on their accusations. Instead, newspapers found themselves being contacted by Britons such as George Pascoe-Watson, a former political editor of the Sun, challenging the premise of their story and offering a more pro-Qatari viewpoint.</p><p>Pascoe-Watson is a senior partner at Portland, a high-end London-based public relations and lobbying company founded by Tony Blair’s former adviser, Tim Allan. It is one of many British-based firms who have benefitted from spinning on behalf of the Qatari government ahead of the World Cup, pushing the Gulf nation’s case in the media, and arguing against negative coverage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/16/how-british-pr-firms-won-big-representing-qatar-2022-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

We should be clear that strike action on this scale is unprecedented in the history of our National Health Service.</p><p>As a doctor myself, I would never strike, because I worry about the impact on my patients.

<p>Like everything else about the hit indie farming game, Stardew Valley’s soundtrack is an extension of its creator, Eric Barone. He reveals how he composed it by listening to the weather</p><p>Earlier this year, Eric Barone was approached by singer-songwriter Molly Rankin of power-pop group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/11/alvvays-molly-rankin-interview-blue-rev">Alvvays</a>. The game developer, best known as the one-man creative force behind the hit farming simulator Stardew Valley, was asked if he would like to contribute some art for the band’s new single, Many Mirrors. Never one to limit himself, or to do things by halves, Barone created a whole music video instead. “That’s just how I work,” he tells me. “I don’t hold back.”</p><p>You can tell from his work that Barone puts the whole of himself into it. Now almost seven years old and still hugely popular, Stardew Valley is an extension of who he is. When you work on the graphics, the programming, the audio, the systems and the writing all at once, you project a fairly complete image of who you are on to the world. For some people that would be daunting, but Barone embraces it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/16/stardew-valley-eric-barone-interview-soundtrack-seasons-high-scores">Continue reading...</a>

<p>World Cup winner reflects on his innate competitiveness, family tragedy and coming out of retirement to play in the snow at Exeter</p><p>A compelling force clearly still drives Bismarck du Plessis. He is 38 now and there is plenty else to occupy him on the family farm near Bethlehem, 165 miles due south of Johannesburg. He and his wife, Anja, already have three boys, including six-year-old identical twins, with twin girls due in March. After 79 caps for South Africa, a 2007 World Cup winner’s medal and multiple other honours, the battle-scarred hooker could be excused for seeking a quieter life.</p><p>And yet here he is, dragging his aching body halfway around the world to hit more rucks in Exeter on a freezing Saturday in the shadow of Christmas. The bleak midwinter challenge at Sandy Park in the Champions Cup on Saturday appears, if anything, to be an extra incentive. “My kids’ godparents live not far away and they’ve been sending me pictures of the snow. I’ve sent them to the young boys in our squad and told them there’s a rude awakening waiting for us.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/16/bismarck-du-plessis-every-time-i-can-put-my-boots-on-i-feel-fortunate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s easy to teach your feline companion to sit or follow a target, says behaviour expert Daniel Warren-Cummings</p><p>This year <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-022-01674-w" title="">a French study</a> found that cats know when their owners are talking to them, adding to a growing body of evidence that cats might be more bonded to us than we think. So if cats rival dogs as man’s best friends, could we train them in the same way? I asked behaviourist Daniel Cummings from welfare charity Cats Protection.</p><p><strong>Recently it was demonstrated that cats can, to some extent, </strong><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7401521/" title="">read human emotions</a>, </strong><strong>leading some to suggest </strong><strong>they could be therapy animals for their owners. </strong><strong>Could </strong><strong>a cat be trained </strong><strong>to be a support animal?</strong><br />Oh yes! I would say such training is universal across all species. It’s mostly positive reinforcement – so rewarding the animal when they do the right thing, until eventually they learn “if I do this, something good happens”. You could do that with a dog, cat, alligator, elephant – you could even maybe try it with some invertebrates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/16/can-i-train-my-cat-like-a-dog-we-ask-an-expert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Too often, those in charge of Fifa and Uefa have put gain above the common good. Diversity and equality must be defended</p><p>A World Cup works always and everywhere. There is nothing like it – and it is a diverse event. Eleven men or women are actively involved on both sides, even up to 17 due to the new rule with substitutions. All continents take part, and Sunday’s finalists Argentina lost in Qatar to a country from Asia – Saudi Arabia – and almost had to go into extra time against Australia. Thanks to Morocco, Africa – alternatively Arabia – made it to the semi-finals for the first time.</p><p>At a football tournament, the world negotiates how it wants to live together. The game provides material for discussions in all directions. Was the ball out before Japan’s winning goal against Spain? Can offside be measured digitally, as technology optimists believe? Is the Palestine flag political, and what does it say? Was the OneLove armband necessary? What signal does it send when Muslim athletes dance with and kiss their mothers in front of the world after victories?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/16/football-is-the-most-attractive-game-but-its-governors-are-squandering-its-joy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the past 12 months I have learned that the mass extermination of the Amazon is a climate catastrophe –  and much more</p><p>I thought it was a blood moon at first. The dark orange glow appeared at dusk on the far side of the shimmering silver band that is the Xingu River. It was just before 8pm, after the parrots had squawked back to their nests and the insects and frogs were noisily starting the forest nightshift. A flash of lightning from a cloud appeared above almost the same location but the rest of the sky was clear. How could there be a storm? I peered more intently and took a photograph that I could magnify. And there was the answer – a fire, which grew fiercer as I watched, the flames spreading sideways and upwards, flickering red and yellow, billowing smoke into the sky, sparking flashes of lightning every couple of minutes.</p><p>I felt sick to the stomach. The Amazon rainforest was being destroyed in front of my eyes. I have been writing about the climate crisis for 16 years, always with a sense of horror but until now, mostly with a sense of distance. This was the first time I had seen it from my home, and it was stranger than I expected. I had not realised until that moment that fire can create its own lightning storms, by creating <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/pyrocb.html">pyrocumulonimbus</a>, which scientists describe as “the fire-breathing dragon of clouds”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/16/year-in-the-life-of-the-amazon-deforestation-climate-disaster-mass-extermination">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The traditional comforting pud gets a cranberry and almond twist for a touch of festive flair</p><p>Bread and butter pudding: so simple, so comforting. For the most part I quite like a traditional one, but during the festive season, I’m more than happy to break a few rules. The cranberries bring a welcome burst of colour and a delicious tartness that cuts through everything rich.

If France beat Argentina on Sunday, they will become the first team to retain the World Cup since the Brazil side of Pelé and Garrincha in 1962. Didier Deschamps’ side have already overcome one curse by reaching the final, which is a huge achievement considering how poorly recent winners have performed while defending their titles.</p><p>Four of the previous five World Cup winners failed to get past the first round of the next tournament, so what looked like an easy group for France – Australia, Denmark and Tunisia – was not as simple as it initially appeared.

<p>Arrest of Greek MEP and her boyfriend at centre of top-secret investigation into a criminal conspiracy</p><p>The police had been waiting since dawn. Officers from the special unit of Belgium’s federal police gathered on Rue Wiertz, close to the European parliament in Brussels. The parliament, which likes to style itself the house of European democracy, had been at the centre of a months-long, top-secret investigation. Investigators believed a Gulf country – unofficially confirmed as Qatar – was trying to sway decisions at the assembly, using vast sums of cash and lavish gifts. Now they were about to arrest the man they thought was at the centre of the criminal conspiracy.</p><p>He was Francesco Giorgi, an assistant at the parliament. Charismatic and well-connected, the young Italian lived with his partner, Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP, who had enjoyed a meteoric rise to become one of the parliament’s 14 vice-presidents since her election in 2014. As soon as Giorgi left the building, police surrounded him. His interrogation – and seizure of his phone – was deemed crucial to the investigation, according to Le Soir, which recounted the details of his morning arrest. By lunchtime last Friday, police had searched 16 properties in Brussels, arrested five others including Kaili, seized laptops, phones and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash. Two people were later released without charge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/16/a-tragic-affair-european-parliament-stunned-by-qatar-corruption-inquiry">Continue reading...</a>

As well as being long overdue, it came after an extended period of work cannibalising my nights, weekends and few remaining shreds of sanity, pushing me close to the brink of burnout. Which is to say: I really needed this. It was, predictably, wonderful. I went to Bali for a week and did blissfully little. I swam, read a couple of books, drank cocktails of varying quality and got a massage every day.</p><p>I also did a lot of yoga. On day two of the trip, a friend took me to a studio called Radiantly Alive (this is the vibe of Ubud) for a 90-minute hatha class. I had done yoga precisely once before, at a Fitness First inside a Canberra shopping mall. This was a very different experience. I stood in a large room surrounded by beautiful Balinese nature, sunlight and a gentle breeze filtering in through the open windows, some kind of chillout mix on the speakers. I didn’t know my happy babies from my downward dogs, but nonetheless emerged from the class limber and in a state of bliss. I felt … radiantly alive.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/17/time-away-from-my-usual-routine-made-me-realise-what-was-missing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Host country prepares for day of celebration on Sunday as Argentina take on France, with Lionel Messi on a mission</p><p>It takes only a few minutes to spot the first Lionel Messi shirt after stepping out of Msheireb metro station. Keep going towards Souq Waqif and, although the streets of downtown Doha are not playing host to a typical football atmosphere, images of the little Argentinian genius are hard to miss. There are countless Messi T-shirts hanging from the stalls in the market, there is even a painting of him in the front window of the Souq Waqif Art Center, and judging by the mood among the tourists mooching around the city most people will be backing Argentina when they meet France in the World Cup final on Sunday night.</p><p>As one stallholder puts it as he sells another Argentina scarf, nobody is particularly interested in his France merchandise.

But why stop at this year? We have seen other stars make racist statements, experience career-ruining scandals or psychologically disintegrate in public, but to witness all three converge in extremis over two months is unprecedented.</p><p>It should spell career suicide. But Ye has ended the year in the top fivemost-streamed artists of 2022 on Spotify in the UK and the US. His 2021 album Donda is No 43 on Billboard’s chart of the year’s most popular albums. When he isn’t suspended from Twitter, he has 30.6m followers there. As he well knows, media outlets track his every move. People aren’t only still listening; they’re watching, too. Despite being on an apparently terminal course, Ye isn’t about to disappear: this is just the latest chapter in his mission to test the public’s threshold for disgust.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/16/kanye-west-antisemitic-rapper-ye-spotify">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The trio burst on to the mid-70s scene only for their label to bury their debut. As it resurfaces, singer Paul Southwell looks back at a band who would have changed LGBTQ+ history</p><p>In 1971, 19-year-old musician Paul Southwell left Accrington and headed for the bright lights. At that time London’s gay scene consisted of a selection of seedy pubs, after-hours basement drinking dens and regular discos organised by the Gay Liberation Front, which had formed the previous October. But none of the acts playing GLF events were out: most of the entertainment was supplied by decidedly straight bands.</p><p>Southwell would change that. Alongside Dave Jenkins and Alan Jordan, he formed Handbag, a powerpop band whose look was influenced by the Rocky Horror Show and whose material included covers of Lou Reed and David Bowie songs as well as originals about gay motorcycle gangs (Leather Boys) and cruising (42nd East Street). The gay trio quickly built a following, playing GLF benefits, LGBTQ+ events and the busy pub rock circuit, although many gigs were pulled when venue managers realised exactly what kind of act they had booked. “We would dress outrageously,” says Southwell. “We’d kiss each other on stage and simulate sex – whatever a song warranted.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/16/wed-kiss-each-other-on-stage-and-simulate-sex-the-pioneering-gay-powerpop-of-handbag">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have taken to leaving restaurants such as this by simply WhatsApping an image of a highwayman to denote paying the bill</p><p>First, let us tackle the name <a href="https://www.saltiegirl.com/location/saltie-girl-london/">Saltie Girl</a>, which, frankly, sounds less than delicious. Which parts of her are salty? Her armpits? Her toes? Her choice of language? The owners of Saltie Girl say the phrase is old Maine colloquial for mermaid, and have opened branches of this seafood-fixated restaurant in Boston, Los Angeles and, now, London. Over here, the name is just odd and slightly offputting, but then, when you’re selling lobster on waffle at £36 a throw, it’s not just the name that will be keeping casual passers-by at bay.</p><p>Saltie Girl has opened its London branch on North Audley Street in Mayfair, a stone’s throw from Selfridge’s in a locale that’s home to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/27/apricity-london-w1-grace-dent-restaurant-review">Apricity</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/08/bibi-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Bibi</a>, two restaurants I recommend everyone goes to if time, funds and occasion fit, both being outstanding examples of modern, innovative dining and fine service.

<p>How did the actor prepare to become a new-fangled Ebenezer? By channelling Cruella De Vil and watching Drag Race, of course! She talks about her Christmas gift to Gentleman Jack fans – and how to escape a torpedo tube</p><p>Start your engines, because Suranne Jones is about to become the first ever Scrooge inspired by a TV drag competition. In Christmas Carole, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/28/bbc-vigil-suranne-jones">Vigil</a> and Doctor Foster star plays a new version of Ebenezer Scrooge – called, of course, Carole. “When I was filming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/10/gentleman-jack-series-two-review-one-of-the-greatest-british-period-dramas-of-our-time">Gentleman Jack</a>, I watched 13 series of RuPaul’s Drag Race,” says Jones. “I told the director, Carole is like a drag persona. At first, he thought I was mad. But she’s got that superhero-ness, that self-belief and confidence and single-mindedness. It was really useful to use Drag Race in that way.” When she read the script, she made a moodboard for what Carole might look like. “Anna Wintour was on there. And Cruella de Vil. And Nicole Kidman from Paddington. Carole is instantly recognisable, with the bob, the red lips, the red bag and the red nails. And I could just be horrible. Really horrible. And it was great.”</p><p>Horrible though Carole may be, it is probably the most cheerful show Jones has done in quite some time. Over the last couple of years, she has stomped her way around the industrial revolution in 19th-century Yorkshire (Gentleman Jack), endured panic attacks and a breakdown (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/05/i-am-victoria-review-a-masterclass-in-what-pushes-a-woman-to-the-edge">I Am Victoria</a>), had a child go missing (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/28/save-me-review-suranne-jones-drama-benidorm">Save Me</a>) and woken up trapped inside a submarine torpedo tube that was slowly filling with water (Vigil).

<p>Narrator Paapa Essiedu delivers the chills in this atmospheric telling of Hill’s classic ghost story</p><p>Susan Hill’s 1983 novella opens on Christmas Eve with the retired solicitor Arthur Kipps at home with his second wife, Esmé, and his stepchildren. When they ask him to tell them a ghost story, he offers up a tale of “haunting and evil, fear and confusion, horror and tragedy … an inextricable part of my past”. It is a story so bleak, he continues, that he cannot say it out loud; he will write it down so that he “might finally be free of it”.</p><p>It concerns a visit made by Kipps as a young man to Eel Marsh House, a coastal mansion at the end of a causeway which is cut off from the mainland at high tide. He has been dispatched there by his boss to settle the affairs of a deceased widow named Alice Drablow. Kipps sifts through acres of paperwork, working through the night alone – or so he thinks. In the midst of his work, he catches glimpses of a ghostly woman dressed in black. Eventually a local man, Sam Daily, informs him that Alice Drablow’s sister Jennet haunts the house. During Jennet’s life, her child died in a terrible accident; legend has it that whenever the woman in black appears, another child dies in the village.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/16/the-woman-in-black-by-susan-hill-audiobook-review-immersive-gothic-horror">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steven Spielberg’s thorny family drama gave us unusual insight into how the world’s most famous director came to be</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-movies-films-of-2022-in-the-us">50 best movies of 2022 in the US</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture">More on the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>The first thing you realize watching The Fabelmans is that Steven Spielberg has been telling the story of his childhood in bits and pieces throughout his career – through the domestic turmoil in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the suburban expanses of ET the Extra Terrestrial, and the many lost boys left to grow up on their own. Yet Spielberg has waited until now to tell his story directly, from the perspective of a grownup who may have experienced a turbulent adolescence, but didn’t fully comprehend the complexities of adult relationships until he aged a little himself and could see the past more clearly.</p><p>Along with great films such as Armageddon Time and Aftersun, 2022 has been a year of thorny nostalgia pieces, with directors rejecting the cozy conventions of the coming-of-age film in order to interrogate memories rather than preserve them in amber. With a crucial assist from Tony Kushner, who brought so much dimension to Spielberg’s West Side Story last year, the script for The Fabelmans is structured around a boy’s journey from his magical first trip to the movies, where he thrilled to the spectacle of The Greatest Show on Earth, to his appearance on a studio lot as a young adult. Yet the way his movie-love dovetails with family upheaval makes an important point about Spielberg’s brand of commercial film-making: blockbusters don’t have to be impersonal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/best-movies-of-2022-in-the-us-no-6-the-fabelmans">Continue reading...</a>

## It’s not enough for Labour to be a nicer version of the Tories. It must take risks for what is right | Simon Jenkins

<p>Instead of fighting for the centre ground, Keir Starmer should look to the radical changes pushed through under Harold Wilson</p><p>The pitch is being rolled for Keir Starmer’s entry to No 10. Titles on the prospect of a Labour Britain already line the bookshop shelves, from Oliver Eagleton’s The Starmer Project to Lisa Nandy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/28/all-in-how-we-build-country-that-works-by-lisa-nandy-review-why-labour-must-give-power-to-the-people">All In</a>. Who is he really? Is he a socialist in sheep’s clothing, or just another moderate, pragmatic, oh-so-hesitant Labour leader trapped in an ideological no-man’s-land between left and “left-of-centre”?</p><p>The one label that no one could pin on Starmer is “radical”. After the trauma of Liz Truss, economic policy has sunk into a grim torpor. Starmer has eschewed alternative economic models, terrified of the reaction of markets and thus, possibly, of voters. He is so fearful of the issue of Brexit – <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/leavers-more-likely-to-regret-brexit-vote-than-remainers-study-finds">which many Britons who voted for it now regret</a> – that he has become its most effective supporter. On social policy, Labour is all platitude and nothing structural. Britain is drifting down Europe’s league table on health outcomes, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-drug-situation-focal-point-annual-report/uk-drug-situation-2019-summary">drug abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.russellwebster.com/how-does-our-prison-system-compare/#:~:text=In%20January%202021%2C%20the%20prison,116.1%20and%20median%20of%20101.8">prison population</a> and <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01403/#:~:text=European%20context,applications%20for%20every%2010%2C000%20people.">reception of migrants</a>.

<p>To kick off list season, these are the films, shows, albums, podcasts and books we couldn’t get enough of this year</p><p>This week we’re highlighting some of the great culture released in 2022. We won’t be offering a definitive ranking – that’s being very handily covered by the Guardian’s various arts desks, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-films-movies-of-2022-in-the-uk">film</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-albums-of-2022">music</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/02/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2022">TV</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/15/the-best-theatre-of-2022">stage</a>, with art and games still to come.

Meanwhile, performers were able to showcase what they had been cooking up in those lost lockdown months, and in many cases the results were spectacular. The news wasn’t all positive, though.

<p>I lasted two episodes of the royal couple’s series before bailing out. Turns out I’m just not that interested</p><p>An old friend died recently. The cause of death has not been made public, but he is believed to have killed himself. The news came as a profound shock. Though I knew he had had mental health problems, I thought he was largely out the other side and had found a way of living with them. Our relationship was unusual. We rarely – if ever – socialised together, but knew each other intimately. We were in the same psychotherapy group for many years. I’m still going. He was a lovely man. Generous, warm, kind and very, very funny. And damaged. Though you can take that as read. My heart goes out to his wife and children. When I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/i-was-a-heroin-addict-and-had-given-up-on-myself-then-suddenly-briefly-i-felt-a-desire-to-live">was in rehab</a> more than 35 years ago, one of the counsellors told us that, statistically speaking, half of us would be dead within 15 years or so. At the time I just thought she was trying to shock us into changing our behaviour, but it turned out she was telling no more than the truth. Half of us were dead well within the time frame. Since then the death rate among those people I knew who were addicts has at times felt attritional. Quite apart from the usual suspects of relapse, overdose, Aids and suicide, the incidence of death through cancer and heart disease have been far higher among the addicts I know than other people. It might just be a coincidence but I suspect not. My dad, towards the end of his life, used to say that old age wasn’t for wimps. I’m beginning to know how he felt. The number of people who used to know me as a young man are getting fewer and fewer. It’s starting to get lonely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/digested-week-give-me-the-white-lotus-over-harry-and-meghan-any-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dry shady area around my tatty old shed needs a creative approach</p><p>I own a shed. It is possibly the cheapest, most shoddily built shed going. I like it but it is not pretty enough to make me happy when I have to look at it every time I open the back door. So I moved it. Now it sits between the end of the privet hedge and an old lilac, in a dark, dry nook where little would otherwise grow.</p><p>It sits on a very slapped-together base made up of all the ugly concrete slabs that were kicking around, with many gaps and strange levels to boot.

Perfect for a grandparent hunting a last-minute Christmas gift, or a parent looking for something that will appeal to a child reluctant to read, books by stars have become the go-to for many. Those buying them might have it in the back of their minds that these “authors” might not have done much of the writing. But that doesn’t matter, does it? As long as the kids are reading, that’s what counts.</p><p>For children’s authors who do write their own stuff, it’s a little galling. They’d give their hind teeth for a spot on that shelf – and surely they are no less deserving of exposure and recognition. As a writer of children’s fiction, I’ve been known to turn a shade of green, too. But I’m conflicted, because in addition to writing original and mostly unrecognised books for young readers, I also work as a ghost writer. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/16/im-parking-my-guilt-confessions-of-a-celebrity-childrens-book-ghost-writer">Continue reading...</a>

Like so many other girls, I identified with Jo and her temper and her unappreciated talent, despised Amy, grieved for Beth and was utterly indifferent to Meg and whatever conventional visions of happiness she had. My other favourite was A House Is Not a Home, the memoir of a New York madam, by Polly Adler. Despite the fact that I didn’t really grasp what the girls did in the evening I loved this book for its portrait of backstage life, as it were, and female solidarity. And I love that neither the librarian, nor my mother, took it out of my hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/16/amy-bloom-nigella-lawson-is-god-if-were-lucky">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Xbox, PC; Squanch Games</strong><br />This first-person shooter from Rick and Morty’s co-creator pairs a barrage of nihilistic jokes with flimsy gameplay</p><p>I honestly can’t tell you whether High on Life is funny. Humour is subjective, sure, but also, after eight hours of this game’s rapid-fire jokes, I’m not sure I even know any more. You spend enough time spacefaring in Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland’s orbit and eventually, you get sucked into the void. It’s no longer a series of clearly delineated jokes, more a transcendental oneness with an eternal bit. Body fluids. Self-reflexive observations. Observations about the self-reflexive observations. Casual misanthropy. More body fluids. You switch from a grin to a grimace every 15 seconds and at some point, your face just goes numb.</p><p>I can tell you that this game is consistently creative, even when new studio Squanch’s design chops fail them. You play a nameless teen bounty hunter paired up with a talking gun, travelling the universe attempting to free humanity from an alien crime syndicate that wants to use us as drugs. Along the way, you’ll use your chattering gun’s abilities to solve traversal puzzles in a Metroid Prime sort of way, and do a lot of shooting. There are some genuinely nifty and thoughtful combat options, like a ricocheting sawblade that you can bonk back at baddies, or a shotgun that hoovers protective slime from your foes.</p><p>High on Life is out now; £46.49, or included with a Game Pass subscription<br /><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/16/high-on-life-review-limp-gunplay-and-questionable-taste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Sheffield quartet’s elegant, lounge-funk-inflected seventh album was an introspective, elliptical ode to a time that may only live in the mind of its frontman</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-albums-of-2022">The 50 best albums of 2022</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/05/the-20-best-songs-of-2022">The best songs of 2022</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture">More of the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>Late theorist and writer Mark Fisher didn’t especially like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcticmonkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a>. He considered the Sheffield band an example of how so much “new” art in the 21st century is rooted in nostalgia. “Arctic Monkeys airbrush cultural time out and appeal to this endless return and timelessness of rock,” <a href="https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/mark-fisher-interview/">he said to Crack magazine</a> in 2014. It’s undeniable that part of the band’s success across two decades – from Myspace-propelled teens, to bona fide rock stars, to cosmic piano crooners in space – has relied on this innate sense of timelessness. But it’s hard not to wonder what Fisher would have thought listening to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/18/arctic-monkeys-the-car-review-aching-songs-of-soured-dreams">The Car</a>, the group’s refined, lounge-y, cinematic, orchestral seventh album. Nodding to Bowie, the Beatles and bossa nova, it seems in its own way to be contemplating time.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/big-reads/arctic-monkeys-cover-interview-2022-the-car-3332436">an interview with NME</a>, frontman Alex Turner said of The Car: “So much of this new music is scratching at the past and how much of it I should hang on to.” It makes sense: Arctic Monkeys’ best music has always been about yearning in all its forms; here, this is manifest in Turner’s unmistakable, swooning vocals, brimming with intimacy and lyrical longing, and instrumentals that make moods of love, lust, grief, insecurity and dislocation flutter somewhere deep within. The Car delves into depths and subtleties of feeling with gilded music that belongs to a past which never existed: velveteen strings, gleaming keys and licks of guitar that veer from funky to blazing and anticipatory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/16/the-50-best-albums-of-2022-no-6-arctic-monkeys-the-car">Continue reading...</a>

## How Strasbourg became the evergreen ‘capital of Christmas’

<p>From sustainable gifts to energy-efficient fairy lights and hotels using only local products, here’s how to have yourself an eco-friendly Christmas in France</p><p>It’s mid-morning on a December Saturday and Strasbourg’s rue des Orfèvres is rammed with festive shoppers. They’re gawping into patisserie shops and jewellery boutiques, snapping photos and soaking up the festive cheer on this narrow street close to the city’s mighty cathedral. Above our heads, the ancient buildings’ facades are decorated with giant baubles, fat teddy bears and glittery bows and, while you can see a web of fairy lights wound among these arrangements, the lights are decidedly “off”.</p><p>Strasbourg, the self-proclaimed French “capital of Christmas”, draws 2.5 million visitors to its world-famous <em>marché de Noël</em>. This year, efforts to make the yuletide fun more eco-friendly are in tune with other city-wide initiatives, such as the 373 miles (600km) of bike paths that saw it crowned “cycling capital of France”. This means those Christmas lights won’t be switched on until sundown and will go off at 11pm (when previously they were on 24/7). Many have been replaced by more energy-efficient LEDs and the city has been clever not to double up by hanging lights where businesses have their own bright decorations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/dec/16/strasbourg-christmas-break-france-eco-friendly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Angels in America writer talks about antisemitism, homophobia and working on The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s loosely autobiographical film about a teenager obsessed with cinema</p><p>It’s lunchtime a couple of weeks before Christmas. Past the tree in the glitzy lobby of Claridge’s hotel in London ambles a man who, in his octagonal glasses, workman’s jacket, jeans and trainers, looks a little out of place. Once installed in his room, however, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tony-kushner">Tony Kushner</a> is entirely in his element. Insights on art, history and politics pour out at the slightest prompting. He cites writers from Conor McPherson to Robert Lowell, gives a lightning-quick insight into Othello (too cruel a play, he says, for him to catch National Theatre’s new production on this trip) and, in the 50 minutes we talk, widens my vocabulary by three words (abreacting, recrudesce and armamentarium).</p><p>It’s not hard to see why Steven Spielberg has chosen him to write (or co-write) the scripts for four of his films: Munich, Lincoln, West Side Story and his latest, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/11/the-fabelmans-review-steven-spielberg-drama">The Fabelmans</a>.

## Babylon review – Brad Pitt suaves through a grand hymn to golden age Hollywood

<p>Pitt and Margot Robbie, and many razzle dazzle setpieces, help lift a story in no hurry to engage with the true-life nastiness of its era</p><p>Damien Chazelle returns to that la la land in which he made his big breakthrough, with a turbocharged but heavy-handed epic about the secret chaos and excess of 1920s silent-era Hollywood on the verge of talkie extinction, inspired by some well-known anecdotes and further embellishing the apocryphal rumours and tales. It’s a love letter to the movies, inevitably, though I remember Chazelle’s previous films being love letters to actual human beings. There are preemptive references to Singin’ in the Rain and it climaxes with a swoony-solemn Oscar-telecast-type montage including clips from Maya Deren’s Meshes of the Afternoon and James Cameron’s Terminator 2. Funny though Babylon often is, in all its frantic melodrama it is weirdly without the gentle romantic sweetness and believable human frailty in his Oscar-winning film La La Land (although there are musical echoes of that earlier picture and the same message that jazz is where integrity is to be found in showbusiness).</p><p>Chazelle is also concerned to restore some of the minorities who have been erased in Hollywood’s history, as well as be more candid about the sordid realities, but he fudges the new #MeToo conversation about the Hollywood golden age: all the raunchy sex here is very much consensual. Pundits have cited silent movie historian and evangelist Kevin Brownlow in relation to this film, but the debt is obviously more to Kenneth Anger, author of Hollywood Babylon – and frankly even more to Baz Luhrmann than either. The outrageous party scenes, with the mandatory overhead shots showing the ecstatically unclothed women crowd-surfing face-up are so much like Luhrmann he should be getting a royalty cheque.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/babylon-review-hollywood-brad-pitt-margot-robbie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Norway’s world No 1 did not lose a single game in his 22-4 victory, and achieved the rare feat of 10 successive wins, which in online speed chess jargon qualifies as adopting your opponent</p><p>Magnus Carlsen’s achievements are so many that it is hard for the Norwegian to surprise fans any more, but the No 1’s crushing online blitz victory against Fabiano Caruana on Tuesday was remarkable.</p><p>Caruana is the reigning US champion, and had scored an even 6-6 in his classical games against Carlsen in their 2018 world title match in London. This week, they were paired in a quarter-final of the annual $100,000 Chess.com speed championship, whose format of 90 minutes play at 5/1 (five minutes per player per game plus one second per move increment), 60 minutes at 3/1 blitz, and 30 minutes of 1/1 bullet, is a searching test of endurance, creativity, and fast reactions over a marathon course of around 25-30 games in three hours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/16/chess-carlsen-adopts-us-champion-fabiano-caruana-in-online-blitz-rout">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An Iranian political activist, now in jail herself, interviews 12 female prisoners of the Islamic Republic about their experiences</p><p>I can’t think when I last came across a book that opened with such disturbing words: “I am writing this preface in the final hours of my home leave. Very soon I will be forced to return to my prison … This time I was found guilty because of the book you are holding in your hands – White Torture.<em>”</em> That was last March. Narges Mohammadi, a leading Iranian political dissident, had been briefly released from jail because she had had a heart attack, followed by cardiac surgery. Now she is a prisoner again, facing 80 lashes and a total of more than 30 years behind bars. Part of her sentence will be spent in solitary confinement. “I declare once more that this is a cruel and inhumane punishment,” she writes. “I will not rest until it is abolished.”</p><p>Mohammadi builds up her campaign against solitary confinement partly with her own story, but mostly through interviews with 12 other Iranian women who have also experienced it. They come from different backgrounds and were jailed for a variety of things the Islamic republic regards as crimes: being a member of the Bahá’i religious minority, or a Sufi, converting to Christianity, supporting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mek" title="">People’s Mujahedin</a>, or simply getting involved in protest movements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/16/white-torture-by-narges-mohammadi-review-solitary-savagery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If the prime minister can’t close the gap on Labour, many Tory MPs predict the ‘wild’ return of his rival in the spring</p><p>Three years ago this week, Boris Johnson was looking ahead to a long premiership – eight years at least. As the result broke of a majority of 80 in the 2019 election the prime minister pitched himself as a Blair-like figure – heading to Sedgefield, where his party had turned the former prime minister’s seat blue, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/boris-johnson-boasts-sedgefield-victory-17414652">for his victory rally</a>. The implication was clear: Johnson was a leader who would be as influential and long-lasting in British politics as Tony Blair.</p><p>Fast forward to today and things look rather different. Johnson is on the backbenches – having been forced to resign in the face of successive scandals. After Liz Truss’s short stint in the job, he launched one aborted attempt to return. His former chancellor and political rival Rishi Sunak is now in charge. The polls suggest the Conservatives are on course for a heavy defeat at the next election, which could even include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/28/could-boris-johnson-lose-his-seat-in-the-next-election">Johnson’s own seat</a> of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.</p><p>Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/16/boris-johnson-comeback-rishi-sunak-prime-minister-labour-tory-mps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bronx River Foodway, the only legal place to forage in New York, celebrates the end of a season</p><p>On a crisp November day in the South Bronx, more than 300 people made their way from Westchester Avenue below the clamor of the 6 train down a tree-lined path leading to Concrete Plant park. This is the home of the Bronx River Foodway, a quarter-acre food forest full of edible, mostly native plants. What looks like a stretch of land dotted with trees appears at first glance to be overrun by weeds, but the wild foliage has been intentionally planted by the Foodway. It is the only legal foraging site in New York City.</p><p>Neighbors young and old poured on to the grassy banks of the Bronx River to celebrate the end of the season and the foliage of the Bronx, including an array of snacks made from foraged ingredients: ginkgo cheese and acorn crackers, and pickled mushrooms and herbal ales made at recent four-part cooking series put on by the Foodway over the last two months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/15/new-york-foraging-bronx-river-foodway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Higher salaries would boost Britain’s economy and bring us in line with many other rich countries</p><p>For almost half a century, in other words within the limits of political memory, Britain has been a country where the priority of most governments has been to keep a few key economic numbers low. Income tax, interest rates, inflation and most people’s wages: all were deliberately suppressed by Downing Street and its collaborators in business and the Bank of England. By doing so a space was created – in theory at least – for certain interest groups to flourish: employers, entrepreneurs, shareholders, top earners, homeowners and consumers. Together, they were supposed to boost our previously sluggish rate of economic growth.</p><p>It hasn’t quite worked out like that. Britain is on the brink of recession yet again. Interest rates, taxes and inflation are all high. Only average wages are still low. And even that dubious achievement of British government and capitalism since the 1980s now feels fragile, with strikes solidifying and spreading across both private and state sectors, determinedly driven by workers who have finally had enough of years of falling pay. As Mick Lynch of the RMT union put it with characteristic pithiness on the Today programme last week: “The price of labour isn’t at the right price in this country.”</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/16/strikes-are-telling-us-something-low-wages-over">Continue reading...</a>

Meanwhile, for the duration of the flight, “Jim is sitting up reading a book that was called something like Is God Dead? I realised that I was not the same kind of human as he is. I mean, the guy is just …” She trails off, grasping for words. “He’s such a <em>marine</em>.”</p><p>People often complain that the age of Hollywood legends is over, but everything about James Cameron always seems to be mythologically huge. Where other movie titans owned fleets of luxury cars, Cameron had not just cars but helicopters and even submarines – which he designed himself and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/26/james-cameron-mariana-trench-dive"> took to the bottom of the ocean</a>. Alongside the militaristic hardware, a myth has formed of Cameron as a fearsome, tough-talking army general of a director, subduing and marshalling his crew on set to the extent they once made T-shirts that read: “You can’t scare me, I work for James Cameron.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/its-got-to-be-an-experience-first-and-foremost-james-cameron-sigourney-weaver-and-kate-winslet-on-the-return-of-avatar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Have you heard the one about the former paratrooper, politician and ‘prince’ who walk into a hunting lodge and allegedly plot to overthrow the German government? Philip Oltermann in Berlin explains why it was no joke</p><p>On 27 November, a video was uploaded on to a website that was popular among far-right conspiracy theorists. It featured a German man with a strong Bavarian accent sitting by the Adriatic Sea and explaining that there was a great, epochal upheaval about to come to Germany. The man in the footage was Maximilian Eder, a former special forces soldier, well trained, with access to weapons.</p><p>The Guardian’s Berlin bureau chief, <strong>Philip Oltermann</strong>, tells <strong>Michael Safi</strong> how this alleged plot to bring down the German government was cooked up and how it came crashing down. The alleged coup failed, but its very existence tells us something about the new power of far-right conspiracies to radicalise people – and not just in Germany.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/dec/16/the-prince-and-the-plot-against-germany-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine defence minister says half of mobilised Russians are being prepared more thoroughly for new offensive in coming months</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year</strong>, Ukraine’s defence minister has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Oleksii Reznikov, said evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/15/ukraine-says-putin-is-preparing-major-offensive-in-new-year">preparing a broad new campaign</a> despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. Referring to Russia’s partial mobilisation of about 300,000 soldiers, Reznikov suggested that while half – often after receiving minimal training – were being used to reinforce Moscow’s forces now, the remainder were being prepared more thoroughly for future offensives.</p><p><strong>The head of Ukraine’s armed forces believes Russia will make a renewed attempt at capturing the capital, Kyiv,</strong> after its previous attack was repelled earlier this year. <a href="https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript">In an interview with the Economist</a>, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny said he was trying to prepare for Russian forces to have another go at taking the city, possibly in February or March.</p><p><strong>Russian shelling killed two people, including a Red Cross worker, in Kherson on Thursday and completely cut power in the southern city</strong>, Ukrainian officials said, with temperatures near freezing. Moscow-allied officials in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, meanwhile, said they had come under some of the heaviest shelling in years from Ukrainian forces, leaving one person dead.</p><p><strong>Russia is to double the number of test launches of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to eight next year</strong> from four in 2022, the commander of strategic rocket forces was quoted as saying on Friday. Sergei Karakayev told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the eight test flights would be scheduled from two launch sites – one near Murmansk in the north, the other near Volgograd in the south.</p><p><strong>A Russian airbase in Kursk was struck on Wednesday night</strong>, a senior Ukrainian official has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a series of updates on Telegram, saying an “unknown drone” struck the military facility.</p><p><strong>The US military announced it would expand training in Germany of Ukrainian military personnel.</strong> Starting in January, 500 troops a month would be trained, building on more than 15,000 Ukrainians trained by the US and its allies since April.</p><p><strong>Electricity blackouts due to Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure are crippling its economy, </strong>including in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/15/ukraine-economy-russia-war-crisis/">report in the Washington Post</a> said Ukraine needed another $2bn a month on top of the $55bn already projected for next year to meet basic expenses.</p><p><strong>An</strong> <strong>€18bn EU finance package for Ukraine looks likely to go ahead after Poland dropped its opposition. </strong>Diplomats from Warsaw had objected to a minimum corporate tax level, which diplomats had told Reuters had “blindsided” those negotiating the deals. They, and Lithuania, had also argued for tighter restrictions on their neighbour Russia.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the next six months of the conflict with Russia will be “decisive”. </strong>In an online address to the European Council on Thursday, Ukraine’s president said: “The next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation Russia started with their aggression.”</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said Russia will try to overcome the financial impact of western sanctions by selling gas to its eastern neighbours. </strong>In a televised speech he said Russia would develop its economic ties with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/16/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-296-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
