Before the massive success of the MCU and the DCEU, the superhero and comic book genre was still trying to find its footing on the big screen. Before Henry Cavill donned the red cape, Brandon Routh played the Man of Steel on the big screen… ever so briefly. 

Superman Returns definitely raises some questions. Like why didn’t Superman tell Lois he was leaving? How did nobody realize that Clark and Superman left and returned on the very same day five years apart? Why did Lex hook up with an old lady, and why he is obsessed with this weird island idea of his? Does kryptonite take away Superman’s powers or not?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Superman Returns!
