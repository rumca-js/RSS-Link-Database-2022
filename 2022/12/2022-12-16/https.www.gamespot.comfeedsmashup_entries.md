<p dir="ltr">Henry Cavill's ousting as Superman from the DC Extended Universe was sudden, though it had been widely reported that James Gunn and Peter Safran would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-confirms-some-reports-about-dc-studios-good-luck-figuring-out-which-ones/1100-6509855/">formalizing their vision for the DC film and TV universe this week</a>. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/why-henry-cavill-is-no-longer-superman-1235283791/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has some of the first insights into what some of these changes will entail--at least for Superman.</p><p dir="ltr">It's already been reported that Superman will be returning in a new movie from Gunn, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">will feature a younger actor in the lead role</a>. But newer revelations include that although Cavill was to further reprise his role as the Man of Steel beyond Black Adam, none of those projects will see the light of day. Those cuts include Cavill's already filmed cameo for The Flash--one of four DC movies set for release in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hollywood Reporter adds that executives met with Cavill to discuss plans. Reportedly, a new role in the DCEU is being explored for the actor. Gunn and Safran have also reportedly have talked to Ben Affleck (who is out as Batman) and Jason Momoa (who may be out as Aquaman) to explore possibilities in new roles or stepping into the director's chair on future projects.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavills-superman-cut-from-the-flash-report/1100-6510142/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">For retro gaming fans who love physical media but are gobsmacked by the price of old carts, the Evercade brand has fulfilled a nostalgic dream over the past two-plus years. With a pick-up-and-play mentality, a growing library of carts filled with officially licensed retro console and arcade games, and multiple hardware iterations, the Evercade has found its niche in an increasingly popular market. The Evercade EXP, an updated version of the original handheld, is the best Evercade yet. If you're interested in 8- and 16-bit console and arcade games, the Evercade EXP offers a fantastic way to play physical cartridge collections in a portable form factor.</p><div class="norewrite" title="6510138 - Evercade EXP Review">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4078541-evercade-exp-packaging_front_pegi-120922.jpg" />                                 <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-evercade-exp-handheld/6520020.p?skuId=6520020"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-evercade-exp-handheld/6520020.p?skuId=6520020">Evercade EXP</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-evercade-exp-handheld/6520020.p?skuId=6520020">$150</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-evercade-exp-handheld/6520020.p?skuId=6520020">See at Best Buy</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><p dir="ltr">For those who are unfamiliar with the Evercade, it first debuted in 2020 as a budget-friendly handheld with cartridge play. Each cartridge, which goes for $20 a pop, has a collection of authentic classic games. There are collections based on old platforms like the Atari Lynx and Commodore 64 as well as publisher-themed carts from studios such as Data East, Interplay, Codemasters, and more. Just like the old days, the carts come in chunky plastic cases filled with cool inserts. You insert the cartridge, pick a game, and dive in almost instantly. Quality-of-life improvements such as save states and various display settings make these retro games more digestible, lending themselves to quick spurts of play.</p><p dir="ltr">The original handheld was followed up in 2021 by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-vs-review-joyous-nostalgia/1100-6499914/">Evercade VS</a>, a home console capable of 1080p resolution and multiplayer for two players. With the EXP, manufacturer Blaze Entertainment has returned to its handheld origins, improving on the original design in practically every way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-review-retro-bliss-reborn/1100-6510138/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## All 19 Netflix TV Shows Canceled In 2022 (So Far)

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3957706-dek.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Each year, we're forced to say some painful goodbyes. It happens without fail, a new slew of TV shows are canceled, some beloved, others less so. Some shows go away without getting a proper ending to their story, while others get a planned conclusion that won't leave us hanging. Once upon a time, it was surprising to see streaming service giant Netflix adding shows to the list, but those days have come and gone.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, Netflix cancels a decently long list of shows practically every year. While many of them didn't get past the first season or two, there are also long-running shows that meet their end because, well, TV shows simply can't go on forever. After all, the kids on Stranger Things aren't exactly kids anymore. How much longer could Netflix have realistically expected to see them run around Hawkins chasing monsters?</p><p>With that in mind, we're taking a look at every show Netflix has canceled this year. Thankfully, we're getting the satisfaction of some of these shows playing out in full (and they may not even technically end this year, depending on how release schedules play out). Others, though, are simply gone too soon. After you've made it through this list, make sure to check out our recap of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-26-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022-so-far/2900-3928/">every show canceled across the network and streaming landscape this year</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

## Donald Glover To Star In Spider-Man Universe Movie Based On Hypno-Hustler - Report

<p dir="ltr">Donald Glover (Atlanta, Community) will star and produce in an upcoming Spider-Man movie, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/donald-glover-to-star-in-spider-man-movie-hypno-hustler-1235283667/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Citing unnamed sources, the writer-actor will be joining forces with screenwriter Myles Murphy.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie has no title but is said to center on the Hypno-Hustler, a relatively obscure and minor villain in the Spider-Man universe. The character--whose secret identity is Antoine Delsoin--is an evil singer with hypnotic technology who is aided by his band the Mercy Killers to rob crowds, generally cause mayhem, and eventually face down against Spider-Man. After making his debut in 1978, the character has largely been relegated to minor cameos or references in comics and video games.</p><p dir="ltr">According to The Hollywood Reporter, Glover appreciated "the musical aspect" of the character and "the fact that he has less Marvel canon baggage, freeing him to greater interpretations." However, there is no solid information yet on what shape or tone the project might have--sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the movie could be "anything from a disco period piece to a re-imagined modern hip-hop version or even a cyberpunk future play." Murphy reportedly had an angle on the character that excited Glover to get onboard.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donald-glover-to-star-in-spider-man-universe-movie-based-on-hypno-hustler-report/1100-6510140/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Marvel Snap, the mobile Marvel digital card game, released on October 18. Ahead of the holidays and new year, more details about what players can expect from Marvel Snap was released in a <a href="https://www.marvelsnap.com/newsdetail?id=7170991127032568582">roadmap</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The roadmap is split into three sections: "coming soon," "in development," and "in concept." Coming soon means features under this category will be launched in the near future. Battle Mode Vs. Friends is one such update, and it's been highly anticipated <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/11/03/marvel-snap-play-against-friends-battle-mode/">since November's tease</a>. Currently, there's no way to play against your friends and Battle Mode Vs. Friends rectifies that. But Battle Mode will be different from the standard Ranked matches. Each player will have 10 bars of health and Snaps double damage done to the opponent's health. For example, if you Snap, then the damage is doubled from two to four. If you retreat, damage received is halved from two to one. Players keep playing matches until one of them loses all health.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still no confirmed release date, but the dev team plans to release Battle Mode Vs.

<p dir="ltr">December is already half gone, and January is not far away. A new month ahead also means a whole new slate of shows and movies to watch on Hulu. Some of that content will be available on January 1, while other shows and movies will be available a little later next month.</p><p dir="ltr">If awkward and dark comedies are your thing, you should consider The Drop on January 13. The movie, coming from producers Jay and Mark Duplass, stars Anna Konkle (Pen15). A trip to a tropical island resort for a friend's destination wedding goes horribly awry after couple lex and Mani, shortly after arriving, drop her friend's baby in front of all their friends. Things only go downhill from there. The Drop is directed by Sarah Adina Smith and is co-written by Smith and Joshua Leonard. In addition to Konkle, the film's cast includes Jermaine Fowler (Coming 2 America), Jillian Bell (Brittany Run a Marathon), Utkarsh Ambudkar (Free Guy), Robin Thede (A Black Lady Sketch Show), Aparna Nancherla (Crashing), Joshua Leonard (The Blair Witch Project), Jennifer Lafleur (Nope), and Elisha Henig (The Sinner).</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"><span>Later in the month, Season 2 of How I Met Your Father comes to Hulu on January 24. The 20-episode season continues the reboot pretty much exactly a full year after Season 1 came to the streaming service earlier this year. The offshoot picks up eight years after the events of the How I Met Your Mother finale, focusing on a new friend group consisting of Sophie (Younger's Hilary Duff), Charlie (The Royals' Tom Ainsley), Jesse (Veronica Mars' Chris Lowell), Valentina (Grown-ish's Francia Raisa), Ellen (Space Force‘s Tien Tran) and Sid (God Friended Me's Suraj Sharma). The story is told from 58-year-old Sophie's perspective, and out of the gate confirms she's already met the father, which means the series works slightly differently than its predecessor.</span></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-hulu-in-january-2023-how-i-met-your-father-season-2-the-drop/1100-6510137/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Marvel Snap Decks - Best Pool 3 Decks

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>’s Pool 3 has the largest number of cards of all current pools, and it can be daunting to figure out what works well in tandem or what win conditions you should be in tune with. These cards are unlocked from <strong>Collection Level 486 and onwards</strong>. This guide will detail some of the best Marvel Snap decks and tactics you can implement that will have you ascend the ranks and become victorious against your opponents using all <strong>Pool 3 decks</strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Discardian Dissonance</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Discardian Dissonance is similar to our previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-pool-2-decks/1100-6509074/">Marvel Snap Pool 2</a> deck Discardian Discord. This time, it has been greatly improved due to Pool 3 adding additional cards with discard effects such as Colleen Wing, Moon Knight, Gambit, Dracula, and Hell Cow to name a few. This deck does not have any 1-Cost cards and is not supposed to with our win conditions.</p><p dir="ltr">Colleen Wing will always discard the lowest-cost card in your hand, so make sure she discards Swarm most often. Swarm will create two copies of itself, both being 0-Cost. Turn 3, you will want to play Lockjaw, then place those two Swarm copies you created the last turn on its location. This will swap out those two 0-Cost Swarm copies for something much better such as Moon Knight to discard a card from your opponent, Apocalypse, or even America Chavez.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-pool-3-decks/1100-6510135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft </a>players in China may have to take the fate of their characters into their own hands, with Blizzard announcing it will allow Chinese players to download their characters ahead of an imminent shutdown of Blizzard game services in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">It was announced in late November that Blizzard could not come to a mutually-satisfactory deal with China's NetEase, which has long served as the distributor of various Blizzard games, including WoW, in the region.

In the meantime, Blizzard will move forward with the unusual move of developing a feature that will allow Chinese players to download and save all of their characters, items, and progress in Blizzard's MMO onto their own personal devices, to be used at some future point when WoW becomes available in China once more under a new distribution partner.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-in-china-will-be-allowed-to-download-their-character-data-ahead-of-shutdown/1100-6510132/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Disney is reporting that Thursday night previews for Avatar: The Way of Water took in $17 million. <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/avatar-the-way-of-water-box-office-1235200714/">Deadline</a> was first to report, adding that the foreign total from 44 markets--not including China--is around $50.4 million.</p><p dir="ltr">Reviews for the film have so far been mixed--many critics who disliked the first were surprised to find James Cameron's follow-up engaging, but there are just as many who had an opposite reaction. In GameSpot's review, Mason Downey thought the film had incredibly beautiful shots, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-dead-in-the-water/1900-6418013/">failed to live up to its legacy as a bleeding edge spectacle</a>.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is kicking off its third major anime crossover today with the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-x-my-hero-academia-event-skins-mythic-weapon-and-a-lot-more/1100-6510111/">My Hero Academia (MHA) content coming to the game</a>. After having what seemed to be massive success with Naruto and Dragon Ball, Epic's battle royale and creative suite is taking on the My Hero series in a similarly major way. Alongside four in-game skins, an incredibly powerful new Mythic weapon called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-and-my-hero-academia-how-to-get-dekus-smash-mythic-weapon/1100-6510116/">Deku's Smash</a>, and in-game challenges, one of the best parts of the crossover is the new game mode, Hero Training Gym. The game mode was made in Fortnite Creative by <a href="https://twitter.com/ZenCreateGG">Zen Creative</a>, a sibling-founded studio that specializes in making custom experiences inside Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to GameSpot while we ran around his My Hero Academia PvP mode together, co-founder R-leeo Maoate explained how the team made a name for itself in the Fortnite Creative space and what other dream projects the team at Zen Creative hopes to work on in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">"Back in April we did the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZt5foFpvEk">Soundwave Series for Emicida</a>, a Brazilian rapper," he said.

<p dir="ltr">Warner Bros. has offered a first look at Barbie's world with a teaser trailer for the Margot Robbie-starring film. The video starts by making quite a bold claim: "Since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls."</p><p dir="ltr">Barbie, though, apparently broke the mold of them always being baby dolls. This prehistoric intro riffs on Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and may or may not give us an idea of the tongue-in-cheek tone of the movie. Afterward it gives way to a collage of scenes from the film. For instance, the teaser trailer shows that Barbie does appear to inhabit a bright, pink plastic world. We also see Ken (Ryan Gosling) engaged in some sort of physical sport--wearing quite the black ensemble with headband--and Issa Rae's unknown character in a president sash fist-pumping.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Simu Liu, star of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is spotted doing quite the dance number in the teaser trailer. And then the video ends with Robbie's Barbie also busting a move. Other cast members for the film include America Ferrera, Alexandra Shipp, Will Ferrell, and Michael Cera.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-barbie-teaser-trailer-shows-theres-one-doll-to-rule-them-all/1100-6510127/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

While none of these would be generally considered in the first rank of classic Sega Genesis games, all of them are solid names that are definitely worth a look for Expansion Pack subscribers.

## The Worst Movies Of The Year, According To Metacritic

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078175-worstmetacritic.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There were lots of great movies in 2022, which you probably saw listed in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-movies-of-the-year-according-to-metacritic/2900-4015/">Best Movies of 2022, According to Metacritic</a> piece. However, not every movie can be Mr. Bachman and His Class, as not every movie is looking to be that. Most films just want to entertain the masses for a couple of hours, to get your mind off of the daily grind. And while many movie achieved that, there were quite a few stinkers released over the course of the year. But what were the worst movies of 2022?</p><p dir="ltr">Within the past year, over 500 feature-length movies released with at least seven critic reviews on Metacritic. Obviously, it can be hard to keep up with all of films that came out, good or bad, unless something ended up going viral, even if it's for all the wrong reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">While many of us got caught up in "Morbin' time" with Jared Leto's Marvel vampire movie Morbius--again, not good--there were plenty of movies both fans and critics did not like. So looking over at GameSpot's sister site Metacritic--a review aggregate giving critic's reviews a score between 1-100--we're figuring out what the worst reviewed movies of the year are.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, you'll find a few movies that were quietly released on streaming services and a few others you may not have heard of. The one thing they all have in common is that the majority of critics that reviewed them didn't like them. Looking at the site, we found the 10 worst critically-reviewed movies on Metacritic and have them presented in a list for you below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. The Bubble</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078182-bubble.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: April 1</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bubble-2022">34 (34 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">A star-studded cast. A renowned director. A brilliant comedic writer. The Bubble has all the makings of a classic comedy, but it's actually terrible. The Netflix movie directed by Judd Apatow follows a film set during the pandemic, as the group tries to make an action movie about killing dinosaurs. Maybe the poor reception is because people don't want to be reminded of the pandemic we currently live in with the backdrop of spoiled celebrities and many inside baseball jokes about filmmaking, because it certainly hits all the same beats as other of Apatow's movies--along with a bunch of people doing TikTok dances. Sadly, this film falls so flat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Redeeming Love</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078183-redeeming.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: January 21</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/redeeming-love">32 (7 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">During the California Gold Rush of 1850, a young couple is in love and their relationship is tested by the world they live in. Critics describe it as a bad Hallmark movie with a large pinch of religion. If you watch the trailer, it's a lot of people looking at each other, longing for love.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Firestarter</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3999069-fire.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Release: May 13</p><p>Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/firestarter-2022">32 (29 reviews)</a></p><p>The Peacock reimaging of Stephen King's novel follows a parents on the run with their daughter Charlie from the government because she has the ability to create and control fire. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. The King's Daughter</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078184-kings.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: January 21</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-kings-daughter">31 (18 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">Get ready for a wild ride. Pierce Brosnan stars as King Louis XIV, who is looking for a way to become immortal, so he captures a mermaid. He's planning on stealing its lifeforce but it becomes friends with his daughter. This movie began production in Versailles, France in 2014 and was titled The Moon and The Sun. It was going to be released in April 2015, but its release was canceled. The movie was retitled The King's Daughter and released in 2022. The journey to get this title released is much more interesting than the film itself.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Big Gold Brick</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078185-biggold.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: February 25</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/big-gold-brick">30 (12 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">Brian Pestsos' dark comedy follows Samuel Liston (Emory Cohen), who is enlisted to write the biography of Floyd Devereaux (Andy Garcia). However, the task to do so becomes tough as chaos ensues. Critics have described the film as trying too hard to be dark and quirky, and that the film comes off as bland.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. The School For Good And Evil</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078167-school.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Release: October 19</p><p>Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-school-for-good-and-evil">30 (17 reviews)</a></p><p>In this Netflix original--a term that appears a few times on this list--two best friends enter an enchanted school where people are trained in forces both good and evil in order to maintain balance. It's a modern fairy tale with a star-studded cast (Cate Blanchett, Charlize Theron, Ben Kingsley, Kerry Washington) that falls exceptionally flat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Mother Schmuckers</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078186-mother.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: March 4</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mother-schmuckers">28 (9 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">Coming in at a rip-roaring 70 minutes, Mother Schmuckers is about two brothers who live with their mother and lose her dog. It's the French version of Dude, Where's My Car? but the jokes are all way over-the-top, trying to offend its audience. Dude, Where's My Edgelord? The trailer opens up with the brothers cooking poo and ends with someone farting in another person's face, so at least the movie never attempts to hide what it is.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Blacklight</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078187-blacklight.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: February 11</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blacklight">27 (22 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">Liam Neeson stars in Blacklight as a government operative with a dark past. What separates this from Neeson's previous work, like Taken, is that the actor's character is up against the FBI, which has been killing US citizens. Regardless, Neeson's character does have a particular set of skills in this movie. However, critics have described it as another clunky thriller.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Me Time</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4046669-metime.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Release: August 26</p><p>Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/me-time">25 (19 reviews)</a></p><p>In this Netflix movie, two stay-at-home dads take a vacation from their wives and kids and have a wild weekend.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Asking For It</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4078188-asking.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Release: March 4</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/asking-for-it">20 (7 reviews)</a></p><p dir="ltr">This thriller follows a waitress who is sexually assaulted and meets a group of vigilante women who come together to take down corrupt men in power. Critics have said this movie lacks depth and is a paint-by-numbers revenge movie. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/movies/asking-for-it-review.html">Jeannette Catsoulis of the New York Times</a> said Asking For It is as "subtle as a sledgehammer and shallow as a saucer."</p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">My Hero Academia has arrived in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>, and over the next two weeks, it's going to have a huge impact on how you play. That's because this collab isn't just about item shop cosmetics--though it certainly does have those. But on top of that, the island is now home to a new MHA-themed Mythic weapon: Deku's Smash.</p><p dir="ltr">Deku's Smash is just as big of a shift to the Fortnite meta <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dragon-ball-where-to-find-kamehameha-nimbus-cloud-and-capsules/1100-6506510/">as the Kamehameha was during the Dragonball collaboration this past summer.</a> This is to say you should expect things to blow up a lot more during the next two weeks, as players will no doubt be constantly throwing this thing around.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What actually is the Deku's Smash mythic weapon?</h2><p dir="ltr">Remember how the Kamehameha was basically a giant laser that would melt anything that you pointed it at--provided you could survive the lengthy charge-up time?

<p>The wait is finally over, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s collaboration with My Hero Academia has just made this year's Winterfest celebration a lot more interesting. Just as we saw during past collaborations with Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, Fortnite x My Hero Academia is more than just a few new skins in the item shop. On top of the four new outfits and accompanying cosmetic sets, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-x-my-hero-academia-how-to-get-the-new-dekus-smash-mythic/1100-6510116/">Deku's Smash mythic</a> will be wreaking all sorts of havoc in Battle Royale, and you can earn some free cosmetics through quests that you can do in Battle Royale and the new My Hero Academia Creative island.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dragon-ball-where-to-find-kamehameha-nimbus-cloud-and-capsules/1100-6506510/">Dragonball Kamehameha</a> from this past summer, Deku's Smash is a potential game-changer whenever someone uses it.

<p>After 25 years, the Pokemon anime series is shaking up its formula by saying goodbye to Ash and Pikachu. The new Pokemon series that is set to debut in 2023, once Pokemon Ultimate Journeys: The Series concludes, will star two new protagonists named Riko and Roy. The new show will also see the three Paldea starter Pokemon, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly, join the duo on their journey.</p><div>          </div><p> </p><p>Ash and Pikachu's departure makes sense, as the pair finally reached the apex of the Pokemon world earlier this year during the World Coronation Series Masters Eight Tournament.

## The 5 Best PlayStation Exclusives Of 2022

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075476-img_3873.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to exclusives, no one is doing it quite like PlayStation. For years, the console has had a strong claim as the destination for narrative-driven exclusives, and for good reason. From Bloodborne and Team Ico's projects to the action-packed Uncharted and the heart-wrenching The Last of Us, PlayStation maintains an impressive collection of critically-acclaimed titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2022, PlayStation doubled-down on this reputation, with several first-party studios releasing exclusives for Sony's consoles including long-awaited sequels to celebrated series like Horizon and God of War. However, these blockbuster adventures aren't the only games that graced PlayStation this year. 2022 also saw an emergence of new titles from smaller studios with larger-than-life ideas. So, from the sunny California coasts of Horizon Forbidden West to the neon-lit underground of Stray, here are the five best adventures PS4 and PS5 took us on in 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, and one last note: Please bear in mind, this list might contain a few games available to play on PC as well, which frankly we're pretty thankful about--no one should miss out on games this good! However, when it comes to consoles, these titles are locked to PlayStation or, in our opinion, are best experienced there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>God of War Ragnarök</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075289-3979215-gowragnarok.jpg" /><br /><em>Kratos awaits Atreus in a cave.</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">While 2018's God of War tells the tale of a man truly becoming a father, God of War Ragnarök explores perhaps an even more difficult topic: How the father-son dynamic is completely altered as a child grows into a young adult. Following the events of God of War, Kratos has seemingly fully embraced fatherhood, but with it comes a profound sense of vulnerability--one that Atreus can't help but notice. This leads to a series of communication breakdowns as both men fight to be the other's protector--as they strive to be independent forces, each terrified of the other's strength and fragility.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a compelling story, beautifully told whilst Ragnarök's brutal Fimbulwinter begins to consume the land these men once called home. But while the stakes and emotions are high, it doesn't stop God of War Ragnarök from being every bit as delightful to play as its predecessor. With fluid combat, stunning visuals, plenty of system improvements, and an overall greater sense of both power and scale, God of War Ragnarök is a must-play for PlayStation owners.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/">God of War Ragnar</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/">ö</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/">k review</a>, we gave the game 9/10. "Despite being a story about warring gods and the end of the world, the soul of the game is something far more sentimental," Tamoor Hussain wrote. "For every moment of brutality, there is one of genuine and relatable emotion. How they land will vary from person to person, but there were multiple that left me with tears welling up. If nothing else, God of War Ragnarök further cements Sony Santa Monica's narrative team as one of the best in the business."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Horizon Forbidden West</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075285-3920324-3918930-horizonforbiddenwest%283%29.jpg" /><br /><em>Aloy takes on new mechanical foes in Horizon Forbidden West.</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Aloy returns in the follow up to 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn in this year's Horizon Forbidden West. Whereas Zero Dawn saw the fierce hunter traverse a Southwest devoid of civilization as we know it and reclaimed by nature, Forbidden West takes her on a journey to the golden coasts of California. However, the setting isn't the only thing that's shaken up in Aloy's sophomore adventure. Everything in Forbidden West is greater in scale--the maps, the skill trees, the weapon choices, the sense of adventure… Oh, and quite naturally, the giant robotic dinosaurs and beasts you must strategically hunt and scavenge for parts.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, this upscaling can be a bit overwhelming. Between new weapons, traps, and unprecedented mobility, Aloy requires more coordination and careful planning than ever to take down her prey. However, this also means encounters are ultimately more tense and exciting than ever before. Where Forbidden West truly shines, though, is in its story and characters. While Zero Dawn focused largely on connecting with figures from the past, Forbidden West is grounded in the present and focused on building relationships with a cast of colorful characters, each with their own motivations and backstories. This level of detail is even extended to minor characters who show up in side quests, and help make the game feel curated and heartfelt.</p><p>GameSpot gave the game 8/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review/1900-6417826/">Horizon Forbidden West review</a>. "When its many systems come together, it can be a beautiful, exciting, and delightful open-world experience," Phil Hornshaw wrote. "The story that drives you through the frontier is often well-told and does well to center actual characters rather than audio logs, and while the map is littered with icons, it's much more often that they're fun, skillfully crafted diversions than random busywork to fill a checklist."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Last of Us Part I</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075286-4074205-thelastofus.jpg" /><br /><em>Ellie from The Last of Us.</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">To call The Last of Us Part I a mere remaster of its 2013 counterpart would be a disservice. While the game might see Joel and Ellie experience the same harrowing sequence of events as The Last of Us--and still make the same choices that will inevitably lead to the same shocking conclusions--never has the terror and heartache been as palpable as it is in The Last of Us Part I.</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Part I's visual overhaul does not solely exist to make the game more palatable in 2022 or ring in a new audience of folks who never played the game but are eager to after seeing the trailers for its HBO adaptation, though it accomplishes both tasks with ease. It also helps players forge a stronger connection between their world and the world of The Last of Us, a connection that inspires empathy, as well as makes Joel and Ellie more human than ever before. Thanks to better character animation, every expression is more intricate and impactful and every glance has greater weight. The environments are more foreboding and lonely, as improved lighting showcases every speck of dust in the air and adds more terror to the game's dark recesses. Beyond that, The Last of Us Part 1 also tightens the game's combat and adds a plethora of options that make the title more accessible and fun to play than ever before. Quite simply, it's the definitive way to experience this beloved PlayStation experience.</p><p>GameSpot gave an 8/10 to The Last of Us Part I in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/">review</a>. "All these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better," Jake Dekker wrote. "While some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sifu</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075288-3871700-sifu.jpg" /><br /><em>The Sifu's son prepares to fight a man in a nightclub.</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who has practiced martial arts--or has watched their fair share of Kung Fu cinema--understands that to become truly great takes incredible discipline and both devotion and respect for the art form and its principles. Sifu hones in on this idea, posing the question of, "Can one person truly master Kung Fu in their lifetime?" before allowing players to come to the conclusion on their own.</p><p dir="ltr">Sifu is a relentlessly challenging brawler that sees your character take on an elite group of fighters after they assassinate their father. However, this isn't your standard revenge story, as each time your character fails they grow older. And while their mind might grow wiser after these defeats, their body becomes more frail. Inevitably, your character can die from old age having not completed his quest for vengeance. Discipline and precision is vital to ensuring that doesn't happen, but it's no easy feat, which is precisely what makes Sifu so compelling.</p><p>Sifu received a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sifu-review-i-know-kung-fu/1900-6417823/">review</a>, with Richard Wakeling writing, "Your journey from student to master is thrilling, mainly because it's governed by your own improving skill level rather than traditional character progression. There are memorable moments that stand out throughout, such as the boss fights and an enjoyable recreation of the iconic hallway scene from Oldboy, but it's Sifu's combat that shines through most brightly."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stray</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4075287-4005791-6641528569-40031.jpg" /><br /><em>The titular stray cat.</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of if you're a cat person, dog lover, snake enthusiast, or perhaps even an avid bird watcher, Stray's charm is undeniable. From its opening moments--when your feline protagonist loses their balance and is sent plummeting away from their companions and down into an underground city occupied by neon-lights and androids--to the game's hopeful conclusion, every bit of Stray is filled to the brim with emotion and heart. The game also, and perhaps surprisingly due to its protagonist and supporting cast, touches on what it means to be alive and the importance of companionship.</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from that, Stray is also a blast to play. Filled with puzzles that require not only cat-like reflexes but cat-like thinking as well, you'll be tasked with walking across keyboards, pushing objects off high surfaces, and getting up to all the usual mischief that makes cats so endearing. Add gorgeous visuals, a splash of horror, and smooth platforming, and you've got one impressive first game from the up-and-coming BlueTwelve Studio.</p><p>Ultimately, this game received a 9/10 from GameSpot. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-review-nine-lives/1900-6417917/">Stray review</a>, Alessandro Barbosa wrote, "Stray's ultimate strength is how well its overall design embodies the unique perspective and capabilities of its protagonist, but it also doesn't rely on this to be the only distinguishing feature of the entire adventure. A lot of the enjoyment throughout Stray's runtime comes from how well each scenario is designed for the abilities of its feline hero."</p></h3></p><br />

<p> It's been a hell of a week for Henry Cavill, who announced he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">wouldn't be returning to the role of Superman</a>, with reports he also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-will-not-return-as-geralt-of-rivia-despite-superman-departure/1100-6510110/">would not be returning to his previous role</a> in Netflix's Witcher series. It seems another nerdy franchise is on the horizon for Cavill, with the actor attached to star in and executive produce a TV adaptation of Warhammer 40K for Amazon, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/henry-cavill-warhammer-40000-amazon-1235283251/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>No other names are attached to the project at present, and with Amazon still in talks to acquire the rights to the tabletop franchise, it's likely it will be a while before the series makes it to production. Amazon is reportedly finalising the rights deal with Games Workshop after months of negotiation and competition from rival companies.</p><p>Warhammer 40K is a tabletop game that takes place in a dark, dystopian setting, 40,000 years in the future. The game features multiple factions--including the humans' Imperium of Man, the elven Aeldari, skeletal androids called Necron, and alien races including Orks, Tyranids, and the T'au--who are all locked in a brutal and neverending war.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-reportedly-attached-to-warhammer-40k-series-for-amazon/1100-6510114/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">When I booted up High On Life for the first time, I knew what I was getting myself into. I'm familiar with the work of not only Justin Roiland (Rick and Morty, Solar Opposites) but also of his game studio Squanch Games (Trover Saves The Universe, Accounting+), so I had an idea of the sort of comedy that was coming my way. What I did not expect, however, was a 3D shooter with Metroidvania vibes that echo some of the best games of my youth, and more importantly does them justice.</p><p dir="ltr">High On Life tells the story of an unnamed protagonist--whom everyone calls "Bounty Hunter," even their own sister--fighting against an alien drug cartel that's invaded Earth. The cartel wishes to round up every human on the planet and sell them as the drug, which other aliens can consume via elaborate machines. Our bounty hunter hero is armed with Gatlians, a race of talking guns, and each Gatlian possesses its own attacks and abilities. The concept is admittedly very weird, but it's a well-told story that kept me guessing until the end.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point, it bears acknowledging that this is 100% a Justin Roiland project, complete with all the hallmarks of his comedic philosophy. Rapid-fire monologues, fart jokes, demolition of the fourth wall, ad-libs, dark comedy--it's all intertwined within the game's narrative and presentation. If things like Rick and Morty, Trover Saves The Universe, or Solar Opposites aren't your cup of tea, this won't be either. That said, I have a very high tolerance for this sort of goofiness and I found myself laughing throughout the 10-hour adventure.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/high-on-life-review-talking-heads/1900-6418014/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
