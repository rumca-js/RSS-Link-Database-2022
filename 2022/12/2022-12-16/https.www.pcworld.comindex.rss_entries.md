<p>The portable powerhouse that is the Steam Deck was easily the biggest gaming hardware story of the year (and a deserving <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430365/the-full-nerd-awards-our-favorite-pc-hardware-of-2022.html">Full Nerd award winner</a>). Now that Valve has nailed down its production issues, it&rsquo;s looking at improving the hardware that goes out the door &mdash; and working on the next generation, of course. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917883/valves-steam-deck-2-is-already-in-the-works.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">We know the Steam Deck 2 is happening</a>, something that wasn&rsquo;t a given at the start of the year. But a new interview has shed some light on exactly what Valve wants to achieve with a new hardware revision. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022?s=31&amp;xcust=2-1-1438078-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Speaking to The Verge</a>, Valve engineers Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais offered a few critical peeks into the future of the current Steam Deck and exactly what the company wants out of a new machine. The whole lengthy piece is worth a read if you want to get into the nuts and bolts. But here are five critical take-aways if you&rsquo;re short on time: </p>



<p><strong>New Steam Decks are shipping with a less-noisy fan</strong>. We&rsquo;ve covered this before: Early Steam Deck models came with exhaust fans supplied from two separate vendors, one of which was a lot louder than the other. Valve is still using components from both Huaying and Delta, but a bit of sound-absorbing foam seems to have addressed the noise issue. You can still order the Huaying fan (the less-noisy one) from iFixit &mdash; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1369318/how-to-swap-out-the-steam-decks-noisy-fan.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">check out our how-to video</a> for more info. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Valve is open to making a new Steam Controller</strong>. The Steam Deck is, in many ways, a natural evolution of Valve&rsquo;s previous and less-successful hardware ventures: the Steam Link and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423965/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-opening-a-new-world-of-pc-gaming-possibilities.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller</a>. The latter&rsquo;s haptic touchpads and highly-customizable controls are an integral part of the Steam Deck. According to Yang, Valve is interested in a new Steam Controller, if not necessarily committed to one at the moment. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s likely that we&rsquo;ll explore that because it&rsquo;s something we wanted as well.&rdquo; An official Valve controller, or a licensed third-party option beyond the usual Xbox and PlayStation designs, would be an obvious boon to the Steam Deck&rsquo;s docked experience. </p>



<p><strong>A Steam Deck audio mixer is coming</strong>. Gamers on Windows often rely on the OS&rsquo;s ability to control volume for programs independently. At the moment the Steam Deck can&rsquo;t do that, unless a specific game offers volume controls in its own settings menu. But it&rsquo;s coming in the near future. The software team is working on tweaks to the Linux-based software to make it work, though adding a custom user interface will be a big part of that. </p>



<p><strong>Mobile games might come to the Steam Deck</strong>. There are plenty of high-profile mobile games that eventually create a PC version, but the Steam Deck is a natural fit for pretty much any game designed for a horizontal touchscreen. According to Griffais, mobile developers have expressed an interest in publishing their games directly to Steam and the Steam Deck. Valve is open to the idea, so long as touchscreen-only games are clearly labeled as such. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Angry Birds" class="wp-image-1438110" height="685" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-deck-angry-birds.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Valve</p></div>



<p><strong>The Steam Deck 2 will have a better screen and battery</strong>. The Nintendo Switch has had two major hardware revisions since launch: a SKU-only update that boosted battery life, and a new model with an OLED screen. Valve is looking to address both of those points in a next-gen Steam Deck. Exactly what those improvements would look like &mdash; A new high-refresh screen panel? A physically larger case to fit a bigger battery? &mdash; weren&rsquo;t commented upon. </p>



<p>Surprisingly, the engineers downplayed any possible improvements to the Steam Deck&rsquo;s power or performance in the short term, despite the upcoming revisions in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 3 mobile graphics</a>. Apparently keeping all its users on a similar level of hardware power, game console-style, is a valuable asset for developers. Reading between the lines, that does mean that any changes made to the hardware for the next generation probably won&rsquo;t result in a huge price increase, keeping one of the Steam Deck&rsquo;s most attractive features intact: its affordability. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck with rear casing removed" class="wp-image-1438112" height="611" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-deck-battery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/IDG</p></div>



<p>At the moment Valve is selling every Steam Deck it can make, and then some, and players seem more than satisfied with it in general. That means that any major updates to the hardware are a long way off. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect a second-gen Steam Deck, or even a mildly improved model, to hit the market in less than six months. A year or more out from this point is, frankly, a lot more likely. We have some other suggestions for what we want in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917673/steam-deck-2-wishlist-what-we-want-from-valves-next-gen-handheld.html">next-gen Steam Deck</a>. </p>

It&rsquo;s a good option for low- to mid-level builds, and for most users it&rsquo;ll pair perfectly fine with a midrange Ryzen 7000 CPU. It might not have all of the bells and whistles of premium next-gen boards, but gamers and content creators who don&rsquo;t want to shell out a small fortune will find a lot to like here.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re stepping into AMD&rsquo;s AM5 Ryzen 7000 CPUs, you&rsquo;ll want a competent motherboard to accompany you. With platform costs always being a concern with a new entry, finding good values are essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where the Asus Prime X670-P comes in. This standard X670 offering will have a few PCIe lane compromises, but if you don&rsquo;t need more than one PCIe Gen 5 lane, it likely won&rsquo;t affect you much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where you&rsquo;ll see a more noticeable effect is in the price: With an MSRP of $299, it&rsquo;s a much more attractive entry point for this next-generation chipset. DDR5 and AMD&rsquo;s fastest CPUs are all supported here, letting you have your cake and eat it too!&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a minimalist design and focused feature set, there&rsquo;s a lot to like. We&rsquo;ll look at the specs, features, design, and performance. Is this the balanced motherboard that your build deserves? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="asus-prime-x670-p-the-specs">Asus Prime X670-P: The specs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Prime X670-P" class="wp-image-1430044" height="622" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-19-at-4.16.20-PM-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus Prime X670-P comes with 10 USB ports, but we wish at least some of them would be USB 4.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus Prime X670-P comes with AM5&rsquo;s X670 chipset offering. Compared to the &ldquo;Extreme&rdquo; X670E, the standard X670 grants you only a single PCIe Gen 5 slot for storage. (Everything else is Gen 4 and below.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can still use the same CPUs from AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 lineup, including the beefy Ryzen 9 7950X. iGPU is standard with the new CPUs out of the box as well, which is very handy for diagnostics without a discrete GPU.</p>



<p>The unboxing experience is plain and standard, as befits the $299 MSRP. You&rsquo;ll get a few accessories, such as SATA cables, but nothing like on more premium motherboards. (No M.2 PCIe cards or other trinkets.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>No Wi-Fi antenna either, since this board does not support it. (You&rsquo;ll need the X670-P Wi-Fi for that).</p>



<ul><li>ATX form factor&nbsp;</li><li>Support for Ryzen 7000 CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>12+2 DrMos power stages&nbsp;</li><li>DDR5 RAM, dual channel up to 4 DIMMs 128GB</li><li>3x onboard M.2 slots with Q-Latch (1x PCIe Gen 5)&nbsp;</li><li>HDMI and DisplayPort out&nbsp;</li><li>10 USB ports on back</li><li>Realtek 2.5GbE LAN</li><li>RGB headers</li><li>6 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>6 PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>BIOS Flashback</li><li>Realtek 7.1 Audio&nbsp;</li><li>MSRP $299</li></ul>



<h2 id="asus-prime-x670-p-features">Asus Prime X670-P: Features</h2>



<p>$299 MSRP is not what we&rsquo;d historically call a budget offering, but in today&rsquo;s environment, it&rsquo;s a competitive price for X670.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do the features stack up for the price? It&rsquo;s a nice balanced mix for both gamers and content creators who don&rsquo;t want to break the bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, you&rsquo;ll get support for DDR5 and Ryzen 7000 CPUs. Of course, you likely won&rsquo;t be able to push overclock limits as you would on something like an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1385986/asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-motherboard-review.html">Asus X670E Hero we reviewed</a>, but it will do fine for most users.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Prime X670-P" class="wp-image-1430055" height="841" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-19-at-4.18.17-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;re missing Wi-Fi here, but there is a Wi-Fi version available&mdash;our preference would be that there is only one version to limit confusion for consumers. (Wi-Fi should now be standard at this price level).</p>



<p>As mentioned, X670 does allow you access to a PCIe Gen 5 slot, which would be used for very fast M.2 storage. With three total M.2 slots on the board, it&rsquo;s sufficient for most gaming and workstation entry-level builds. Power users may want four or more M.2 slots, as you&rsquo;ll find on higher-priced options. SATA ports are also good here, with six total, generally more than B650 offerings we&rsquo;ve seen. Q-Latch is here on the M.2 slots, allowing for easy install and removal, too.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have PCIe Gen 4 16x for the GPU, which should be sufficient as even the mighty RTX 4090 is only Gen 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lower M.2 slots do not have a heatsink available to them, so you&rsquo;ll have to provide your own. We&rsquo;d like to see the silver design extend further down to include these heatsinks, both aesthetically and functionally.</p>



<p>USB port selection is good, with 10 available ports. You won&rsquo;t get USB4 at this price level, but it does have a Thunderbolt 4 header that you can expand with a supported accessory. You&rsquo;ll also get a PS/2 port&mdash;a legacy feature that&rsquo;s sometimes still used in older or niche use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HDMI and DisplayPort out are available&mdash;which pair nicely with the iGPU of the Ryzen 7000 GPUs when you need a quick, GPU-less diagnostic session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rounding out the I/O, you have three audio connections for the Realtek 7.1. The codec is not as high-end as some of the others available on Strix and ROG motherboards, but it&rsquo;s sufficient for good sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note there is no integrated I/O shield here, a feature we&rsquo;d like to see on <em>all</em> motherboards going forward. (Who hasn&rsquo;t finished off a build, only to realize you forgot to install the I/O shield?)</p>



<h2 id="asus-prime-x670-p-design">Asus Prime X670-P: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Prime X670-P" class="wp-image-1430049" height="697" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-19-at-4.17.04-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus Prime X670-P sports a sleek , all silver and black design.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus Prime X670-P has lots of silver-centric design elements, with black lettering. It&rsquo;s an attractive offering, minimal by nature and monochromatic. This will look great in any build, from gaming PCs to workstations.</p>



<p>Compared to more expensive motherboards, it&rsquo;s certainly no-frills in the rest of the aesthetics. Beneath the top PCIe slot areas, the motherboard is finished off in the dark PCB color. At least the battery is in plain sight, as opposed to being hidden under a hard-to-access shroud! We&rsquo;d love to see the design continued throughout the entire motherboard, however, as it looks a bit unfinished stopping part way down. (Plus no heatsinks for the two lower M.2 slots).</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s no backplate, but the rear does match the character of the front&mdash;though you&rsquo;ll never see it after you&rsquo;ve finished your build. Overall, this is a very functional, minimalist design that&rsquo;s certainly recognizable as being part of the Prime series we&rsquo;ve seen for years from Asus.</p>



<h2 id="asus-prime-x670-p-performance-software-and-bios">Asus Prime X670-P: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>With a VRM of 12+2 DrMos packing 60 amps, plus a six-layer PCB, even the Ryzen 9 7950X will do fine here. For this class motherboard, it may be better paired with the other CPUs in the lineup, such as the Ryzen 7 7700X. It does best at stock and factory settings since it isn&rsquo;t primarily meant for hardcore overclocking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you do want to tinker, the Asus BIOS has always been a pleasure to use, and remains so here. You&rsquo;ll be able to tune the CPU to your liking, including setting Eco Modes and your DDR5 Expo profiles. &ldquo;Intelligent&rdquo; and Ai overclocking options are also present, which allow for simpler performance enhancements without needing approval from NASA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;d recommend more frequent early BIOS updates since the X670 chipset is so new. Problems are constantly getting addressed and fixed even on seemingly stable boards. Thankfully, Asus makes it easy to update the BIOS, and even includes BIOS Flashback if you need to recover from system issues. Some longer boot times may be an issue on initial builds, but it&rsquo;s not unique to this particular motherboard.</p>



<p>Asus Armoury Crate is available as a download for an &ldquo;All In One&rdquo; software package. It will let you adjust Aura Sync RGB profiles for all connected components at the touch of a button. (You can set it to dark mode too, for non-RGB aficionados).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to adjust the fan curves of the six PWM fan headers, and even let Ai tune the fan curves for you. You&rsquo;ll also check for driver updates, and utility downloads directly from Asus. It&rsquo;s certainly the best motherboard software we&rsquo;ve seen from the various manufactures, with a nicer polish than most.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Prime X670-P" class="wp-image-1430062" height="907" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-19-at-4.18.09-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p></p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-asus-prime-x670-p">Should you buy the Asus Prime X670-P?</h2>



<p>The Asus Prime X670-P gives users a balanced motherboard for under $300, while offering the benefits of the new X670 chipset. With Ryzen 7000 CPUs being recently discounted at retailers, it may be the perfect pairing for users with a midrange Ryzen 7000 CPU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gamers will benefit from the competent performance, and it even has RGB headers too! Content creators will be happy with the USB ports and storage offerings on hand. More demanding users will miss faster USB options, and perhaps more PCIe Gen 5 lanes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;d love to see Wi-Fi standard without having a separate Wi-Fi version, and I/O integrated shrouds are welcomed. The exposed lower M.2 NVMe slots would also benefit from a heatsink, both aesthetically and functionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, this is a competent motherboard that provides enough features to satisfy most users, without a steep price premium.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>2022 was a fantastic year for PC gaming, especially since graphics cards are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">finally affordable again (sort of)</a>. But games like <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>God of War</em> aren&rsquo;t exactly available if you aren&rsquo;t rocking some serious GPU wattage. That&rsquo;s okay: the PC game marketplace is wide enough that there are still tons of fantastic new titles that will run on even on the rustiest, dustiest, and crustiest Windows computer. </p>



<p>If you use a low-power laptop or desktop, you can still play a huge assortment of games from Steam, the Epic Games Store, and others. As I&rsquo;ve done for the last five years running, I&rsquo;ve picked out the best and brightest games that will run even on low-power machines. (Oh, and it&rsquo;s a nice bonus that most of these games come in well under the &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; $70 price tag.) </p>



<p>Here are my picks, in no particular order. Not enough? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557177/the-best-pc-games-of-2021-that-dont-need-a-graphics-card.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Check out the 2021 roundup too!</a> </p>



<h2><em>Railbound</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><em>Railbound </em>is a train-themed puzzle game that stars two heckin&rsquo; good puppers. (That&rsquo;s dogs, for those who aren&rsquo;t terminally online.) It&rsquo;s your job to lay tracks, throw switches, and get cars attached to the engine in the right order. You&rsquo;ll have to strategically lay the tracks and switches around environmental obstacles to make everything run on time. </p>



<p>Initially released on mobile, <em>Raolbound&rsquo;s </em>adorable cartoon graphics hide a devilishly clever puzzle system. And with over 150 stages in the PC version of the game, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of head-scratching challenges to get through. And yes, you can pet the dogs (thanks to a recent game patch). </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1967510/Railbound/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Railbound</a> </em>is $13 on Steam. </p>



<h2><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Somewhere between<em> Animal Crossing </em>and Jonestown sits<em> Cult of the Lamb</em>, a combination town manager-dugeon crawler. Build up your cult of cuddly critters and your compound to get better at fighting, then go out and fight to gather resources and defeat rival religions. The juxtaposition of sweetie-pie art style and dark subject matter harkens back to games like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, but the combination of roguelite combat and town management is a unique one even without the creepy spiritualism. </p>



<p>Reviewers say that managing your resurrected lamb&rsquo;s cult takes up the lion&rsquo;s share of the game, so if you don&rsquo;t like interacting with every member of your little insane village every day, this isn&rsquo;t the game for you. Of course, you could just sacrifice them to your dark god to more efficiently murder your cult competition &mdash; hooray for player choices! </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cult of the Lamb</a> </em>is $25 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/game/cult_of_the_lamb&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoG.com</a>. </p>



<h2><em>Return to Monkey Island</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>For over 30 years, the <em>Monkey Island</em> series has been the gold standard in point-and-click adventure games. So when the original designer and writer team said they were making a new one for the first time since <em>Monkey Island 2</em> waaaaaay back in 1991, it was kind of a big deal. Almost as big a deal as the controversial new art style, which is a bit more avante garde than when pixels were almost as big as the floppy disks the games came on. </p>



<p>Fans of the original won&rsquo;t mind, especially if they haven&rsquo;t been impressed with LucasArts&rsquo; attempts to maintain the series beyond the scope of the first two games. Make no mistake, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> is, in every sense, a return to the classic point-and-click pirate comedy. If you&rsquo;re expecting a few decades of game design to have changed things, think again. That makes the game a treat for purists, and possibly a bit of a chore if you&rsquo;re more used to Telltale-style adventure games. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a></em> is $25 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/game/return_to_monkey_island&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoG.com</a>. </p>



<h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Imagine the simple graphics and monster-slaying gameplay of an early <em>Castlevania</em>, combined with the huge battlefields and thousand-unit armies of <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>. That&rsquo;s Vampire Survivors, an addictive little bullet hell shooter that lets you slay an absolutely ludicrous number of pestilent pixelated poltergeists. The game is so small it actually started online at Itch.io, where <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can still play the free version</a>. </p>



<p>Gameplay is astonishingly simple &mdash; you don&rsquo;t even fire, your little monster slayer will do that all on their own. But the roguelike setup and incremental upgrades after your inevitable death give the game that <em>just one more run before bed</em> feeling. Finding the right combos of weapons and powerups is the key to surviving long enough to make progress. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></em> is $5 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/vampire-survivors-game-preview/9pd5bm2z8c4l&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass</a>. </p>



<h2><em>The Wandering Village</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Throughout human history there have been many tribes and peoples who believed the world rested on the back of some giant turtle or snake. The teeny-tiny people of <em>The Wandering Village</em> don&rsquo;t have to believe it: they know they live on a giant dinosaur thing&rsquo;s back, and they like it that way. Another twist on the standard city builder-manager, this game tasks you to deal with your village literally walking around in different environments and weather. </p>



<p>But the village isn&rsquo;t the only thing you need to manage. The leviathan you&rsquo;re riding on is just as important as the people and the buildings, and you&rsquo;ll have to keep it happy and healthy to make sure everyone in this symbiotic relationship thrives. A surreal blend of 2D and 3D art combined with chill tunes makes <em>The Wandering Village</em> a perfect game for winding down.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Wandering Village</a> </em>is $25 on Steam. </p>



<h2><em>Cursed to Golf</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>For a football fan like me, watching an eternity of Golf Network is a punishment far more terrifying than anything Sisyphus or Tantalus had to endure. The protagonist of <em>Cursed to Golf</em> might agree, at least after he&rsquo;s had to go through eighteen hellish holes to escape a golf-themed purgatory. The game is a series of physics puzzles, wherein you must put your way to freedom. </p>



<p>But this is &ldquo;golf&rdquo; in the Mario sense, even though it&rsquo;s in pixelated (and charming) 2D. You can use all sorts of wacky power-ups to get past the underworld&rsquo;s most fiendish traps and tricky bosses. Once you&rsquo;re done with the main game you can use your Ace Cards in more than 80 special stages and climb your way up the leaderboards. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726120/Cursed_to_Golf/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cursed to Golf</a></em> is $20 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/game/cursed_to_golf&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoG.com</a> and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cursed-to-golf-a6bc22&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. </p>



<h2><em>Signalis</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Fans of the original, fixed-camera survival horror classics like <em>Alone in the Dark </em>and <em>Resident Evil </em>owe it to themselves to check out <em>Signalis</em>. The game&rsquo;s sci-fi setting and low-poly anime graphics offer such a distinct style that it&rsquo;s a joy to watch in motion, even if what you&rsquo;re watching is meant to terrify. </p>



<p>You play as an android, stranded on a crashed ship and a lifeless world, hunting for her partner and her memories. But as you can probably guess, not everything is as it seems. Solve puzzles, preserve ammo and resources, and try to stay alive (if you ever were to begin with) as you solve a dystopian mystery that reaches beyond the solar system. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Signalis</a> </em>is $20 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/signalis/9plf2rs7jrzl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass</a>. </p>



<h2><em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Growing up is hard enough without having to deal with the headaches of oxygen management and the occasional bug-eyed alien. But such is the case in <em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist, </em>a game that combines classic JRPG elements with modern combat and absolutely stunning 2D art. In addition to keeping yourself and your fellow colonists alive, you&rsquo;re looking for love in all the extrasolar places. </p>



<p>The game is a mix of role-playing and visual novel &mdash; you might be tempted to call it a dating sim, but there&rsquo;s a lot more going on under the surface than just flirting. (Incidentally, this one is very much not for kids). You&rsquo;ve got ten years to save the colony and set yourself up for adulthood via card-based combat and conflict resolution. If you can&rsquo;t, start again and aim for another of the story&rsquo;s 29 different endings. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</a></em> is $25 on Steam.</p>



<h2><em>Pentiment</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>A pentiment is a hidden image underneath the top layer of a painting. It&rsquo;s appropriate, since Obsidian, the AAA developer behind <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, <em>Grounded, </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds, </em>is hiding among all these indie developers. But this murder mystery set in a 16th-century German village, and illustrated like one of the manuscripts you might find in an ancient monastery, is about as far away as you can get from the mainstream. </p>



<p>While <em>Pentiment </em>is essentially a point-and-click adventure game, it boasts a story that spans 25 years, with decisions and consequences just as elongated. If <em>Monkey Island</em> is too much of a throwback for your adventure gaming tastes, this is sure to deliver something a little more fresh. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1205520/Pentiment/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pentiment</a> </em>is $20 on Steam. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/pentiment#purchaseoptions&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass</a>. </p>



<h2><em>Triangle Strategy</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The classic tactical RPG is seeing something of a renaissance this year, with games like<em> Marvel&rsquo;s Midnight Suns</em> and <em>Tactics Ogre Reborn.</em> But if you want something both old-fashioned and original, give <em>Triangle Strategy</em> a try. Coming from the same Square Enix team as well-received retro RPGs like <em>Octopath Traveler, </em>it&rsquo;s a love letter to grid-based medieval party combat. </p>



<p>The three-way struggle of the world&rsquo;s main countries is mirrored in the morality system, which tugs equally at the player&rsquo;s utility, morality, and liberty. A battle setup heavily leaning on terrain advantage and special abilities should scratch your strategy itch. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Triangle Strategy</a> </em>is $60 on Steam. </p>



<h2><em>Honorable Mention: Dwarf Fortress</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Technically, the first version of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">came out 16 years ago</a>. A small but thriving community has been obsessed with this world-building game ever since, even though its text-based graphics look more like some kind of ASCII nightmare than a modern video game. Understanding its incredibly deep and evolving systems is a study in itself, and one that most gamers simply can&rsquo;t be bothered with. </p>



<p>But you really should try, if only to say you did. And with a new pixel-based graphics makeover, <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> now looks like it&rsquo;s only 35 years old, instead of something out of the dawn of computing. To start a game of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> is to create a tiny, living, breathing world, and to survive in it is an accomplishment that few can claim&hellip;and none can keep.  </p>



<p>The new, pixel art version of <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> is $30 on Steam. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/&amp;xcust=2-1-1435987-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The original is free</a>. </p>
