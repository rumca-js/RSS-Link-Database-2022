Here are our five best PC games of 2022 and five honorable mentions that you should check out ASAP.

The PC gaming ecosystem is easily the largest in the industry, with tens of thousands of games available to play. Not only that, unlike Switch or PlayStation, there isn't exactly a "first-party" publisher on PC, which means there are few true marquee exclusive games on the platform. Therefore, this list of the year's five best PC games naturally features games you'll sometimes (though not always) find elsewhere, but in cases where multiplatform games appear, we believe they're best played on PC and deserve a spot on this list. This year's list is an eclectic bunch, too, with a speedrunning gem, a deep detective-like experience, and a physics playground all earning top spots.

## Best Nintendo Switch Games of 2022

The Nintendo Switch is getting up in years, but the hybrid portable console is still going strong. The platform had a solid year of great new releases, especially from outside the realm of Nintendo's usual top-tier franchises.
Games like Kirby and Switch Sports were excellent callbacks to some beloved brands that didn't lean hard on bigger names like Mario or Zelda. Xenoblade Chronicles marked another enormous RPG for the platform that has become known as a destination for playing epics on the go. 

In the realm of Nintendo's biggest franchises, this was a year of unusual entries. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope returned to the bizarre tactical game partnership between Nintendo and Ubisoft, to exceptional results. And Pokemon Legends: Arceus was a big departure from the usual Pokemon formula, helping to chart a new path forward that we saw partly iterated on in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which released later in the year. 

Nintendo was not immune to delays, however, which pushed some games outside of the 2022 release window. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--previously informally known as Breath of the Wild 2--was pushed to May 2023. And in an unpredictable turn of events, Nintendo made the last-minute decision to indefinitely delay the release of Advance Wars Reboot Camp in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Either or both of those games remain among our most anticipated, and could very well have landed on this list. 

Despite those hurdles, this was an incredibly strong year for the Nintendo Switch, with a wide array of games that will keep you playing docked and handheld well into the new year.

## High On Life Review

Squanch Games' trademark humor mixes with solid shooting and traversal in this goofy space romp.
#GameSpot #HighOnLife

High On Life tells the story of an unnamed protagonist--whom everyone calls "Bounty Hunter," even their own sister--fighting against an alien drug cartel that's invaded Earth. The cartel wishes to round up every human on the planet and sell them as the drug, which other aliens can consume via elaborate machines. Our bounty hunter hero is armed with Gatlians, a race of talking guns, and each Gatlian possesses its own attacks and abilities. The concept is admittedly very weird, but it's a well-told story that kept me guessing until the end.

At this point, it bears acknowledging that this is 100% a Justin Roiland project, complete with all the hallmarks of his comedic philosophy. Rapid-fire monologues, fart jokes, demolition of the fourth wall, ad-libs, dark comedy--it's all intertwined within the game's narrative and presentation. If things like Rick and Morty, Trover Saves The Universe, or Solar Opposites aren't your cup of tea, this won't be either. That said, I have a very high tolerance for this sort of goofiness and I found myself laughing throughout the 10-hour adventure.
