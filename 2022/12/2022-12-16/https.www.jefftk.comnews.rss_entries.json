[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Introducing Shrubgrazer", "description": "<p><span>\n\nSince starting using Mastodon a month ago, a few different things\nhaven't been a good fit for how I like to use social media:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>I'm relatively free with following people, but there are some\npeople whose posts I don't want to miss.  I'd like these to go <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/user-controlled-algorithmic-feeds\">at the top of my feed</a>.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Fediverse replies logically form a tree, but Mastodon just\nshows you a list. This isn't good for reading complex branching\ndiscussions.  When I set up replies on my blog <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/mastodon-replies-as-comments\">as comments</a> I made them be\na tree, and I like this a lot better.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI decided to write a custom client that does both of these the way I'd\nprefer, and also fixes some other problems I've had with social media\nhistorically:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>On Facebook, it's reasonably common that you saw something but\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/cleaning-a-spoon-is-complex\">can't find it again</a>. In\nmy client there's a history page that shows you everything you've\nlooked at in reverse chronological order.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Traditional algorithmic feeds have weights but you can't\ninteract with them directly. Instead you just notice that it's showing\nyou a lot of posts by someone you happened to have a few interactions\nwith, while never showing you posts by many other people.  The weights\nfor this feed are directly exposed in the UI, and there is a page\nwhere you can make any changes you want.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Your behavior only changes weights when you make a conscious\nchoice to change them.  There are various things that I will interact\nwith (TikTok style shorts, angry discussions) that, on reflection,\naren't how I would like to spend my time.  When interacting with an\nopaque algorithm there's no way to say \"I know I just spent a while\nlooking at that distracting flashy thing, but it isn't actually what I\nwant you to show me more of\".\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIf you were to visit you'd be asked to log in:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-welcome-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-welcome.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt won't actually let you log in because the list of allowed users is\ncurrently just me, but let's imagine you're me.  On logging in you'd\nsee a feed, which is a series of posts sorted first by the weight I've\nassigned to the author and then in reverse chronological order.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-mobile-feed-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-mobile-feed.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you click on a post you get a forum-style threaded view:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-mobile-discussion-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"1148\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-mobile-discussion.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt also works on desktop, where you have a bit more space:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-showing-children-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-showing-children.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you open a post that has both children and parents it shows the\nparents above and then threads the children below.  This means even\nwhen exploring a large discussion you can still see your context.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-showing-post-with-children-and-parents-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"999\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-showing-post-with-children-and-parents.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nYou can favorite posts by clicking the star.  You can also reply to\nthem inline by clicking the \"up and then left\" reply icon:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-example-reply-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-example-reply.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe hamburger menu in the upper left gives additional options:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-hambuger-menu-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/screenshot-shrubgrazer-hambuger-menu.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe client has only just gotten to where it's usable, and there are\nstill several key features where you need to fall back to the standard\nUI (notifications, following, boosting).  Still, if it's something\nyou'd like to play with, the client is open source (<a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer\">github</a>) and is a\npython wsgi app with no dependencies. I could also temporarily add you\nas a guest on my instance if you wanted to try it without running\ncode.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are a lot of other things I'd like to do with this, like <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer/issues/2\">integrating\nnotifications into the feed</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer/issues/6\">threading\nrelated posts in the feed</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer/issues/8\">showing\ncontext on recent entries</a>.  You can see the <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement\">full\nlist</a> on GitHub, and feel free to suggest more either in a comment\nor as a <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/shrubgrazer/issues/new\">new\nissue</a>.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0bTcUkhT89Gh3bpwqX2n1QE76TaSSAXXSsvJzMMtpSJgt63nnp7m4iqkNagZpxFVDl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/Doj5zwgdTouuTGNiA\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109523900751872891\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/introducing-shrubgrazer", "date_published": "2022-12-16 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
