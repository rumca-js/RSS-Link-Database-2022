<p>Google, Apple and Mozilla are collaborating on a better web browser benchmark. Speedometer 3 will be a “cross-industry collaborative effort” from the Chrome, Safari and Firefox makers to create a new model that balances the companies’ visions for measuring responsiveness.</p><p>Three companies making a tool that will rate the effectiveness of their competing products sounds like a recipe for disaster. However, Speedometer’s <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/blob/main/Governance.md">governance policy</a> includes a consent system that differs based on potential ramifications. For example, significant changes will require approval from the other two companies, while “non-trivial changes” will need consent from one of the other two parties. Meanwhile, “trivial changes” can be green-lit by a reviewer from any of the three browser makers. The policy’s aim is that “the working team should be able to move quickly for most changes, with a higher level of process and consensus expected based on the impact of the change.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="38b3fe8f8c8a43f5a788c224614f09e2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Unlike some past benchmarks, Speedometer 3 is being started as a cross-industry collaborative effort. <br />Building this will be hard work, and working together gives us a chance to build the best version to help make the Web faster for years to come. <a href="https://t.co/lZyegpIAeW">https://t.co/lZyegpIAeW</a></p>— Mozilla Developer 👩🏾‍💻 (@mozhacks) <a href="https://twitter.com/mozhacks/status/1603435353616023552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The project will follow <a href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/">Speedometer 2</a>, the current de facto benchmark developed by Apple’s WebKit team.

## Six things we learned from Formula E’s preseason test

<p>The first in-depth testing for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen-e-electric-race-car-164542680.html">Formula E’s Gen3 car</a> took place this week in Valencia, just one month away from the start of Season 9 in Mexico City. Across three full days, one simulated race and an added one-hour jaunt on a planned media day, some teams ran nearly 600 laps and over 2,000 kilometers to get a handle on what the new cars are capable of. The week wasn’t without incidents, of course, but Formula E co-founder and chief championship officer Alberto Longo said the sessions were “very successful.”</p><p>“The teams and drivers are obviously still learning and integrating the new system,” Longo explained. “We know that [going] from Gen2 to Gen3 is much harder to navigate than from Gen 1 to Gen 2, so it’s great to see that we are already much quicker than where we were with Gen2.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After this week’s testing in Spain, here are the biggest things we learned about Formula E’s pending Gen3 debut next month.</p><h2>The Gen3 cars look great on track</h2><div id="df96845b025e4d40919a69ffa7d9dca5"></div><p>I’ll be the first to admit that when Formula E pulled the wraps off the Gen3 car in Monaco last April, I was a bit skeptical of the new, bold look. Once the teams started revealing their final liveries in the lead up to the Valencia test, I started to see the potential. All of the teams have been posting clips this week and Formula E has compiled footage as well, showing that the new cars do indeed look great on track despite their fighter jet-esque design.</p><h2>The Gen3 car isn’t that much faster than Gen2 yet</h2><p>When the Gen3 car was first revealed one of the main points Formula E hyped up was how much faster the new trim would be. That included a top speed of up to 200MPH. Of course, speed is dependent on a number of factors, including the circuit, but on paper the new cars should be much quicker than the Gen2 EVs. In the first practice session of the week, Maserati MSG Racing's Maximilian Günther posted the <a href="https://fiaformulae.com/en/news/11819/maseratis-guenther-tops-first-test-session-of-gen3-era-in-valencia">quickest official time</a> of 1:26.096, slower than the fastest lap of Valencia testing last year in the Gen2 car of 1:25.763. The quickest lap this week came <a href="https://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/11980/guenther-ends-pre-season-test-on-top">when Günther notched</a> a 1:25.127 on the final day.</p><p>“When developing a new car, it’s really important to collect as much data as possible and to get a good feel for the car, and I believe that we have achieved this over the past few days,” Günther said. “Now, we just need to refine some aspects of our performance and continue with our preparations ahead of the first race of the season in Mexico.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="Maserati MSG Racing" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/62441fe0-7d79-11ed-adee-5f3c380c2c62" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"> Maserati MSG Racing</div></figure><p>With the Gen3 cars being lighter and more powerful, an added 100kW to be exact, you’d expect the lap times to fall from the previous generation running. However, with limited testing, specifically in regards to the new tires, teams haven’t dialed-in their setups to take full advantage of the new cars just yet. Hankook <a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/why-theres-no-sign-of-formula-es-expected-gen3-pace-boost-yet/">told <em>The Race</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that some drivers experienced the new compound “for the first time in their life” during the initial session in Valencia.</p><h2>The new tires are posing a challenge</h2><p>For the first eight seasons, Formula E ran Michelin tires. Starting with Season 9, however, the series is making the switch to Hankook. More specifically, it moved to a more sustainable compound that aligns with Formula E’s green initiatives. 30 percent of the new tires are made from environmentally-friendlier materials like natural rubber. The challenge for Hankook is not only does the tire have to be better for the Earth, it also has to work well in both wet and dry conditions since Formula E only runs one compound.</p><p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/formula-e/news/the-tricks-formula-e-teams-must-understand-with-hankooks-new-tyres/10411393/"><em>Autosport </em>reports</a> that Hankook tested “maybe even 80 different specs” of tire compounds during the development phase, according to the company’s head of motorsport Manfred Sandbichler. The end result is a tire where the inside is softer and the outside is harder – a combination that could have implications for how teams tackle corners at each circuit.</p><p>One thing that’s clear throughout the paddock is that the new Hankook tires are more durable than the final spec of Michelins. McLaren Racing’s Jake Hughes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mclaren-formula-e-gen3-interview-150058523.html">told Engadget recently</a> that the new tires “behave very differently” and that they’re “a bit harder, a bit stiffer.” The harder tire should be more durable than what Formula E ran in the past, according to Hughes, as the degradation on the Michlins would lead to the treaded tire being nearly slick by the end of the race.</p><p>“We need to try to understand how we can maximize it,” he explained. “At some point we’re talking in miniscule details to try to find an advantage over the competition.”</p><h2>Teams are dealing with reliability concerns</h2><figure><img alt="Formula E" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/576e9df0-7d7b-11ed-af6f-3aa74e4387d6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Formula E</div></figure><p>With limited testing ahead of the official preseason sessions in Valencia, teams are finding issues with their cars. <a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/formula-e-adds-more-test-running-as-teams-battle-issues/"><em>The Race </em>reports</a> that some teams were in such a crunch to make it to Spain that they didn’t have time to shakedown their cars beforehand to make sure the basic systems were functioning properly due to parts that arrived late. According to that report, around-the-clock work shifts were required for some to make it to testing.</p><p>During a mock race this week, eight of 22 cars retired before the end of the trial event. One car didn’t make the start due to battery issues and two others had to pit on the first lap. A handful of others had to visit pitlane, which doesn’t happen during a Formula E race unless you have an issue (until the series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-will-trial-a-30-second-quick-charging-stop-in-some-races-next-season-170257427.html">institutes charging stops</a> at least). The two biggest problems seem to be with the Williams Advanced Engineering battery setups and the brakes, both of which <a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/why-gen3-formula-e-era-is-in-trouble-before-its-even-begun/"><em>The Race </em>reported</a> teams were having issues with in early November. Formula E is said to be working on a secondary braking system after a number crashes in testing prior to Valencia, but <a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/testings-alleviated-some-gen3-reliability-fears-but-not-all/"><em>The Race </em>understands</a> that it won’t be available during the first two E-Prix in Mexico City and Diriyah.</p><h2>Teams expect Gen3 cars to improve quickly and drastically</h2><figure><img alt="Maserati MSG Racing" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/13357a20-7d79-11ed-9fff-bceb25fe3a1b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Maserati MSG Racing</div></figure><p>This isn’t exactly a new development, but teams up and down the paddock echoed the sentiment after the handful of test runs. McLaren’s team principal Ian James <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mclaren-formula-e-gen3-interview-150058523.html">told Engadget</a> that he expects “a development rather than a complete evolution.”</p><p>“As much as we’ll prepare the best we can for Mexico and that first race, undoubtedly there’s going to be a very steep learning curve as we get into the new season,” he explained. “And a fast rate of development as well.”</p><p>Drivers are also clear there’s “a lot to learn and plenty of work to do” before the first race, as Maserati’s Edoardo Mortara explained. “This week of testing has been intense but overall positive, and although we’re still understanding the finer points of the Gen3, I think we are in a strong position,” he said. “From here, we will fully analyze our data, debrief and continue to gather simulations from HQ.”</p><h2>The first race in Mexico City could be… interesting</h2><p>The issues with batteries and brakes aside, there are a number of elements of a proper Formula E E-Prix that could make the first full race quite an adventure. The new tires pose a challenge on a full street circuit, as opposed to the smooth track in Valencia. Getting the rubber in the proper window for qualifying and managing any degradation over the course of the race will be key.</p><p>There are also some unknowns with race format as well, as Formula E <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-will-trial-a-30-second-quick-charging-stop-in-some-races-next-season-170257427.html">plans to test</a> a mandatory Attack Charge stop in certain races in Season 9. Attack Charge will give drivers a temporary power boost much like Attack Mode has in previous seasons. <a href="https://fiaformulae.com/en/news/11100/sporting-regulations-announced-for-season-9">Formula E says</a> the 30-second stop can deliver 4kWh of energy to power an “enhanced” Attack Mode where the power of the Gen3 cars increases from 300kW to 350kW. It’s unclear where the Attack Charge trials will take place as specific races weren’t announced when the updated sporting regulations were revealed last month.</p>

## NHTSA opens probe into GM's autonomous driving technology

<p>The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the self-driving technology behind General Motors' robotaxi fleet. This announcement <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-opens-safety-probe-into-autonomous-driving-system-gms-cruise-vehicles-2022-12-16">follows three reported accidents allegedly caused by Cruise vehicles</a> braking hard or otherwise becoming immobilized in traffic, creating unannounced obstacles for other vehicles and resulting in rear-end collisions with other motorists.</p><p>&quot;With respect to the incidents of hard braking, NHTSA has received three reports of the ADS initiating a hard braking maneuver in response to another road user that was quickly approaching from the rear,&quot; <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INOA-PE22014-4871.PDF">the agency reports</a>, noting that human supervisors were aboard for each incident. &quot;In each case, the other road user subsequently struck the rear of the ADS-equipped vehicle.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;With respect to the incidents of vehicle immobilization, NHTSA has been notified of multiple reports involving Cruise ADS equipped vehicles, operating without onboard human supervision, becoming immobilized,&quot; the report continues. &quot;When this occurs, the vehicle may strand vehicle passengers in unsafe locations, such as lanes of travel or intersections, and become an unexpected obstacle to other road users.&quot;</p><p>In response the company touted its technology's history of safe operations. “Cruise’s safety record is publicly reported and includes having driven nearly 700,000 fully autonomous miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities,&quot; Hannah Lindow, Cruise spokesperson, told Engadget via email. &quot;This is against the backdrop of over 40,000 deaths each year on American roads. There’s always a balance between healthy regulatory scrutiny and the innovation we desperately need to save lives, which is why we’ll continue to fully cooperate with NHTSA or any regulator in achieving that shared goal.”</p><p>The company goes on to argue that in the cases of hard braking, the vehicles were reacting to the actions of other drivers, had a human operator onboard (though the ADS was in control at the time), and has already met with the NHTSA regarding each incident. Cruise frames the immobilization events as equivalent to a flat tire, wherein the ADS encounters an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation, turns on the vehicle's hazards and pulls off to the side of the road.</p><p>Cruise LLC is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2013 by Kyle Vogt and Dan Kan. GM acquired the autonomous driving technology company three years later. Since then, General Motors has lavished its subsidiary with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-06-gm-cruise-to-receive-2-25-billion-softbank-investment.html">funding</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html">facilities</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-gm-doubling-staff-at-cruise-autonomous-vehicles.html">staffing</a>, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-making-its-own-chips-self-driving-vehicles-051402952.html">develop its own processor chips</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-gm-cruise-origin-self-driving-shuttle.html">the Origin autonomous shuttle bus</a>. The company began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html">testing ADS rides in San Francisco</a> in June, 2021 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-charge-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-092000547.html">earlier this year earned regulatory approval to charge for driverless taxi services</a> within the city.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has also suffered setbacks in its pursuit of self-driving taxis. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-ceo-to-step-down-as-gm-accelerates-self-driving-car-plans-221238170.html">Division CEO Dan Ammann stepped down from his position in June</a>, replaced for the interim by CTO and founder Kyle Vogt. Cruise made headlines in April <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-vehicle-drives-away-from-police-194657296.html">when a police officer tried and failed to pull one over during a traffic stop</a> and again in June when seemingly all of them decided that the corner of Gough and Fulton <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-driverless-taxis-blocked-san-francisco-traffic-for-hours-robotaxi-gm-204000451.html">would make for a perfect impromptu parking lot</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the NHTSA is sure it's aware of every braking/immobilization incident to date, the agency is opening a preliminary evaluation,&quot;to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and fully assess the potential safety-related issues posed by these two types of incidents.&quot; It has not announced a timeline for publication of the PE's findings.</p>

## Ford F-150 Lightning prices are going up again

<p>Ford F-150 Lightning prices are going up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-price-increase-154556193.html">again</a>. The US automaker is raising the electric pickup’s starting cost by $4,000, bringing the new entry price to $55,974. That’s a 40 percent increase over the electric vehicle’s initial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-pre-order-reservation-jim-farley-162653871.html">starting price</a> in May 2021.</p><p>Ford <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/16/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-gets-another-price-hike.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1671203967">told</a><em>CNBC</em> today that it is changing pricing “as a normal course of business due to rising material costs, market factors, and ongoing supply chain constraints.” Raw material costs of nickel, cobalt and lithium — crucial to electric car batteries — have soared alongside EV demand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Through the end of November, Ford has only sold 13,258 F-150 Lightning units, but that number is a reflection of supply constraints rather than low demand (on the contrary, the truck is still a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-resale-ban-191019604.html">hot commodity</a>). The company plans to boost production to 150,000 units by next fall — and it said earlier this week that it’s still on track to meet that goal. It recently added a third shift of workers to a Michigan production plant to help meet that goal.</p><p>Ford is the second-biggest American seller of electric vehicles (behind Tesla), and the F-150 Lightning is the top-selling electric truck. Considering Ford F-series trucks have been the best-selling vehicles in the US for three decades, that customer loyalty appears to be carrying over to EVs. Earlier this year, Engadget's Roberto Baldwin rode along for a test drive and commented on how much it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-preview-video-170103332.html">felt like a standard F-150</a>.</p>

We think Apple's latest ultra-thin portable is the definition of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">well-rounded laptop</a>. It's fast for day-to-day productivity or even more intensive work on like media editing. The screen feels more expansive than its 13.6-inch size might suggest and the speakers are surprisingly strong. There's no SD card slot or a 120Hz screen, and the Air probably isn't what you want for intensive gaming or heavy video and audio editing, but it's a well rounded daily drive. For more intense use, you'll likely want to go for the 2021 MacBook Pro models.

There's no wireless charging though, a drawback you may be able to overlook when the buds are $40 cheaper than usual.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKTDQxTjlDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDYxNTBhMS1jYTI5LTQ5MzAtOWJjYS0yZjE1OWIyNWYwZTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV0ETJqbieURyIiaEj1WpLNXkguPdWcH58hrzKWNvsmn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JL41N9C" id="a010df5ff89c4855a12bbc2027100b3a">Buy Beat Fit Pro at Amazon - $160</a><h2>Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5vc9nTX1BYPudgTRzZrEYQ--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTU4NDt3PTg3NTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-09/e86734a0-3e35-11ed-9779-d957baec7c8e.cf.webp" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you want your personal audio delivered in an over-the-ear package, you may be pleased to hear that <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOThGS1hUOEwvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZ0aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTJmMDdmYS1iNWUxLTQzZDktODViZC1jYWE1NzNlMTgxMmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARw1kdqVkkMp0wcBHVwGmJi7Dgnd2DOXftOZzIXX_bLh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB098FKXT8L%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1&amp;uuid=2qFUqIWM2UvqBFaF0077">Bose's QuietComfort 45</a> is on sale for $229 at <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOThGS1hUOEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDYxNTBhMS1jYTI5LTQ5MzAtOWJjYS0yZjE1OWIyNWYwZTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe1veANG1tDmYh0dBfBqU_NJDbyjN-xsDhoT3XSQw5v_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB098FKXT8L%2F">Amazon</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTY2MTI2Mi1SRUcvYm9zZV84NjY3MjRfMDIwMF9xdWlldGNvbWZvcnRfNDVfbm9pc2VfY2FuY2VsaW5nX3dpcmVsZXNzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0NjE1MGExLWNhMjktNDkzMC05YmNhLTJmMTU5YjI1ZjBlMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVTBhCh0jFDHj8-P6yFcfKPyuOj4L2z0IHN9D-2zTucI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1661262-REG%2Fbose_866724_0200_quietcomfort_45_noise_canceling_wireless.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da41807c-aae5-49ff-b905-2c3f70122c64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bose&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYTQxODA3Yy1hYWU1LTQ5ZmYtYjkwNS0yYzNmNzAxMjJjNjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zZS5jb20vZW5fdXMvcHJvZHVjdHMvaGVhZHBob25lcy9ub2lzZV9jYW5jZWxsaW5nX2hlYWRwaG9uZXMvcXVpZXRjb21mb3J0LWhlYWRwaG9uZXMtNDUuaHRtbCN2PXFjNDVfYmxhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0NjE1MGExLWNhMjktNDkzMC05YmNhLTJmMTU5YjI1ZjBlMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ4AA0YYeIVyPnHOpk9lAKbmAnIEjtKmYQnRautqfcGN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fnoise_cancelling_headphones%2Fquietcomfort-headphones-45.html%23v%3Dqc45_black">Bose</a>.

Right now you can get it for 42 percent off at GoPro's website when you bundle it with a GoPro subscription. The camera is usually $400, but when you add a year of the GoPro subscription for $50, GoPro will knock $150 off the price. Then, after you add the camera to your cart, you'll get an additional 15 percent discount as part of GoPro's holiday sale. If that sounds like a lot of numbers, the bottom line is you can get the Mini for just $262.50, and it includes a year of a GoPro subscription. That's a good discount considering the Hero 11 Mini by itself is $400 right now at Amazon.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-11-black-mini-review-150017648.html">hands-on test</a> of the Mini we noted a few drawbacks like a status-only display instead of a touchscreen and no photo mode. That means you'll need to control the camera with the companion app and pull stills your video. But as a helmet- or body-mounted camera, we think this device excels. It has horizon lock and Hyperview mode like the larger Hero 11, plus it offers a second pair of mounting fingers to get the camera oriented exactly the direction you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06fa1f29-e83c-49e4-81a8-9732450da8a9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=GoPro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmZhMWYyOS1lODNjLTQ5ZTQtODFhOC05NzMyNDUwZGE4YTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb3Byby5jb20vZW4vdXMvc2hvcC9jYW1lcmFzL2hlcm8xMS1ibGFjay1taW5pL0NIREhGLTExMS1tYXN0ZXIuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzQ2MTUwYTEtY2EyOS00OTMwLTliY2EtMmYxNTliMjVmMGUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAakP3GSeG_GFRuE6cSnKdi6pNOSOFyDzzqviQ7QmfyCr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fcameras%2Fhero11-black-mini%2FCHDHF-111-master.html" id="50c330fb54564fa6a7b5a687dd0538da">Buy Hero 11 Black Mini at GoPro - $262.50</a><h2>Apple MacBook Pro M2&nbsp;</h2><figure><img alt="The MacBook Pro 13-inch M2 (2022) sits open on a wooden dining room tabletop in a room with blue walls and white doors.

## Waymo now offers driverless rides between Downtown Phoenix and Sky Harbor Airport

<p>Starting today, human-averse travelers in Phoenix can <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2022/12/wheels-up-for-waymo-as-we-expand.html">book</a> a fully autonomous Waymo ride between the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and downtown. The Alphabet-owned company, which is also doubling its fully automated coverage area in the city, says the new route is the world’s only fully autonomous airport robotaxi service.</p><p>Waymo has accelerated its public rollout lately. In March, it received permission to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-commercial-robotaxi-service-california-san-francisco-182026953.html">charge for rides</a> with a human safety driver in San Francisco. It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-094718022.html">got approval</a> last month to offer fully driverless cars there before rolling out service to the public earlier in December. San Francisco riders can now book a Waymo robotaxi across “a large portion of the city, including every neighborhood along the 17-mile Crosstown Trail.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the company is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-driverless-taxi-permit-california-dmv-150046627.html">waiting for approval</a> to charge for rider-only cars in San Francisco. It currently only offers service to Waymo employees, their guests and select members of the public. Waymo was the second fully autonomous service operating in San Francisco, behind GM-owned rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-fared-driverless-rides-san-francisco-113546777.html">Cruise</a> (although it only offers fully automated rides at night).</p><p>Waymo’s expansion means more Americans can book a driverless car, but it’s still modest compared to what you’ll see in China. Baidu's robotaxi service is available to the public in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-shenzhen-141727050.html">larger Chinese cities</a>, although with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/baids-robotaxi-safety-driver-china-autonomous-self-driving-020024214.html">limitations on cars without a safety driver</a>.</p>

## Extreme weather leads to more negative tweets, study finds

<p>If it's ever seemed like people are more crotchety on social media when there's a heatwave or heavy rain, you're probably not alone in having that perspective. Researchers analyzed more than 7.7 billion geotagged <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter/"><ins>tweets</ins></a> from 190 countries that were posted between 2015 and 2021. They used a <a href="https://www.liwc.app/demo/"><ins>language analysis tool</ins></a> to measure the sentiment of tweets against daily weather data.</p><p>The researchers <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1066021">found that</a>, compared with days of regular weather, &quot;both local extreme heat and extreme precipitation events worsen online emotional states globally by elevating rates of posts with negative expressions and also reducing the rate of posts with positive words.&quot; They also determined that people were more likely to tweet negatively during downpours and heatwaves than when daylight savings time kicks in and they forego an hour of sleep.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These outcomes might not seem incredibly surprising. However, the researchers suggested that because the findings were so consistent across tweets from more than 43,000 counties, they indicate that we're finding it hard to adapt to climate change. They carried out the study in the first place to explore the links between climate change and mental health.</p><p>“As of right now, we see very little evidence of adaptation in the way that these new extreme events that are emerging globally are impacting human sentiment,” says Kelton Minor, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University and co-author of the study, told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23511373/extreme-weather-social-media-twitter-sentiment"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. &quot;Since climate change is shifting the extreme tails of most regional temperature and heavy precipitation distributions rightwards, the impact of more severe extremes on overt emotional states may far exceed those registered in the recent past, pending further adaptation,&quot; the abstract of the study reads.</p><p>Minor and co-author Nick Obradovich, chief scientist at a nonprofit called Project Regeneration, found the biggest shift in sentiment during a record-breaking heatwave in the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada in 2021. More than a thousand deaths were linked to that heatwave, while negative sentiment in tweets increased tenfold compared with the typical heatwave in the US, the researchers found. Minor and his colleagues plan to keep monitoring social media sentiment in the face of more extreme weather events, which studies suggest are likely to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-19-research-deadly-heatwaves-often.html/"><ins>happen more often</ins></a> amid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html/"><ins>rising global temperatures</ins></a>.</p>

## HTC plans to reveal its Meta Quest competitor next month

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/htc/">HTC</a> has big plans for CES, which include revealing an all-in-one headset with virtual reality and augmented reality support. The company will formally show off the seemingly small and light headset for the first time on January 5th, but it provided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23510908/htc-vive-ar-vr-headset-preview-ces-flow-focus"><em>The Verge</em></a> with a render that shows a goggles-style design. The device, for which HTC has yet to announce a name, appears to have front- and side-facing cameras.</p><p>Those cameras will be a key part of HTC's plan to deliver a full-color passthrough video feed. As with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html/"><ins>Meta Quest Pro</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pico-4-vr-headset-bytedance-150028514.html/"><ins>Pico 4</ins></a>, you'll be able to see a colorized version of the physical world around you without having to remove the headset. This should also enable HTC to offer more immersive mixed-reality experiences than you'd get with black-and-white passthrough video. What's more, the headset may offer a more dynamic range than rival models, which could enable wearers to more easily read text on computer or phone screens (at least without taking the headset off).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HTC says you'll get two hours of use on a single charge, while the controllers will feature six degrees of freedom and hand tracking. The headset can operate as a standalone device or you can hook it up to a PC for more demanding VR games. You can also use it for exercise, entertainment and productivity, if you're so inclined.</p><p>It's not yet clear whether there'll be built-in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-face-eye-tracking-accessories-154733543.html/">eye tracking</a>, but there is a depth sensor that may enable more in-depth mapping of a user's surroundings. HTC also indicated to <em>The Verge </em>that the headset will protect user privacy by storing data on an encrypted local partition. Pricing and availability are as yet unclear. We'll find out more about the headset — including the name and how it might measure up against the likes of Meta Quest — in a few short weeks.</p>

## What we bought: The Retroid Pocket 3 is my own personal retro-game museum

<p>I’ve become increasingly infatuated with old video games. Lord knows I still play lots of new stuff, but more and more, the loudest parts of modern gaming – the live services explicitly designed to <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-deleted-an-endless-service-game-and-i-am-finally-free-1839326598">monopolize your attention</a>, the market-tested blockbusters <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23428383/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-review-xbox-ps5-pc-battle-net-release-date">devoid of any edge</a>, the constant stream of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/leigh-alexander-power-fantasies-are-boring">power fantasies</a> – bore me. Being old doesn’t make a game good, but when I go back to my favorite retro games, I find a focus and honesty in their design that I don’t see in many of the more acclaimed games of today.</p><p>I took to collecting old games and consoles a couple of years ago – in just one of the many ways the pandemic broke my brain – but actually enjoying those on a modern TV is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/8/1/17630344/retro-video-games-switch-ps4-emulators-nes-classic-crt">notoriously annoying</a>. And while I could always emulate the classics on my phone or PC, I liked the idea of keeping my retro library on a distinct machine, something I could fire up when I’m in the mood but just as easily walk away from when I’m not.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, recently I took my first dip into the world of retro handhelds – portable, often Chinese-made devices designed to house and run emulated games wherever you’d like. I settled on the <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-3-handheld-retro-gaming-system">Retroid Pocket 3</a>, an Android-based model that starts at a relatively affordable $119 and comes from a series that had received mostly positive word of mouth in the past. (It has also been <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXRyb2lkLVBvY2tldC1IYW5kaGVsZC1NdWx0aXBsZS1FbXVsYXRvcnMvZHAvQjBCOFM5Q0w0UD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1iMC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDI1OWIzMGMtNDA0NC00YTc4LWE0ZDEtODk4ZTgwM2MyZmMxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVyLGM2UOSTuWNxxn6nSKm1fAv2k4YoHo-gfNLDvJDmY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRetroid-Pocket-Handheld-Multiple-Emulators%2Fdp%2FB0B8S9CL4P">available on Amazon</a> for $160, typically with faster shipping.)</p><p>Three months later, I’m still happy with it. The Retroid Pocket 3 is one of those “for the price” situations, but, <em>for the price</em>, it’s a fine piece of hardware. If you’ve ever held a Nintendo Switch Lite, the Retroid Pocket 3 will feel like a slightly smaller version of that. It doesn’t have the ergonomic grips of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">Steam Deck</a>, but it’s a smooth slim slab, light and small enough to not feel seriously fatiguing over time, and easily portable.</p><figure><img alt="Retroid's Pocket 3 (bottom) compared to the Nintendo Switch Lite." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/eb77ce40-70f1-11ed-9df9-e1bc66765c9f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Its 4.7-inch display is big and sharp (750x1334) enough for something I hold a foot from my face, and it has a 16:9 aspect ratio that plays nice with remote streaming and more recent platforms like PSP. (It <em>does </em>result in some hefty black bars with older games originally designed for 3:2 or 4:3 displays, but I got used to those quickly enough.) The LED panel isn’t as vibrant as the OLED screens on newer smartphones, but it’s never come off as noticeably compromised either. Its color saturation and brightness is excellent for a cheap handheld, and it’s not impossible to see outside. Plus, it’s a touchscreen, which makes getting around Android easier.</p><p>All the requisite buttons for modern gaming are here as well. There are trade-offs: The four face buttons are beady and on the clicky side, the start/select buttons are placed weirdly on the side, and the triggers aren’t analog, so they can’t respond to different levels of pressure. But everything is fast to actuate and spaced well enough to avoid accidental inputs. The joysticks work as clickable L3 and R3 buttons, too, which isn’t a given with devices like these. I <em>did</em> have an issue with the R1 button sticking down, but that seemed to resolve itself after a couple of days. I’ll chalk that up to the pains of buying from a little-known company.</p><p>If you want the D-pad and face buttons to have a softer feel, Retroid actually includes alternative switches in the box. It sells other <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/diy">replacement parts</a> on its website, too. That’s commendable for a worst-case scenario, but the default should be good enough for most to avoid taking on any DIY risks. One thing that isn’t included, though, is a case; I dug around and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDFEWDhCME9VP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWIwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMjU5YjMwYy00MDQ0LTRhNzgtYTRkMS04OThlODAzYzJmYzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQOoRj7HkIfDh7hm2mBsvsU97IniAW-lvyDuas4ii36m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01DX8B0OU">bought this old one</a> for the PS Vita instead, and it’s done the job.</p><p>Retroid sells the Pocket 3 with either 2GB or 3GB of RAM. The latter only costs $10 more, so there’s little reason not to take the memory boost. The processor in this thing is far from a powerhouse; it’s built to emulate old games that don’t need a ton of processing power and last for 5-6 hours while doing that. Pretty much everything from the 8- and 16-bit eras runs perfectly smooth here, as do lower-power handhelds like the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and even the Nintendo DS. I’ve had few issues with early 3D games from the PlayStation 1 or Sega Dreamcast, too. Getting Nintendo 64 games to work requires a bit of control mapping in your emulator – I mean, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/N64-Controller-Gray.jpg">look at this thing</a> – but once that’s settled, that one is basically perfect as well.</p><figure><img alt="The Retroid game launcher on the Retroid Pocket 3." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/1a7efd80-70f2-11ed-b8fa-ad5455bb343d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Things start to get spottier once you get to the most demanding PSP games – think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War:_Chains_of_Olympus"><em>God of War: Chains of Olympus</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>– but even then I was able to play stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_Stories"><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(which isn’t purchasable on any modern platform) at double its native resolution with only the occasional slowdown. The cut-off here is PlayStation 2 and GameCube – those <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/103503TsnahFfuBKGlFAqC2r69acWaf578I6TEZuZDP4/edit#gid=564961685">generally</a> require just a bit more resources than the Retroid Pocket 3 can supply. But that still leaves decades of gems. Having <em>Super Mario RPG</em> or the original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> playable in my hand, with higher-resolution textures and instant save states, is still kind of surreal.</p><p>The catch, as with many Android handhelds, is actually getting everything to work. When you first load up the Pocket 3, Retroid helpfully suggests a few recommended emulators you can install right away. If you’re new to this, though, you’ll then have to go through a labyrinthine maze of reading <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/01/16/retroid-pocket-2-starter-guide/">massive tutorials</a>, watching 30-minute <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXozVHpDWS1CeTNrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMjU5YjMwYy00MDQ0LTRhNzgtYTRkMS04OThlODAzYzJmYzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATt4ed32UUHYm-lGp-IJPb65rb1pqLdbOIc68wWk3Khv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dz3TzCY-By3k">YouTube videos</a>, tweaking dozens of settings across multiple apps, customizing hotkeys, cross-checking box art, and actually downloading the proper ROM and BIOS files for your games. And that’s not to mention how owning ROM files exists in a legal gray area. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) I spent more time optimizing <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a> and organizing Retroid’s (attractive) launcher in my first two days with the Pocket 3 than actually playing games. There’s a reason <a href="https://hard-drive.net/spend-80-snes-classic-can-install-emulators-raspberry-pi-never-shut-fuck/">people like this</a> are mocked.</p><p>With the busywork done, though, I’ve found digging into my curated selection of the past refreshing. When I go back to <em>NHL ‘94</em>, I see a sports game that respects my time (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fifa-21-ultimate-team-loot-boxes-love-hate-153036039.html">and wallet</a>). When I revisit <em>Ridge Racer Type 4</em>, I see a driving game intently focused on one pleasure (cruising around). When I play <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, I see a sequel in a wildly popular series that isn’t afraid to be weird and take risks. When I return to <em>Shenmue</em>, I see a game that revels in patience and refuses to constantly coddle me. It’s not that <em>no</em> modern games do these things, but it’s fascinating to see what some developers valued with far fewer resources. Here, I can get these history lessons on one handheld, in the span of one night.</p><figure><img alt="The bottom side of the Retroid Pocket 3." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/38bfbdc0-70f2-11ed-b7df-828010aba6ca" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>My only major complaints have less to do with the Pocket 3 than Retroid itself.

The new model has a similar design but 4GB of RAM and a faster processor; it's still not great for GameCube and PS2 emulation by <a href="https://youtu.be/6IF3_8HTeKY?t=1369">most accounts</a>, but it can run <em>more </em>of those games, and it's better with borderline systems like the PSP. At $149, it's now the superior value, though the Pocket 3 remains a fine option for slightly less cash.</p><p>That said, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html">new hardware</a> launches at a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evercade-exp-hands-on-first-look-140037180.html">breakneck pace</a> in this market, and there’s long been a million different ways to play old games.

<p>Fujifilm recently launched the best, albeit most-expensive, APS-C camera yet – <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html">the X-H2S</a>. But it wasn’t done. Today, we’re looking at its stablemate, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTcyNjAxOS1SRUcvZnVqaWZpbG1fMTY3NTcwNDVfeF9oMl9kaWdpdGFsX2NhbWVyYV9ib2R5Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFhMGFmMzhiLTQ2ZGMtNDk5ZC1hZjAyLTc0NzMzZjMzMzljOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUzs0dz9RKhPAQucsv0HEYqr6d6CfJ1EtjgeeDPNf9s1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1726019-REG%2Ffujifilm_16757045_x_h2_digital_camera_body.html">40-megapixel X-H2</a>. It’s the highest-resolution APS-C camera ever released and boasts impressive video powers.</p><p>You can shoot 15 fps RAW photos at full resolution, and it’s the first APS-C mirrorless camera with 8K video. It also offers improved in-body stabilization, an upgraded autofocus system with new AI subject recognition, and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c059428782954e42a273d1af041172a3"></div><p>At $2,000, it’s a full $500 less than the X-H2S, but that’s still a lot for an APS-C camera. With that in mind, I wanted to see if it’s that much better than rivals like Canon’s $1,500 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r7-review-130024472.html">32.5-megapixel EOS R7</a>, and even how it stacks up against full-frame cameras like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">Sony A7 IV</a> or original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">Canon EOS R6</a> that cost just a bit more.</p><h2>Body and handling</h2><p>Other than the fact that the X-H2S has an “S” logo painted on the front, the X-H2 looks identical. It even weighs the same at 660 grams, or slightly more than the X-T4. That’s up there in full-frame territory, so it’s not exactly a pocketable street camera like other Fuji models.</p><p>Most Fujifilm cameras also have multiple dials for shutter speed, ISO and exposure compensation, but not the X-H2. Instead, it’s more like Canon, Sony and Nikon models, with front and rear dials, a mode selector, a joystick and a D-pad control. As a nod to street photographers who shoot from the hip, it does have a top screen that displays aperture, shutter speeds and other key info.</p><p>I was never a huge fan of the classic Fujifilm layout because it’s not ideal for video, so I like the X-H2 layout – but I know that many Fuji fans don’t.</p><p>I also love the fully articulating 3-inch, 1.5 million dot display, which makes it easier to shoot low and high-angle photos or selfies. The new X-T5, which packs the same 40-megapixel sensor, has a display that’s limited to tilting. Meanwhile, the 5.76-million dot, 120Hz EVF is nice and sharp and offers blackout-free shooting in silent electronic shutter mode.</p><p>Like its namesake, the X-H2 has a high-speed USB-C port with power delivery, along with microphone and headphone ports. You also get a full-sized HDMI port, which should be more robust than the fiddly micro-HDMI inputs found on rival cameras. That was a smart decision by Fujifilm, because external RAW video is a key feature on this camera.</p><p>Battery life is slightly reduced compared to the X-H2S, with 680 shots per charge instead of 720 – not surprising considering the extra resolution. And it has both UHS-II and high-speed CFexpress memory card slots. The latter is required for high-resolution ProRes video and to reduce buffering when shooting 15 fps, 40-megapixel bursts.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt="Fujifilm X-H2 review gallery" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/e4831d82-7cbb-11ed-9def-12fab046a8ff" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Normally, high-resolution cameras are among the most expensive models. However, the 26.2-megapixel X-H2S actually costs more than the 40-megapixel X-H2. That’s because it has a stacked sensor that delivers extra speeds and reduces rolling shutter in silent shooting mode.</p><p>Rolling shutter isn’t a huge issue on the X-H2 for photos, though. It’s actually faster in mechanical than electronic shutter mode, with full-resolution RAW bursts up to 15 fps compared to 13 fps. That’s impressive, considering it’s designed more for detail than speed.</p><p>What’s more, you won’t need silent mode often because the mechanical shutter is among the quietest I’ve ever heard. And if you really do need the electronic shutter, rolling shutter is present for fast moving subjects, but surprisingly well controlled. It’s considerably better than other APS-C cameras like Sony’s A6600 or the Canon EOS R7.</p><p>The autofocus system can keep up with the burst speeds as well. It sticks tenaciously to subjects, giving a decent hit rate even if they’re moving quickly. It’s not quite as accurate as Sony’s AF, though, particularly when light levels drop.</p><figure><img alt="Fujifilm X-H2 review gallery" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/e4828141-7cbb-11ed-bdde-fe16e5d46e2f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like the S model, the X-H2 has new AI smarts, with the ability to track birds and animals, along with cars, motorcycles, bikes, airplanes and trains. Face and eye detection is much improved over past models like the X-T4 too, tracking subjects smoothly and reliably.</p><p>I’d certainly choose the X-H2S over the X-H2 for sports and wildlife, as the stacked sensor lets you shoot at an awesome 40 fps. Sony and Canon’s latest cameras beat them both, though, as they have superior AI and the autofocus is smoother and more reliable. Still, the X-H2 offers good autofocus and burst performance considering the high resolution.</p><p>The 7-stop in-body stabilization also worked well, letting me capture sharp shots handheld down to about a quarter second. And if 40 megapixels isn’t enough, you can take 160-megapixel photos with a tripod using Fuijfilm’s Pixel Shift Combiner feature.</p><h2>Image quality</h2><p>The X-H2’s 40-megapixel X-Trans backside-illuminated sensor may not be stacked, but it’s a new state-of-the-art sensor. And it really delivers where it counts in terms of image quality.</p><p>To start with, the extra pixels give you more detail that’s useful if you need to crop in or make large prints. And yet, the extra resolution doesn’t hurt image quality in low light at higher ISO settings. Noise is well controlled at ISO 6400, and images are usable at up to ISO 12800 if exposure is set correctly.</p><p>In-camera processing of JPEG and 10-bit HEIF files is impeccable, with pleasant, accurate colors and a nice balance of noise reduction and detail. If I wanted to share photos right away, I could often do it with no need for any processing.</p><p>The X-H2 can take uncompressed, lossless or compressed RAW photos with 14 bits of color. That gives plenty of room for fine-tuning, even in bright or dark areas. However,  if you underexpose shots and try to boost levels, noise can get out of hand. That’s one of the main drawbacks of APS-C compared to full-frame sensors, of course.</p><section><img alt="Fujifilm X-H2 review sample image gallery" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2958d6d0-7cbb-11ed-afd9-12b8216e2b02" /></section><p>And of course, the X-H2 offers Fujifilm’s full array of film simulation modes. You can experiment with popular looks like Velvia, Eterna or Acros black and white, and still have a full-color RAW backup. They’re not for everyone, but I love them.</p><h2>Video</h2><p>The X-H2S is still the best APS-C camera for video, mostly because of the extra speed and reduced rolling shutter. But the X-H2 is superior in a couple of ways. It gives you more resolution, up to 8K at up to 30 fps, along with supersampled 6.2K 16:9 (no 3:2) and supersampled 4K HQ at up to 30 fps. Subsampled 4K can also be shot at up to 60 fps with some loss of detail, while 240 fps super slow-mo is available at 1080p.</p><p>All of these resolutions can be saved in three 10-bit ProRes codecs, HQ, standard and LT. These offer more quality and are easier to edit than the 8-bit H.264 and 10-bit H.265 codecs. And the choice of three gives users the choice between quality and smaller, more manageable file sizes. They use high data rates that peak at an enormous 3,520 MBps, though, so you must record them to high-speed CFexpress cards.</p><p>F-Log and F-Log2 picture modes are also on tap, though processing is done at 12-bit rather than 14-bit as with the X-H2S – so the latter offers a bit more dynamic range. And you can save either ProRes or Blackmagic RAW video to Atomos or Blackmagic external recorders at up to 8K for more robust files that are easier to adjust later on.</p><figure><img alt="Fujifilm X-H2 review gallery" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/e446fee0-7cbb-11ed-bf6f-127dae0b978a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Even with regular ProRes or H.265, I had plenty of room for creative color correction and shot adjustments. Color reproduction favors accuracy on the X-H2, with pleasant and accurate skin tones. Shooting at ISOs down to 6400 is feasible, with noise becoming an issue beyond that.</p><p>As with the S model, autofocus is much improved over other Fujifilm cameras, though still not up to par with Canon and Sony. It generally tracked subjects well, but could occasionally lose focus. While bird and animal tracking tended to be erratic, eye and face tracking was reliable.</p><p>Rolling shutter for video is more of an issue on the X-H2 than the X-H2s due to the lack of a stacked sensor. It’s especially pronounced with full shutter readouts at 8K, 6.2K and 4K HQ. You’ll want to be careful to avoid fast pans, and you’ll see a fair amount of skew when shooting objects that move rapidly across the frame. Still, it’s not actually not nearly as bad as I expected, and far better than on Sony’s A6600 and other APS-C cameras.</p><p>Overheating can be an issue at 8K with the X-H2, though Fujifilm hasn’t said exactly how long you can shoot at that resolution. If you’re planning to do that, though, you can buy a small fan that screws to the back to allow 8K filming for extended periods.</p><p>Finally, as with most cameras, the in-body stabilization is really only good for stationary handheld video. Video can jolt while vlogging or doing other rapid actions, even with the electronic assist turned on.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="Fujifilm X-H2 review gallery" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/e482a850-7cbb-11ed-8bf7-c96866b1d27d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>After testing both of Fujifilm’s latest cameras, I think the X-H2 is a better option for most people simply because it’s a better value. While not as fast as the X-H2S, it offers an ideal balance between image quality and speed. And for video, it’s better if you need the highest resolution and sharpest video possible.</p><p>$2,000 is a lot for a crop-sensor camera, though. For that, you could get a full-frame camera like Canon’s $2,100 EOS R6 or spend $500 less on the EOS R7 APS-C camera. It’s also a tough sell against Fujifilm’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t5-camera-price-release-date-141508004.html">$1,700 X-T5</a>, which uses the same 40-megapixel sensor but has manual dials that many fans of the brand prefer.</p><p>Still, it’s a better video camera than either the A7 IV, EOS R6 and X-T5, thanks to the 8K, RAW output, fully-articulating screen and more. And with Fujifilm’s deep lens lineup that’s considerably cheaper than full-frame glass, the X-H2 will likely cost you less than any full-frame camera in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer</em> shows and films may be coming to Prime Video in the next few years. Amazon has secured the global rights to <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/henry-cavill-star-warhammer-40000-film-tv-franchise-amazon-studios-1235200833/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, and Henry Cavill is set to star in and executive produce the franchise. The company's confirmation comes after the <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/2022/12/16/agreement-in-principle-to-develop-film-and-tv/">announcement</a> by Games Workshop, the manufacturer behind the miniature wargame, that it has &quot;reached an agreement in principle&quot; with Amazon. It's unclear if the two companies have already worked out the details of their partnership, but Games Workshop said it's giving Amazon the rights to develop films and TV series based on the IP, along with any associated merchandising rights. <em>Deadline</em> lists games and animation as other potential projects.</p><p>The tabletop wargame has been around since 1987 and is set in the distant future with a rich lore that encompasses humans, alien races and gods. Based on <em>Deadline's</em> report, production company Vertigo Entertainment teamed up with Cavill, who once <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/henry-cavill-painting-warhammer-40k-miniatures/">posted a photo</a> of himself painting a <em>Warhammer</em> miniature in the middle of pandemic lockdowns, to secure the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> IP before bringing the project to Amazon. Cavill recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-renews-the-witcher-season-four-recasts-geralt-of-rivia-201602903.html">left The Witcher</a>, where he played Geralt of Rivia, and was supposed to play Superman in future DC films. However, he was ultimately dropped as the superhero after DC Studios' new co-chairman James Gunn decided to write a movie for a younger Man of Steel.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement, Cavill said: &quot;I have loved <em>Warhammer</em> since I was a boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honour and the responsibility. I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon Studios and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh on lifelong dream come true.&quot;</p>

## The Morning After: Dell’s modular laptop concept can be dismantled in seconds

<p>With no cables or screws, Dell’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-sustainable-concept-luna-laptop-dismantled-seconds-140006712.html">latest Concept Luna</a> device is pretty compelling. It’s a laptop you can take apart in around 30 seconds, using just a push-pin tool. And we’re talking about replacing the entire keyboard, processor or display because it’s entirely modular.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-sustainable-concept-luna-laptop-dismantled-seconds-140006712.html"><figure><img alt="Dell" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3ceccb00-7d3a-11ed-bfda-d11a4cd502e2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure></a><p>When it's all put together, the new Concept Luna looks like a typical Dell laptop (more a Latitude than a slim XPS, to be clear). The new Luna laptop also has room for a CPU fan, to house more powerful processors. Once you’ve replaced a part, it does take longer to boot up, as it, sensibly, has to run through multiple tests to ensure each part works like it should.</p><p>We’ve seen modular tech for PCs and even smartphones come and go, but can Dell make this stick? The ability to replace components on, say, an army of enterprise laptops for a company could create huge savings for both the environment and the corporate bottom line.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html">The best VR headsets for 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-god-of-war-series-will-focus-on-events-leading-up-to-ragnarok-105515632.html">Amazon's God of War series will tell the story of the 2018 Norse reboot </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-games-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-173848481.html">Amazon will publish the next Tomb Raider game</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-senate-approves-bill-ban-tiktok-government-devices-075852696.html">US Senate approves bill to ban TikTok on government devices </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-1-us-beta-testing-program-android-13-171906968.html">Nothing Phone (1) heading to the US in Android 13 'testing program' </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mythic-quest-spinoff-apple-tv-plus-meme-mortals-192207925.html">'Mythic Quest' is getting an Apple TV+ spinoff series</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-white-house-has-restarted-its-free-covid-test-by-mail-program-202054801.html">The White House has restarted its free COVID-19 test by mail program</a></p></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-journalists-who-cover-elon-musk-015038157.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><br />Twitter suspends journalists who cover the social network and Elon Musk</a></h2><h3>Musk insinuated they were suspended due to Twitter's new doxxing rules.</h3><h3></h3><p>Twitter suspended several journalists from various publications last night.

## Microsoft brings full Teams integration to HoloLens 2

<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hololens-2-industrial-metaverse/">latest update for the HoloLens 2</a> makes it easier for users to collaborate with colleagues. One of the biggest additions is perhaps the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510670/microsoft-hololens-2-teams-features-integration">full integration of Microsoft Teams</a>, because users will no longer have to hop on a computer or a phone to attend meetings with the rest of their organization. While the headset has had the capability to make and receive Teams video calls for years, its collaborative features were still pretty limited.&nbsp;</p><p>With this new update, Microsoft is giving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-microsoft-hololens-2-hands-on-mixed-reality.html">HoloLens 2</a> users the capability to display an array of holographic windows with Teams calls, chats and calendars. Since the update also adds OneDrive integration, users will be able to access their cloud-based folders and see Word documents, PDFs and videos shared during calls.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft has also combined its two Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality apps, namely the Dynamics 365 Guides app that provides step-by-step holographic instructions to users and the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app that lets frontline workers show colleagues what they're seeing in the field. The company said the combined application was a priority request from Toyota, which has been providing feedback for the headset since 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>David Kleiner, who leads Toyota North America's Applied Technology &amp; Research Lab, explained that giving frontline workers laptops won't work, because they don't have desk jobs and that using a device they can wear with all the tools they need is much more practical. &quot;Someone can grab a HoloLens, start a Guides session, and literally have a trainer in their head,&quot; Kleiner said. &quot;If they do need help, they can call an expert right from the app.&quot;</p><p>In addition to discussing the headset's new capabilities, Microsoft also said that it would release a successor to the current iteration. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-killed-plans-for-hololens-3-080308825.html">Reports earlier this year</a> claimed that the tech giant scrapped its plans for the HoloLens 3 and that it was going to be the end for the device. Microsoft, however, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hololens-alex-kipman-195733296.html">denied</a> that it was killing the HoloLens and called it &quot;critical part of [the company's] plans for emerging categories like mixed reality and the metaverse.&quot; Now, Microsoft mixed reality VP Scott Evans said that the company is &quot;just looking for the right design point to make it a meaningful update&quot; because &quot;[customers] want a successor device that's going to enable an even higher return on investment.&quot;</p>

## 'Hitman' players can soon port their Stadia saves to other platforms

<p>With Stadia set to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">shut down</a> next month, players have been understandably worried about losing game progress on the platform. Now, developer IO Interactive has <a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-stadia-carryover/">announced</a> that Stadia <em>Hitman - World of Assassination</em> players will be able to import save data into all other platforms including PC, Xbox and PlayStation.&nbsp;</p><p>IOI said it will release a transfer tool a week before the Stadia shutdown, set for January 18th. If you play the game on Stadia, you can start to prepare in advance by linking your IOI account to your Stadia account. This needs to be done before the Stadia shutdown, or you'll lose your save data. Once the accounts are linked, though, you'll have an extra month (until February 17th) to complete the transfer.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4f194397ed9d4ac2870c55c9e63b059f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're taking action to help HITMAN players on <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleStadia</a> save their progress. <br /><br />Find out how:<a href="https://t.co/Ouhl1nMzmC">https://t.co/Ouhl1nMzmC</a><a href="https://t.co/WDjwV32vYv">pic.twitter.com/WDjwV32vYv</a></p>— HITMAN 3 (@Hitman) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1603391958273200130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The developer said the &quot;majority&quot; of your Stadia achievements will be carried over, including your &quot;player profile, XP, suits, items and mastery levels.&quot; IOI noted that there are &quot;compatibility issues&quot; between Stadia and other achievement systems, so it's focusing on achievements related to progression as a priority. Unfortunately, &quot;your leaderboard positions, save games and created contracts will NOT be carried over during the Stadia progression carryover,&quot; it added.</p><p>IOI joins other developers offering one-time progress transfers. Last month, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1">wrote</a> that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Stadia players could transfer game saves over to PC, and Bethesda announced something similar for <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/63077"><em>Elder Scrolls Online</em></a>. In September, Ubisoft said that Stadia users could transfer all their purchases to PC, but didn't confirm if game progress would carry over.&nbsp;</p>

## Tokyo will require new housing projects to install solar panels starting in 2025

<p>Many new homes built in Tokyo will require solar panels to be installed starting in April 2025, <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/12/3c10f9876521-tokyo-to-require-new-homes-be-fitted-with-solar-panels-from-fy-2025.html"><em>Kyodo News</em></a> has reported. The local assembly passed <a href="https://www.kankyo.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/climate/solar_portal/index.html">new regulations</a> requiring major construction companies to equip homes smaller than 2,000 square meters (21,500 square feet) with solar panels or other renewable power sources. The measure is the first of its kind in Japan and aims to cut the city's carbon emissions in half.&nbsp;</p><p>The government estimates that the 980,000 yen ($7,200) price of a 4kW installation can be recouped in about six years based on utility bill savings and an existing 100,000 yen ($728) per kW grant. Leasing costs will also be reduced through other subsidies, according to an <a href="https://www.kankyo.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/climate/solar_portal/document.files/basic_policy.pdf">information-packed slide deck (PDF)</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The measure applies only to around 50 builders who supply over 20,000 square meters (215,000 square feet) to the market, so it's not clear what percentage of new homes will fall under the new rules. The measure should have a major effect, though, as the Tokyo government estimates that half of existing buildings (70 percent of which are homes) will be replaced with new construction by 2050.&nbsp;</p><p>New construction starts in Japan averaged around 800,000-900,000 per year from 2012 to 2021, and a handful of major contractors called <em>Super Zenecon</em> dominate the construction sector, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/667933/japan-top-housing-construction-companies/"><em>Statista</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Japan is the world's fifth largest producer of carbon emissions, but has promised to be carbon neutral by 2050. It's not the only country mandating solar installations. In France, lawmakers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/france-new-law-parking-lots-solar-panels-100435214.html">recently approved</a> a bill requiring parking lots with a minimum of 80 spaces to be covered by solar panels. The French government said the plan, aimed primarily at parking lots off freeways and major routes, could generate up to 11 gigawatts — the equivalent of 10 nuclear reactors.</p>

## 'Death Stranding' will get a movie adaptation

<p>Kojima Productions is working with LA-based Hammerstone Studios to develop a movie adaptation of <em>Death Stranding</em>. The 2019 action game already provides quite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">a cinematic experience</a> with lengthy cut scenes and dramatic expositions, which is probably part of the reason why they aren't directly adapting its story into film. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/death-stranding-movie-game-hideo-kojima-1235462406/"><em>Variety</em></a>, the movie will introduce new elements and characters into the <em>Death Stranding</em> world, so we will see something fresh at the very least, even if they don't create a brand new story for the big screen.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is set in an apocalyptic version of the United States, where invisible creatures called &quot;Beached Things&quot; showed up and triggered nuclear bomb-like explosions. <em>Death Stranding </em>was a star-studded production, since Kojima chose to get known actors to play its characters. Norman Reedus portrayed Sam Porter Bridges, the game's protagonist that the player controls. The game also stars Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux and even uses the likeness of director Guillermo del Toro. It's unclear if any of the actors in the game will also appear in the film.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hideo Kojima will serve as the film's executive producer, along with Hammerstone co-founder Alex Lebovici. &quot;We are thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to partner with brilliant and iconic Hideo Kojima on his first film adaptation,&quot; Lebovici said in a statement. &quot;Unlike other big budget tentpole video game adaptations, this will be something far more intimate and grounded. Our goal is to redefine what a video game adaptation could be when you have creative and artistic freedom. This film will be an authentic ‘Hideo Kojima’ production.&quot;</p><p>This announcement comes after Kojima announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kojima-new-game-overdose-death-stranding-021847290.html"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a> at The Game Awards. The upcoming sequel is just as star-studded as the first game, with Norman Reedus reprising his role, Léa Seydoux coming back and Elle Fanning playing a character that still remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p>
