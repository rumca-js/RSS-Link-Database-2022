Officers from the special unit of Belgium\u2019s federal police gathered on Rue Wiertz, close to the European parliament in Brussels. The parliament, which likes to style itself the house of European democracy, had been at the centre of a months-long, top-secret investigation.

As soon as Giorgi left the building, police surrounded him. His interrogation \u2013 and seizure of his phone \u2013 was deemed crucial to the investigation, according to Le Soir, which recounted the details of his morning arrest.

I swam, read a couple of books, drank cocktails of varying quality and got a massage every day.</p><p>I also did a lot of yoga. On day two of the trip, a friend took me to a studio called Radiantly Alive (this is the vibe of Ubud) for a 90-minute hatha class. I had done yoga precisely once before, at a Fitness First inside a Canberra shopping mall. This was a very different experience. I stood in a large room surrounded by beautiful Balinese nature, sunlight and a gentle breeze filtering in through the open windows, some kind of chillout mix on the speakers. I didn\u2019t know my happy babies from my downward dogs, but nonetheless emerged from the class limber and in a state of bliss.

Quite apart from the usual suspects of relapse, overdose, Aids and suicide, the incidence of death through cancer and heart disease have been far higher among the addicts I know than other people. It might just be a coincidence but I suspect not. My dad, towards the end of his life, used to say that old age wasn\u2019t for wimps. I\u2019m beginning to know how he felt.

It\u2019s a love letter to the movies, inevitably, though I remember Chazelle\u2019s previous films being love letters to actual human beings. There are preemptive references to Singin\u2019 in the Rain and it climaxes with a swoony-solemn Oscar-telecast-type montage including clips from Maya Deren\u2019s Meshes of the Afternoon and James Cameron\u2019s Terminator 2. Funny though Babylon often is, in all its frantic melodrama it is weirdly without the gentle romantic sweetness and believable human frailty in his Oscar-winning film La La Land (although there are musical echoes of that earlier picture and the same message that jazz is where integrity is to be found in showbusiness).</p><p>Chazelle is also concerned to restore some of the minorities who have been erased in Hollywood\u2019s history, as well as be more candid about the sordid realities, but he fudges the new #MeToo conversation about the Hollywood golden age: all the raunchy sex here is very much consensual. Pundits have cited silent movie historian and evangelist Kevin Brownlow in relation to this film, but the debt is obviously more to Kenneth Anger, author of Hollywood Babylon \u2013 and frankly even more to Baz Luhrmann than either. The outrageous party scenes, with the mandatory overhead shots showing the ecstatically unclothed women crowd-surfing face-up are so much like Luhrmann he should be getting a royalty cheque.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/babylon-review-hollywood-brad-pitt-margot-robbie\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/16/babylon-review-hollywood-brad-pitt-margot-robbie", "date_published": "2022-12-16 08:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "The week in wildlife \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>The best of this week\u2019s wildlife pictures, including hungry puppies, a snow leopard and migratory birds</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2022/dec/16/the-week-in-wildlife-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2022/dec/16/the-week-in-wildlife-in-pictures", "date_published": "2022-12-16 08:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Watered down: why negotiators at Cop15 are barely mentioning the ocean", "description": "<p>With only two mentions of the word \u2018ocean\u2019 in the latest 5,000-word working agreement, delegates fear marine biodiversity is being sacrificed</p><p>The ocean may cover 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface and contain much of its animal life, but you might not get that impression from the UN discussions in Montreal to save global biodiversity.
