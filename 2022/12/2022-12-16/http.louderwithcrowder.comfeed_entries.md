This is what Keith Olbermann has been reduced to. Pretending he is a dog.</p><p>Olbermann was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-suspends-journalists" target="_blank">one of the dinkuses yeeted off of Twitter</a> on Thursday night. Musk suspended @ElonJet for tracking his IRL whereabouts. Twitter opposes doxxing, and unlike Old Twitter, Musk applies the rules to everyone. Keith Olbermann had the idea that people should mass Tweet a picture of Musk's whereabouts because Elon can't suspend them all. Musk showed that, yes, <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-elon-musk-joins-twitter-space-with-woke-journalists-informs-them-theyre-not-special-doxxing-rules-apply-to-them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he can in fact ban them all</a>.</p><p>Keithums was reduced to the most pathetic self-own imaginable. Tweeting from his dog's account. I have this video saved for posterity's sake in case this account gets kyboshed too. If I was Elon, I'd leave it up over how lame and sad it is. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"Doubt you've heard but Musk banned me permanently from Twitter for NOT doing something he said WASN'T against the rules!"<br /><br />"It was the baptism scene from The Godfather and Elon Muskleone"<br /><br />LISTEN TO FRIDAY'S POST/SUSPENSION COUNTDOWN HERE and PLEASE RT! <a href="https://t.co/4Qp9MpgzQr">https://t.co/4Qp9MpgzQr</a> <a href="https://t.co/HiB8NYTKDV">pic.twitter.com/HiB8NYTKDV</a><br />— Keith Olbermann's Dogs (@TomJumboGrumbo) <a href="https://twitter.com/TomJumboGrumbo/status/1603644568724979714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Olbermann will always have a special place in my heart because he was the topic of my first "assignment" from Crowder. He and I were first introduced at an Andrew Breitbart party the last time CPAC was in DC. Crowder was hosting the conference the next morning and asked if I would mind tweeting that I saw Olbermann in the lobby.</p><p>I was one of two in the bloggers' lounge bright and early the following morning and did the job for my new friend. Five seconds later, the other blogger grabbed his camera and DARTED out of the lounge. When he came back out of breath he said "someone said Keith Olbermann was in the lobby."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Students threatened with suspension, forbidden from taking any more photos of Kayla Lemieux

The beautiful and brave educator first strutted into content glory when video of her and her comically large fake chesticles (with even more comically larger fake nipples) was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canadian-teacher-poolside" target="_self">seen teaching high school students how to use a circular saw</a>. You may think that violates the dress code, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board-wins">but the school board feels otherwise</a>.</p><p><em>Quick admonishment, in the past we have reported Lemieux's prosthetics gave her size HHH breasts. Turns out, they are only a size Z. We here at the Louder with Crowder website regret the error.</em></p><p>While Lemieux is free to live her best life, students are no longer allowed to capture any of it for posterity's sake. <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-students-not-to-take-pictures-of-trans-shop-teacher" target="_blank">They have been threatened with suspension</a> if they take any more photos or videos of Mx. Lemieux.</p><p>The final straw seemed to be these recent videos. In one Lemieux -- who besides teaching shop, is also a substitute -- walking around on crutches <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-skydiving" target="_blank">after her well-publicized skydiving trip</a>. In another, Lemieux is seen counseling a vaping student. No word on if she also took a hit.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<small class="image-media media-caption">TRANS SHOP TEACHER: Students warned not to take her picture</small>

</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/15/trans-teacher-with-z-sized-prosthetic-breasts-sparks-photo-ban/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a> has another photo taken by a student which shows Lemieux slaying in purple as she is handing out an assignment. Though I wonder, while the top has been deemed acceptable by the school board, if the shorty shorts might be too short for a high school.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="847f6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32356175&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The length of the suspension and any other consequences levied at students is unknown. For some reason, high school students find a substitute teacher with giant size Z prosthetic breasts to be fascinating. You would think their wanting to document the teacher would be trans-forward. That sharing these videos and photos would illustrate how inclusive and tolerant the student body is of Mx. Lemieux's beautiful bravery. </p><p>Sadly, the high school doesn't see it that way. The students have been warned not to capture any more content. A few rebels opted to take photos anyway. </p><p>We tip our hat to these civically disobedient patriots. Or, whatever passes for a "patriot" in Canada.</p><p><p>

Twitter opposes doxxing, and unlike Old Twitter, Musk applies the rules to everyone. Keith Olbermann had the idea that people should mass Tweet a picture of Musk's whereabouts because Elon can't suspend them all. Alleged "legit" journalists from CNN, NYT, and elsewhere did what Olbermann told them to.

Everyone’s gonna be treated the same. You’re not special because you’re a journalist. You’re just, on Twitter you’re just a citizen, so no special treatment. <br /><br />You dox, you get suspended, end of story. And ban evasion, or trying to be clever about it, like ‘I posted a link to the real time information,’ that is obviously simply trying to evade the meaning. That’s no different from actually sharing real time information.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="64e1d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32355441&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Could Elon Musk banning journalismers be a slippery slope to other people getting banned? Sure, I guess. While I like a lot of what Musk has been doing, I'm mostly here for the content. If we do go down that slippery slope, the worst thing that happens is that Twitter sucks as much as it always had. Meh.</p><p>But for the longest time, activist journalismers were treated like a protected class on the bird app. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/learn-code-meme" target="_blank">They could tell out-of-work coalminers they should learn to code</a>. But when users started to tell out-of-work reporters they should learn to code, reporters got Twitter to declare it "harassment" and "hate speech." And those users were kicked off of the platform for hurting journalismers' fragile fee-fees.</p><p>There are free speech implications for what Elon did, and down the road, there might be cause for concern. As of this morning, I am laughing too hard to have any.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk lays out his reasons for suspending alleged 'journalists' from Twitter

Even though Old Twitter <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2022/08/23/paul_sperry_fbi_trump_raid_scif.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended journalists all the time</a>, Old Twitter didn't believe in free speech so it was accepted. Elon does, and this doesn't sound very free speechy of him. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d4d50" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32354877&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The TL;DR backstory is that there was a dude tweeting the real-time location of where Elon Musk's jet was. He got suspended for doxxing IRL locations of another Twitter user (Musk). Shortly after, a crazed stalker allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/15/elon-musk-shares-video-of-crazy-stalker-who-climbed-vehicle-carrying-moguls-son/" target="_blank">came for Musk's two-year-old son</a>.  Reporters, to flaunt Musk's anti-doxxing rule, started tweeting screen captures of Musk's whereabouts. Again, allegedly. Their accounts have all been suspended so I can't check.</p><p>It's not unlike when the Babylon Bee was suspended for tweeting a joke about Biden administration official Rachel Levine. Others posted the same joke, and Twitter suspended them claiming it was dangerous to joke about Biden administration official Rachel Levine.

<p>Elon Musk explained his rationale:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603587970832793600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">If anyone posted real-time locations & addresses of NYT reporters, FBI would be investigating, there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill & Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603602018727104513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Old Twitter didn't believe in free speech and was a private company (even though it was public) and could do whatever it wanted. New Twitter believes in free speech and while a private company, is told by government and government-stanning institutions it can't do whatever it wants.<br /></p><p>Do I think Musk should be suspending journalists? No. </p><p>Do I feel bad that these assclowns and others like them are suspended? Meh.</p><p><p>
