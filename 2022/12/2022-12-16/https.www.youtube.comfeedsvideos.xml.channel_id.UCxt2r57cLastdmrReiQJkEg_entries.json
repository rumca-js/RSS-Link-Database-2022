Come the holidays, families and friendship groups worldwide will around their dining room tables and do their best to bankrupt one another. Until, that is, someone inevitably snaps and flips the board.\n\nMonopoly and its associated iconography including \u201cMr. Monopoly\u201d (or Rich Uncle Pennybags as he was once officially called), the \u201cGo\u201d corner, \u201cGo to Jail\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk\u201d (or \u201cMayfair\u201d in the UK edition) is iconic. And, those icons are often presented as a celebration of contemporary capitalism; such as when they\u2019re used in the regular McDonalds Monopoly partnership.\n\nBut, what if I was to tell you that what we today know as Monopoly was actually created as a critique of capitalism rather than as a celebration of it? That Monopoly was in fact designed as an ingenious piece of anti-landlord propaganda?\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to explore how an activist from Oregon called Lizzie Magie was inspired by the economic and political theories of Henry George to create The Landlord\u2019s Game. And how a salesman called Charles Darrow got rich by stealing her invention.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tom_nicholas\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\nBoard Images courtesy Thomas Forsyth: https://landlordsgame.info\n\n#Monopoly #BoardGames #Propaganda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7nFA19Gzrw", "date_published": "2022-12-16 20:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
