## Best Of 2022: God Of War Ragnarok's Twist On Norse Mythology Is An Excellent Subversion

<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers ahead for God of War and God of War Ragnarok</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">"Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical," Mimir explains to Kratos and his son Atreus in 2018's God of War. Yet as soon as Sindri, the dwarven blacksmith, gave a bundle of mistletoe arrows to the young god, I knew Baldur's fate was sealed.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not an expert on Norse mythology, but the fables of Odin, Thor, the giants, and Vanir are something I've had an interest in for a number of years now. I know the broad strokes surrounding Ragnarok and some of the smaller myths, ranging from the story of Thor creating the tides after being tricked into drinking the ocean, to the tale of the construction of Asgard's walls--which ends with Loki being impregnated by a horse, incidentally. While some players were wondering how Kratos was ever going to stop an unkillable god, I knew the answer was already sitting right in front of us, neatly docked on Atreus' quiver. The exact details of Baldur's eventual demise may differ in God of War compared to the Norse mythology it pulls from, but mistletoe--and by extension, Atreus--still play a crucial role in the death of its fearsome antagonist.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnaroks-twist-on-norse-mythology-is-an-excellent-subversion/1100-6510121/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Best Of 2022: Neon White Wants You To Break It By Design

<p dir="ltr">For a year that's had a lot of games delayed, 2022 has been kind of a belter year, with expertly crafted games like the obvious GOTY contender Elden Ring to the intricate narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper. But no game better exemplifies "game feel" as a concept than Neon White. It's tight, it's fast, it has the best soundtrack of the year. Most interestingly though, is the game's secret goal: It wants you to break it on purpose.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're unfamiliar with Neon White, let me catch you up to speed (pun very intended) on one of GameSpot's picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2022/2900-4517/">10 best games of the year</a>. It's a first-person shooter-platformer, with cards that can either be used as weapons, which you use to take down demons, or discarded as a resource for various abilities like a dash or an extra jump. You'll want to be quick on your feet, though, because getting the fastest time possible is your main aim.</p><p dir="ltr">The level design is obviously one of the standout aspects of the game, because while the thing you're doing is platforming, the game is really more like a puzzle game, as you come to understand where you need to use a weapon, or where you need to use an ability.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neon-white-wants-you-to-break-it-by-design/1100-6510000/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem spent years in relative obscurity in the West, known mostly for the appearance of some swordfighters in Super Smash Bros. Melee. That changed in 2013 with the release of Fire Emblem: Awakening, the series' first big breakout hit in North America. Since then the tactical RPG has become one of Nintendo's most popular and critically-acclaimed series. The latest entry in the series, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, was named one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-games-of-2019-fire-emblem-three-houses/1100-6472143/">Best Games of 2019</a>. So needless to say, a new Fire Emblem is enough to get us very excited.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Engage is that new game, a fresh entry in the long-running series that pays special homage to its own history. This game centers a major story and gameplay mechanic around summoning characters from past Fire Emblem games, letting us see some of our favorites or learn about characters from games that passed us by. Here's everything we know about Fire Emblem Engage.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Like many anthology RPG series, Fire Emblem doesn't necessarily have one continuous narrative from game to game, but each game does share some common traits. In Fire Emblem Engage, 1000 years have passed since four kingdoms cooperated with each other and with heroes from other worlds to seal away the Fell Dragon on the continent of Elyos. As the evil prepares to reawaken, you emerge as Alear the Divine Dragon, a chosen hero who can bring back the heroes from other realms and seal the chaos dragon again.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-everything-we-know/1100-6510145/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Super Mario Bros. Movie: Everything We Know About The Animated Nintendo Film Starring Chris Pratt

<p><h2>Everything We Know About The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074860-nsmbm-mario-luigi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros. movie that hit theaters in 1993 was nothing like what anyone expected. While the games were bright, colorful, and fun, Super Mario Bros. was a dark, bleak dystopian movie where Goombas were humanoid dinosaurs with shrunken heads, Yoshi was a literal dinosaur, and Bowser--then King Koopa--was a human-dinosaur hybrid played by Dennis Hopper. There's a possibly apocryphal story of Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto watching the movie and smiling at the end and saying that he's okay with it because no one will mistake it as having anything to do with his games.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, Nintendo has avoided the big screen. There have been rumors of Metroid and Zelda movies being options from time to time, but we didn't get anything solid until Nintendo announced The Super Mario Bros. Movie, along with its cast, headlined by Chris Pratt. The movie's casting has received criticism from every corner of the internet.</p><p>Actors like Jack Black, Seth Rogen, and Charlie Day have largely been welcomed by fans, but Pratt has been derided by everyone from Mario fans who want to see longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet get his time in the sun, to moviegoers who have tired of Chris Pratt's increasingly uninspired performances in movies like Jurassic World: Dominion, to Super Mario Bros. movie alum John Leguizamo, who has spoken out about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-super-mario-bros-star-john-leguizamo-criticizes-new-mario-movie-for-being-all-white/1100-6496635/">lack of diversity</a> in the cast. Pratt assured fans that his Mario voice wouldn't be just his normal voice and would be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-pratt-declares-his-mario-voice-is-unlike-anything-youve-ever-heard/1100-6504882/">unlike anything you've ever heard</a>," but fans have found the trailer to suggest otherwise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>What's the release date?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074858-nsmbm-karts.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-delayed-to-2023/1100-6502796/"><strong>April 7, 2023</strong></a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Who's directing?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074857-nsmbm-donkeykong.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Aaron Horvath and Michael Jeleinc, who have both worked on the Teen Titans Go series among other things, are directing the Super Mario Bros. Movie for Illumination, the studio best known for the Minions characters.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Who's starring?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074859-nsmbm-mario.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a star-studded cast headed by Chris Pratt and Anya Taylor-Joy as Mario and Princess Peach. Charlie Day plays Luigi, Jack Black plays Bowser, and Keegan-Michael Key rounds out the primary cast as Toad. Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen play Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong respectively. Charles Martinet, who has provided the voice for Mario in the games for over two decades, will have a cameo appearance somewhere in the film.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>What do we know about the story?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074861-nsmbm-peach.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The storyline appears right now to be a pretty standard Super Mario storyline. Mario is a newcomer to the Mushroom Kingdom and must help Princess Peach defend the kingdom from Bowser.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Is there a trailer?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074862-nsmbm-toad.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo and Illumination debuted a new trailer during the November 29, 2022 Nintendo Directed devoted to the movie, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnGl01FkMMo">you can watch here</a>. Additionally, a clip of the film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-super-mario-bros-movie-clip-debuts-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509904/">debuted at the 2022 Game Awards</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Will there be more movies?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074863-oldsmbm-.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is notoriously protective of its intellectual property. After the strange, dystopian Super Mario Bros. movie was so poorly received in 1993, it took them nearly 30 years to put out another Super Mario movie. If the movie performs well with children and their parents, we imagine that Illumination will be eager to exploit the franchise to the same degree that they have the Minions characters, but Nintendo may have other plans for it depending on that reception.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

## Witcher: Blood Origin's Laurence O'Fuarain Stank Up The Room In His Prosthetic Suit

<p dir="ltr">Netflix's Christmas release of Witcher: Blood Origin will see the creation of the very first Witcher. And while characters like Geralt will eventually become beings melding magic and humanity, the first Witcher looked a bit different.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following interview has some spoilers for the finale of Witcher: Blood Origin.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Actor Laurence O'Fuarain's character Fjall is a mighty warrior, who ends up taking on that role of the very first Witcher during the final episodes of the season. However, he had to wear a large prosthetic suit for that transformation. It was tough," O'Fuarain told GameSpot. "And when you have to go into prosthetics for a couple of hours in a chair, it's never easy, but I mean, you know, part of the parcel. What would happen was I'd get collected from the apartments that I was staying in at about 2 AM, 2:15. And then I'd literally be dropped back at about 10 PM because once you get it on, you have to shoot all day, and then you have to take everything off. And like my makeup artist, Valentin, he had to be there before I was there, so I can't complain. He had it the roughest. That was just part of the job."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-blood-origins-laurence-ofuarain-stank-up-the-room-in-his-prosthetic-suit/1100-6510222/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
