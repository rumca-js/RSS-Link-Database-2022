Top of the table, with points dropped in only one of their last nine league games, they were absolutely flying when the pause button was pressed in early November. Now we wait to discover whether that momentum has survived the last six weeks. For all their quality (and the fact that the last time they lost at home on Boxing Day was so long ago that one of their centre-backs that day is now 64 (1987 and David O\u2019Leary, since you ask), a run the Hammers have twice tried and failed to end) this might not be a bad time to play them. There has only been one goalless draw between these teams since then, promisingly. West Ham started the season against Manchester City, and now have to restart it against Arsenal, which is a bit rum. I have a feeling in my bones that this game might be a good \u2019un, but then I am an incorrigible optimist.

Which is saying something, given that season one followed a girls\u2019 high school soccer team descending into cannibalistic tribes when their plane crashes in the wild.
