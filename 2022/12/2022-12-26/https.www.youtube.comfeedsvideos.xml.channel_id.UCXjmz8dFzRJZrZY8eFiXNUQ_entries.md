Conan the Barbarian is one of the biggest action movies to come out of the 80's.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance as Conan the Barbarian cemented the character as a cinematic bad ass, continuing the legacy of its literary source material.  Though as years progressed, and more Conan sequels came out, it became clear that the franchise was in a tail spin.  Finally culminating in the worst Conan the Barbarian installment starring Jason Mamoa.
