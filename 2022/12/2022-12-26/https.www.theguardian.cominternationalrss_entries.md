If you won’t… well, I’ve got the keyboard. First of all, let me tell you that it is shaping up to be a scorcher. After weeks of cold weather, the early sunlight in Melbourne today has that particular hard glint that Australian sun gets when it is preparing itself to land hammers on the anvil of the earth below. The temperature is already mid-20s and it has just gone 9am.

<p>“One Arsène Wenger” was the chant that rang around the Emirates. Sitting up in the directors’ box the old master obliged with a wave. Gabriel Martinelli had just put Arsenal in front, some of the football was reminiscent of their glory years and, on his first visit since departing emotionally in 2018, the architect of those times would have been forgiven a sense that the good old days were coming back.</p><p>Perhaps they really are. Saïd Benrahma’s first-half penalty could have blown Arsenal off course here: maybe the Premier League’s hiatus had checked them in their stride and forced a more realistic view of their title credentials. Prompted by the brilliant Martin Ødegaard, they responded through Bukayo Saka and, after Martinelli’s pivotal strike, Eddie Nketiah, to maintain the idea that their place at the summit is no mere dalliance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This was not a vintage Liverpool performance by any stretch but there were glimmers of sparkle as they dispatched Aston Villa and put their foot back on the accelerator in pursuit of the top four. Mohamed Salah got the ball rolling, equalling Kenny Dalglish’s goalscoring mark for Liverpool in almost double-quick time before Virgil van Dijk increased Liverpool’s first-half advantage. Villa deservedly replied through Ollie Watkins but a composed finish by the 18-year-old substitute Stefan Bajcetic for his first Liverpool goal left the away support rattling through their version of a Christmas classic. “Merry Christmas, Everton!” they sang as the celebrations continued.</p><p>Klopp’s festive message to supporters touched on various themes, from his admiration for Love, Actually and the “crazy world we are living in at the moment”, to Liverpool’s Champions League final defeat in May – “Mr Courtois had a pretty good day” – and, most pertinently, moving to “within punching distance” of the top four. Within 37 entertaining minutes here, they had homed in on fourth-placed Tottenham, whom they are now only five points behind with a game in hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Top of the table, with points dropped in only one of their last nine league games, they were absolutely flying when the pause button was pressed in early November. Now we wait to discover whether that momentum has survived the last six weeks. For all their quality (and the fact that the last time they lost at home on Boxing Day was so long ago that one of their centre-backs that day is now 64 (1987 and David O’Leary, since you ask), a run the Hammers have twice tried and failed to end) this might not be a bad time to play them. There has only been one goalless draw between these teams since then, promisingly. West Ham started the season against Manchester City, and now have to restart it against Arsenal, which is a bit rum. I have a feeling in my bones that this game might be a good ’un, but then I am an incorrigible optimist.

<p>Discontent was building among the home crowd inside Goodison Park even before the Wolves substitute Rayan Aït-Nouri gave Julen Lopetegui the perfect start to his reign and heightened the pressure on Frank Lampard with a 95th-minute winner against Everton. The French defender pounced in the final minute as Wolves secured a fortunate but dramatic victory that lifted them off the bottom of the Premier League.</p><p>Everton’s overly cautious approach was generating dismay among their fans when James Tarkowski launched one final, long ball towards the Wolves penalty area. It returned with punishing interest, and after Aït-Nouri scrambled home a cross from fellow substitute Adama Traoré Everton were left to reflect on another ineffective, wasteful display. It is now six defeats in eight league games for Lampard’s faltering side.

On this evidence, Newcastle should relish hosting these opponents again in a fortnight in the Carabao Cup quarter-final.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/leicester-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p></p><p>Patrick Vieira must be wondering how his side got this so wrong. Crystal Palace’s hopes of recording a fourth successive home victory in the Premier League for the first time in their history were destroyed in a three-minute spell in the first half by a clinical Fulham team led by the brilliant Aleksandar Mitrovic.</p><p>The disastrous defending that allowed Bobby DeCordova-Reid to open the scoring on 31 minutes was compounded by Tyrick Mitchell’s rush of blood to the head that earned him a straight red card and left Vieira’s side with a mountain to climb. Another red card for James Tomkins – making his first Premier League start since Boxing Day last year in absence of the suspended Marc Guehi – and further goals from Fulham’s captain Tim Ream and Mitrovic, with his tenth of the campaign, swept Marco Silva’s side to a deserved victory that leaves them level on points with Liverpool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/26/crystal-palace-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Wherever you are in Taiwan – be it three beers deep at a city bar, floating in the Taiwan Strait, or hauling yourself up a mountain – you’ll still hear the tinny, off-key classical jingle, and it will trigger a Pavlovian surge of panic: I have to take the bins out.</p><p>In the last few decades, Taiwan has transformed itself from “garbage island” to one of the world’s best managers of household trash, and it’s done so with a soundtrack.

<p>I’d do anything to get out of PE lessons at school. But now I’ve turned 30 and I need to get over my fitness-phobia</p><p>I turned 30 last month, and – naturally – spent the final stretch of my 20s thinking about all of the things I wished I’d done differently. During therapy sessions, I’d go on extended metaphors involving boats, tides and storms, which confirmed my long-held suspicion that I am definitely not a poet at heart. Amid all of the introspection, however, one theme did seem particularly pertinent: exercise, or the lack of it in my life.</p><p>Something (perhaps the slight creak my right hip now makes on a regular basis) was telling me that I needed to do more fitness, and, by “more”, of course I mean “any at all”. And so, here I am, declaring that 2023 will be the year I get over my fitness phobia, the albatross I’ve been dragging around since my very first day at primary school.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/26/new-year-resolution-start-exercising-keeping-fit">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Match switched from Twickenham to the Stoop</li><li>Bristol bottom of table while Quins can go second with victory</li></ul><p>For Harlequins and Bristol there is a sense of frustration over their festive fixtures. The match on Tuesday between the two sides ought to be taking place at Twickenham – an annual tradition for Harlequins, who tend to head into January with a spring in their step and their coffers boosted as a result. Bristol, meanwhile, were supposed to be their opponents at HQ, then hosting their own new year’s bash against Wasps next weekend.</p><p>For varying reasons – transport logistics brought on by train strikes in Harlequins’ case, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/28/wasps-suspended-from-premiership-as-rfu-confirms-relegation">Wasps’ demise</a> in Bristol’s – neither is happening as planned.

The bells and whistles that accompany Harlequins’s annual big game are absent but this fixture, which will mark the halfway point in the recalibrated season for the remaining 11 teams, has significance for both.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/26/harlequins-and-bristol-look-to-vent-festive-frustration-in-pivotal-clash">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The England striker’s goal against Germany made her a national hero and sent interest in the women’s game rocketing. But she’s not about to take her foot off the gas</p><p>When Chloe Kelly’s 2022 began, the idea that a photo of herself would capture one of the defining moments of women’s football history in England, let alone of the year, was far from her mind. Kelly was battling back from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that ended her Olympic dreams. She would make her return to the pitch in April, 11 months on from her injury, and faced a race against time to get up to speed for the Euros in July.</p><p>“It’s crazy,” the 24-year-old Manchester City forward says of the tournament. “Sometimes I look at the images and I’m like: ‘Wow, that actually happened.’ It’s an amazing memory and one that will stick with me for ever, and what it can do for the sport is just huge.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/26/chloe-kelly-euros-triumph-lioness-went-crazy-when-won">Continue reading...</a>

There is a whole generation of British people who grew up with it at Christmas and that has just carried on.”</p><p>But what if you knew that the UK coverage of the competition, which begins on Channel 5 this year on 27 December, has actually been delayed for more than six months?

<p>I know that obsessively narrating life can get in the way of living it. But my chronicling is a source of comfort </p><p>Under an awning at night with the rain coming down. On the top deck of a bus travelling between parties at opposite ends of London. Leaning against the cubicle door of a pub toilet. These are some of the places I have written Google Docs diary entries in the past week. Mostly I do so via the Google app on my phone in a document titled Written Version of 2022. It contains everything you might imagine – slipshod accounts of nights out and lists of everything I recall drinking, lines from poems and films and songs, screenshots of paintings, recipes, scraps of news, seasonally dependent paeans or fury directed towards the weather, honest accounts of my emotional state, less honest accounts of my emotional state.</p><p>At the time of writing, Written Version of 2022 is 52,000 words and 85 pages long. Sometimes I’ll augment it with new events two or three times per day. As things happen to me, I am already speculatively ordering them into a narrative, my so-called version of events becoming overlaid with their real-time unfurling. All this is to say, I’m worried my chronic diary-writing habit is starting to get in the way of me actually living my life.</p><p>Lamorna Ash is the author of Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/26/writing-a-diary-personal-freedom-life">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t just that the Faithless frontman was an imposing vocalist: his sonorous tone and steady enunciation made that a given. While the group’s first two albums, Reverence and Sunday 8PM, delivered award nominations and a parade of Top 20 singles, it was on stage where Faithless minted their reputation as an elite-level act.</p><p>Born Maxwell Fraser in 1957, Maxi Jazz – as he had become known since stints on pirate radio in the mid-1980s – was nearly 40 years old by the time Faithless formed in 1995. The practising Buddhist’s air of pacific wisdom positioned him as a spiritual counter to the spangled masses who came to bear witness as the band’s popularity soared. The energy of an entire arena would flow through Fraser, this calm eye of a rave storm. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/26/maxi-jazz-the-calm-eye-in-the-centre-of-faithlesss-rave-storm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boxing Day never looked so good with these simple yet smart ideas from our experts to use up the remains of the big day</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What interesting things can I do with my Christmas Day leftovers? <br /></strong><em><strong>Chloe, Margate<br /></strong></em>Sure, Christmas dinner is great, but leftovers can be even better. Yesterday’s meat and veg encased in pastry for a pie, for example,<strong> </strong>or a turnover is a winner come Boxing Day, says Lisa Goodwin-Allen, executive chef of <a href="https://www.northcote.com/">Northcote</a> in Lancashire and <a href="https://thestaffordlondon.com/the-game-bird/">The Game Bird at The Stafford</a> in London. “They’re super-simple and can be made from everything left in your fridge.” She melts 20g butter, adds a diced onion and 100g sprouts, and cooks until soft. “Add crushed garlic, 60ml cream, season and cook for four minutes, then add a handful of diced turkey and ham.” Spoon on to squares of rolled puff pastry and fold, “pinching<strong> </strong>the sides to ensure you don’t have any air pockets. Slash with a knife and bake at 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8 for five to seven minutes, until golden.”</p><p>Alternatively, keep turkey day going with a risotto, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-siadatan">Tim Siadatan</a> of <a href="https://www.trullorestaurant.com/">Trullo</a> and <a href="https://www.padella.co/">Padella</a>, both in London, says: “Make it like you normally would, then at the end go in with chopped cooked turkey, a decent whack of butter and parmesan.” Get it on a plate, top with sliced raw sprouts (“for crunch”) and crumbs of stilton, and finish with good olive oil. Turkey – plus pigs in blankets, stuffing, and chestnuts – would also be at home in ravioli. “There’s lots going on here,” Siadatan says, “but it’s worth it.” Chop your filling ingredients, then enclose mounds of the stuff between sheets of pasta, stamp out your parcels and cook. Sauce-wise, Siadatan recommends “a nice, bitter Italian leaf” such as radicchio, which he roasts, chops and adds, along with butter, to gravy that has been reduced.

Free to use, intuitive, immediate and, when it comes to group chats with friends, collective fun. A brief scan of my recent chats reveals a copious amount of memes, a photo of my friend’s new six-pack, a rant about someone on telly, an exchange of photos of cold sores, a pet video, a podcast recommendation and yet another attempt to arrange a get-together.

## ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ says the US campaign slogan. Starmer would do well to learn it | Anne McElvoy

<p>The Labour leader must be clear about how he’ll succeed where Tories have failed – rehashing Blair’s strategies isn’t enough</p><p></p><p>The future direction of UK plc now looks more likely to come from the Starmer and Reeves emporium than the woeful management of the present Are You Being (Under) Served?<em> </em>government. In the mayhem of 2022, the Tories forfeited their claim to be the natural managers of the UK economy. Opportunity knocks for the opposition to fill that gap.</p><p>Attacking the government’s record here is straightforward: the economy has had skimpy growth for most of its 12 years in power (<a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/12/15/britains-economic-record-since-2007-ranks-near-the-bottom-among-peer-countries">on a per-person basis, the economy has grown just 7% </a>in real terms since the financial crash of 2007-08). Perhaps more concerning for any potential replacement, productivity has lagged behind competitors. Voters feel the result in their real-terms household incomes, and lower earners now find basics, let alone treats, less affordable. So “the Tories tanked the economy” is a line with a lot of truth to it. Planning to get the economy upright again is a more daunting task. That will need to change in 2023 as voters will want to know more about Labour’s intended direction of travel.</p><p>Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/26/economy-keir-starmer-labour-tories-blair">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a beach comedy movie to people-free abstract art, our critics offer cultural escapes for those who’ve already had enough festive spirit</p><p>There is plenty of cheer in the unapologetically silly, raunchy comedy Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, but none of it particularly festive. It’s written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig – the team behind hit 2011 film Bridesmaids – and the two comedians also star as small-town Nebraskans having a rollicking good time on their first ever vacation. The fictional Florida town of Vista Del Mar is saturated in beachy summery hues, the hotel pool is an exquisite aquamarine blue, and talking crabs and mermaids feature. Yet in this cheerful idyll, danger brews in the form of a sun-avoiding supervillain plotting revenge on the forever-tanned Floridians. Jamie Dornan, playing the Hawaiian shirt-loving henchman, is a particular delight. <em>Rebecca Liu</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/26/christmas-cultural-escapes">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m extremely interested in deviant behaviour’: Christina Ricci on cannibalism, chaos and childcare

<p>With roles in hit cannibal horror Yellowjackets and a TV reboot for the Addams Family character that made her name, the actor has had an amazing year – even if she has plenty of regrets …</p><p>When I was a teenager and first going to gigs, I was told an unwritten rule: never wear the T-shirt of the act you’re going to see. So, I thought long and hard about whether to wear my T-shirt of Christina Ricci (as Wednesday Addams) to my interview with Christina Ricci. We’re due to discuss her far more recent role as Misty Quigley in the macabre survival drama Yellowjackets, when the T-shirt question is taken out of my hands: her publicists insist our video call be voices only. But as I soon learn, Ricci is not someone with whom rules hold much sway. “Rules” suggests definiteness, yet defying other people’s definitions has been her lifelong career, and even in our interview – as I press my questions, trying to get a sense of her – she eludes it. “I love chaos,” she muses at one point. Yep, I should have worn the T-shirt.</p><p>When we connect, Ricci, 42, is in the middle of shooting season two of Yellowjackets, which this time around sees Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings) and Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) join the cast. “Reading the first two scripts, I was shocked,” she says. Which is saying something, given that season one followed a girls’ high school soccer team descending into cannibalistic tribes when their plane crashes in the wild. Ricci plays the adult Misty – a quiet, unpopular kid who finds that the wilderness gives her the social cache she always dreamed of. “So many people will say to me, ‘I am Misty,’” says Ricci. “It’s interesting that people relate to such an extreme character, and that feeling of not being accepted, of feeling alone.” Ricci was instantly intrigued by her. “I’m extremely interested in deviant behaviour,” she says, “and what happens to someone when they feel very small – the pettiness, the control – especially in terms of how it relates to women’s experience.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/26/im-extremely-interested-in-deviant-behaviour-christina-ricci-on-cannibalism-chaos-and-childcare">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Dead Oceans)<br /></strong>Morby’s seventh album was inspired by sickness and mortality but his elegiac songs focus on life’s transience and joys</p><p>The story of <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kevin-morby-this-is-a-photograph/">Kevin Morby’s superb seventh album</a> begins in January 2020. After his father collapsed at dinner one night and was rushed to hospital, the Kansas-based singer-songwriter found himself leafing through old family photos of his dad in his youthful prime. The older man was in recovery by the time his son moved into the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kevin-morby-this-is-a-photograph-album-video-1315720/">Peabody Hotel in Memphis</a>, Tennessee to pour out songs about mortality, family and the relentlessness of time.</p><p>Morby maps all this out in the first track of This Is a Photograph: “This is a photograph, a window to the past,” he begins, concluding: “This is what I’ll miss about being alive.” The album’s Dylanesque take on Americana is teased with blues, jazz, deep soul and Afrobeat, and sprinkled with field recordings ranging from children playing to birdsong. References abound: Morby includes snatches of Led Zeppelin and John Lennon lyrics and alludes to Jeff Buckley’s drowning in the Mississippi River, obliquely on Disappearing and directly on A Coat of Butterflies. Morby is such an exemplary songwriter that everything hangs together wonderfully.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/26/kevin-morby-this-is-a-photograph-review-exemplary-songwriter-wrings-light-from-darkness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was 20, living in St Petersburg and desperately in need of a warm coat. But as I saw the gift, my face turned ashen</p><p>In December 1993, I was living in St Petersburg as part of the year abroad for my university course in Russian. This was in the heady days of glasnost, perestroika and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/putin-war-mcdonalds-russia-i-remember">newly opened branches of McDonald’s</a> where you met Russians who burst into tears of disbelief when they realised you were from “<em>tam</em>” (over there).</p><p>It was the innocent time of trading Levi’s and hard currency in the street. People would ask endless earnest questions about the Beatles, Deep Purple and King Crimson. With the strains of the Scorpions’ Winds of Change ringing in our ears (“Let your balalaika sing / What my guitar wants to say”), it was completely normal to assume that Russia was on its way to becoming a beacon of democracy and freedom like any other responsible independent eastern European state, just a rather large one. How times change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/26/i-had-to-turn-down-a-coat-with-dead-fox-draped-over-it-the-christmas-present-ill-never-forget">Continue reading...</a>

But their recent success drives home just how much the dark days of this franchise are over. It’s kind of a miracle, really. To excel in the present, one must learn from the past.

Around them on stage are men’s boots, belts and a hat. The men are no longer here but killed in war.</p><p>It’s what writer and director Susan Moffat calls “the presence of absence”. In the play My Thousand Year Old Land (A Song for BiH), which Moffat wrote alongside Bosnian war survivor Aida Haughton, we follow three women whose lives are changed by the deaths of their communities’ men in the 1990s conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They find themselves taking on the typically male roles in the family, from tilling the fields to feeding cockerels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/26/bosnian-war-stories-stage-my-thousand-year-old-land-susan-moffat-aida-haughton">Continue reading...</a>

Then it all started to go awry. First, a trunk appeared in the reporter’s left ear, then on his head, then attached itself to his nose, mistaking it, perhaps, for a spot of lunch.

<p>From funk to pop to country, Guardian writers pick their favourite songs of the year that seem to have passed most listeners by</p><p>Picture the scene: you’re floating around your Frank Lloyd Wright bungalow a little lovelorn, but not so lovelorn that you can’t shuffle out a little two-step to the stereo and make yourself a cocktail. Here’s the world suggested by the bone-dry funk of Holy Hell, the lead single from the second album by Eddie Chacon. You might know him as one half of 90s duo Charles and Eddie (of Would I Lie to You? fame). After the band split in 1997 and Charles Pettigrew died in 2001, Chacon entered a wilderness period, wrestling with his ego and motivation for making music before stopping altogether. After meeting pianist and producer John Carroll Kirby (Solange, Blood Orange, Harry Styles), Chacon made the remarkable comeback album Pleasure, Joy and Happiness in 2020. Next year sees an equally fantastic follow-up, heralded by a song so addictive it put the rest of my Spotify Unwrapped in the shade. The sublime drums snap like turtles, the synths bubble as languidly as lava lamp orbs; Chacon’s ghostly croon rises to a brushed-velvet falsetto, just ready to go up in flames as he entreats a lover to choose between pleasure and pain. <em>Laura Snapes</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/25/the-best-songs-of-2022-you-may-not-have-heard">Continue reading...</a>

My earliest memories of Saturday afternoons are of crackling football commentary on a transistor radio, as his tea cooled in a 70s brown and orange mug – a familiar place of safety and happiness. Like our shared big noses, my support for West Ham wasn’t something I could really choose of my own free will.</p><p>As a teenager I was still listening to matches on the radio while I did my homework, but gradually the emotional pull of football waned. The son of one of mum’s best friends, who was the same age as me, was murdered in an incident connected to Scottish football sectarianism. I rolled my eyes at the naff jingoism surrounding the 1996 European Championships. Above all, the sport seemed at odds with my growing confusion about my sexuality. During the 1990s, it was a pillar of the homophobic lad culture that I encountered at school, in the media, on the stands when dad and I went to Upton Park, and in the brutal treatment of the gay footballer Justin Fashanu, who died by suicide in 1998.

<p>From leadership training with horses to learning emotional growth with pigs, the self-improvement industry is coolly scrutinised in this enigmatic documentary</p><p>Menna Laura Meijer’s documentary is an intriguing, if distinctly refrigerated, look at the various ways in which people in the Netherlands are coached in personal growth and mindfulness. The movie is a series of tableaux, with the various study sessions and encounter groups shot from a distance in a fixed camera position, very rarely cutting to a closeup. The movie washes every scene with an invigoratingly cold, clear light and there is an elegant visual and compositional sense in every frame.</p><p>We see quarterlife crisis coaching and leadership training with horses; people learn emotional focus and centredness by lying down in a barnyard stroking some very clean-looking pigs. Cops learn not to react to provocation through role-playing. People learn how to take ownership of their emotions so their emotions do not take ownership of them. There is tree climbing to overcome fear and some (eminently sensible) tutoring in fall prevention for senior citizens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/26/now-something-is-slowly-changing-review-a-cold-hard-look-at-personal-growth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sculptor Cullen, 52, proposed to chef Kerridge, 49, six weeks after they met at a bar. They have now been married for 22 years and have a young son</p><p>The night Tom Kerridge met his future wife, Beth, he had just finished his shift as a chef in Covent Garden, London, and he wanted to go home – but it was his friend’s birthday and his flatmate dragged him out. “We went into Camden, walked into a bar and there was this loud northern woman,” says Tom with a laugh. “She went: ‘You’re Tom. Give me £3 for the stripper.’” (To be fair, this was 1997, when it was still considered ironic to get a stripper for a friend’s birthday.) “That was the first sentence Beth said to me.”</p><p>Beth Cullen, <a href="https://bethcullensculpture.co.uk/">a sculptor</a>, worked with Tom’s best friend’s brother as an assistant for the artist Sir Anthony Caro. That night, she says, they “talked for ages, and somebody actually said: ‘How long have you been going out?’ We were like: ‘We’ve just met!’ We just hit it off.” What did they talk about? “I have to be honest, it was 25 years ago and I was quite a big drinker then, so I have absolutely no idea,” says Tom. But obvious flirtation? “It was like it was already there,” says Beth. “We were flirty, but it was already a done deal.” Tom adds: “It was like we’d known each other for ages.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/26/how-tom-kerridge-met-beth-cullen-her-first-words-to-me-were-give-me-3-for-the-stripper">Continue reading...</a>
