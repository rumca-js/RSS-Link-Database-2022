  <p id="ijXBF8">Oh no, it’s almost January 1st and you forgot to make a resolution! This doesn’t have to be hard. Like, I mean, if you <em>want</em> to do your first marathon, knock yourself out. But I’ve found simpler is better for resolutions. You might consider tending to yourself as though you are a garden: you don’t need to be bulldozed and totally revamped every year, just revitalized a little to let yourself bloom.</p>
<p id="aNNcGW">You don’t even have to struggle to come up with something — because I have some suggestions right here:</p>
<ul>
<li id="vRxM6X">
<strong>Get up to pee immediately at night</strong>. I’m pretty sure I got this one from <a href="https://nicole.substack.com/">the writer Nicole Cliffe</a>, and it’s really good. I know it’s nice and warm in bed and it’s cold outside of bed, especially if you are camping and in a sleeping bag, but…...</li>

  <p id="s4Deqy">Whenever I see news about deep brain stimulation, I perk up. The procedure — which involves implanting electrodes deep into the brain to deliver regular pulses of electricity — is used to treat people like my mom with movement disorders like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/13/23166060/apple-watch-parkinsons-rune-labs-fda">Parkinson’s disease</a> or epilepsy. Researchers are also exploring whether it can be used to treat depression, but results on that front have been decidedly mixed. </p>
<p id="E9HWj1">That’s one reason that this<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/14/1064906/mood-decoder-measure-depression/"> story published by <em>MIT Technology Review</em></a> caught my eye. Neuroscientists have discovered a “mood decoder” — a way to measure a person’s moods by simply looking at their brain activity for the first time — that could improve deep brain stimulation for depression. The research was recently presented at the Society...</p>

  <p id="Bm0doX">In my favorite TikTok video of 2022, an amateur interviewer with a tiny microphone approaches a stranger in an AC/DC T-shirt minding their own business. Pushing the mic in front of the person’s face, the interviewer comes in with the favorite question of gatekeepers from time immemorial:</p>
<p id="a7Qqpq">“Can you name three AC/DC songs?” </p>
<p id="xtXsyd">Wordlessly, without hesitation, the person in the AC/DC shirt glances down at the mic, back up at the interviewer, and swats away his hand, like how you’d shoo away a fly near your food. It is beautiful, amazing, perfect, and, if we’re all so lucky, will hopefully become <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRqFKudf/">way more normalized</a> in the future.</p>

  <p id="oTsZVa">2022 may have been a slow year for big AAA video game releases, but it was a great year for the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo itself released a bunch of excellent games (including <em>two</em> great <em>Pokémon</em> titles), third-party developers ported some phenomenal RPGs, and indies launched some of my sleeper hits of the year. </p>
<p id="p95rpY">Yes, it’s a bummer that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/13/23350972/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-sequel-breath-of-the-wild-2-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001375/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-2-sequel-delay-release-date">was delayed</a> to May 2023.

<p id="6RRwhy">The problem is, there isn’t a single app that can handle the majority of my needs. By my count, there are at least 10 productivity apps I use on a daily basis to function — and they all suck. </p>

  <p class="p-large-text" id="453lBJ">When I think of bad video game dialogue, I’m reminded of <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAtomicTwins/status/1271172203287994371">this tweet</a>: the thinly veiled exposition, the personality quirks as a stand-in for actual characterization, the stilted and strangely paced delivery. Basically, this is the way no person speaks or has ever spoken.</p>
<p id="pvPOim">And yet, in most video games, this is how every character comes across, like an alien figuring out how to sound like a human in real time. It’s so pervasive that you learn to live with it — or you press X to skip ahead.</p>
<p id="GFaix4">But what gets me are the games where the bad writing is completely unnecessary. This year, I’m thinking of a couple of games specifically: two where I loved actually playing them, until the moments where they forced me to sit and listen to atrocious...</p>

After years of go-go growth, podcast hits going mainstream, major corporate investment, and hype about the market to come ($4 billion by 2024!!), optimism about the industry hit the wall of an uncertain economy.

This means Paramount Plus can entertain a wide variety of tastes, from wine moms to football uncles and every jaded Millennial, Xennial, and Gen Z teen in between.
