In it, we learned the bird app censored information that was true but went against the narrative, discredited doctors, and blocked people who shared data from the CDC.  Everything we knew was happening, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-all-in-podcast" target="_blank">but now with proof</a>.</p><p>There is a lot to dig through and dig through it we shall. But there was one exchange that I believe says so, so much about Big Tech companies during the pandemic and the types of people who work there.</p><p>Remember when Donald Trump <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-walter-reed-covid" target="_blank">got SCHMOVID</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-trump-cnn-hypocrisy" target="_blank">kicked SCHMOVID'S</a> ass to the dismay of the media? Disgraced Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/davidzweig/status/1607378386338340867" target="_blank">lawyer Jim Baker wanted</a> Trump's tweet removed for "misinformation." It was the following tweet.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!<br />— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>What part of the tweet was deemed by Baker to be misinformation? The one that didn't demand Americans' lives in fear. "Don't be afraid of SCHMOVID."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">34. In a surreal exchange, Jim Baker, at the time Twitter’s Deputy General Counsel, asks why telling people to not be afraid wasn’t a violation of Twitter’s Covid-19 misinformation policy. <a href="https://t.co/SxvOKcvaT7">pic.twitter.com/SxvOKcvaT7</a><br />— David Zweig (@davidzweig) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidzweig/status/1607390165370109953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This event went too far for Yoel Roth, and YOU KNOW he hated having to take Trump's side. He explained slowly to Baker that saying we shouldn't live in fear isn't "misinformation" as much as "an opinion" and "positivity." Those things didn't become no-no's at the bird app until Joe Biden came calling.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">35. Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of Trust & Safety, had to explain that optimism wasn’t misinformation. <a href="https://t.co/1pj8uvzWR1">pic.twitter.com/1pj8uvzWR1</a><br />— David Zweig (@davidzweig) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidzweig/status/1607390483696979968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>They wanted you to live in fear. And once they got a president who was down with the plan, it's all they did. Never forget this.</p><p><p>

## Stephen A. Smith warns his fellow liberals 'be careful what you wish for' if this guy is the GOP nominee

Smith has some time on his hands. His favorite pastime <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stephen-a-smith-laughs-cowboys" target="_blank">of sh*ting on Dallas Cowboys fans</a> is hard to do when the team is 11-3. So my man has started podcasting and decided to dip his toe in the GOP presidential race. Smith <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jerry-jones-photo-stephen-a" target="_blank">can be hit</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-tebow-stephen-smith-jaguars" target="_blank">miss when he enters</a> our world, but this was more of a warning to his "fellow" liberals. Be careful when you wish for with America's Governor Ron DeSantis as the Republican presidential contest.</p><p>Smith said a lit of <a href="https://redstate.com/mike_miller/2022/12/25/watch-stephen-a-smith-warns-left-wingers-desantis-isnt-trump-be-careful-what-you-wish-for-n679013" target="_blank">what we hear on the regular</a>. DeSantis is Trump wearing big boy pants and without Trump's many personality deficits. But I think Stephen A. misses the point here.</p><blockquote>They’re viewing him as the grown-up version of Donald Trump. And because of that reality, when he runs, because I believe he will, he’s not the easy target Trump is. You wanted Trump gone, not just because of his behavior, his perpetual lies, and all of this other stuff. <strong>You wanted him gone because of the policies.</strong> You wanted him gone because of how he reshaped the courts! You don’t get to do that with DeSantis. </blockquote><p>Right. OR, maybe they didn't want Trump gone over his policies. His policies were popular. Right-wing policies have always been popular. Trump's behavior and acting like a manbaby is what turned off moderate and independent voters in the suburbs. It wasn't the lower taxes, the robust job creation, or having a border that was secure during his presidency.</p><p>DeSantis? Look no further than a poll that came out <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/desantis-education-message-winning-battleground-states-teacher-union-p-rcna38232" target="_blank"><strong>FUNDED BY THE TEACHERS' UNIONS</strong></a> showing Americans agreed with DeSantis and not with progressives or corporate media. When activist organizations put polls like this in the field, it's to have "data" to attack their opponents. The teachers' union couldn't even do that right.</p><p>We're going to have a robust debate in 2023 over who's going to be our presidential candidate. If I were to guess, things will start to get really silly around CPAC. But if I was Stephen A.'s fellow liberal brethren, claiming DeSantis's policies are unpopular may help you sleep at night. Though you might want to pay closer attention. Last time voters didn't, we got stuck with Biden.</p><p><p>

You are trying to provide for your family. People are stealing because why work hard when you can simply take stuff?  This store owner came across one criminal too many. He and a coworker locked the door until the woman either paid for what she was attempting to steal or put it back.</p><p>"Locked the door" might be the wrong word.

<p>Like clockwork, a new Twitter Files dropped on Christmas Eve. There was much of what we always knew was true about the feds and the government working with Twitter.
