The efforts focused on members of think tanks and academics, dating back to April. The attacks began with spear phishing emails, often claiming to be from figures in South Koreas political system. These usually included either links to fake sites or viruses as attachments. The ploy, while not particularly sophisticated, was enough to fool at least a handful of victims.</p><p>The result was that several prominent experts had their personal data stolen, email lists compromised (exposing more people to the hackers), and 13 companies (primarily online retailers) were victims of ransomware. Although police believe only 49 recipients actually handed credentials over to the fakes sites and only two companies paid the 2.5 million won ($1,980) ransom, it's difficult to judge the full scale of the fallout.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It's unclear what non-financial resources the North Korean hackers may have gained from this latest campaign. But it's certain this will not be the last cyber attack on its souther neighbor. The county has previously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-north-korean-campaign-security-researchers-060603985.html\">targeted security researchers</a> to discover unpatched vulnerabilities, and even used the tragedy on Halloween in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/north-korean-hackers-target-south-koreans-following-itaewon-halloween-tragedy-185159350.html\">Itaewon</a> as a tool to target South Korean citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber warfare has been a major focus of North Korea for years, even as it seeks to deter foreign militaries with more traditional methods, like building nuclear weapons. It has also been a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fbi-believes-north-korean-hacker-cell-behind-600-million-crypto-heist-190210513.html\">major source of revenue</a> for the country which is in perpetual financial crisis and largely cut off from the world's markets. It's estimated that North Korean hackers have stolen $1.72 billion worth of cryptocurrency since 2017. And it doesn't appear that it's letting the recent crypto crash scare it off, as the recent ransoms were also paid in BitCoin.</p><p>Though the hackers covered their tracks reasonably well, the targets, tactics and IP addresses have led police to believe this is the same group that hacked the Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power in 2014. They also believe that the hackers will not cease their activity just because their efforts have been discovered. Authorities have urged people, especially those who work in sensitive areas like technology and government, to step up their security measures and be extra vigilant against fishing and human engineering attacks.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/uplift-standing-desk-irl-163028001.html?src=rss", "title": "What we bought: The standing desk I chose after researching the hell out of the competition", "date_published": "2022-12-26 16:30:28+00:00", "description": "<p>When I started working from home five years ago, my chair was the floor and my desk was a stool.

Back when I ordered, the offerings from Uplift felt the most comprehensive, with a slew of size, color and desktop material customization options, and they had the most accessories.</p><p>That\u2019s something you\u2019ll notice as you configure your desk: there are a huge number of add-ons available. Probably the most unexpected is the <a href=\"https://www.upliftdesk.com/under-desk-hammock-by-uplift-desk/\">under-desk hammock</a>, but that\u2019s only available for desks 72 inches wide and larger, so I didn't get one. Plus I own a couch. Mine came with two free accessories when I purchased it a couple years ago, but lucky buyers today get six freebies. I went for the free rocker board, which I don\u2019t use, and now wish I\u2019d grabbed the cushioned standing mat instead. I also picked the bamboo under-desk drawer, which I use daily, filled with a few of these <a href=\"https://threebythree.com/products/stacking-bin-sets-of-5\">metal storage bins</a>.</p><p>If you browse through the image galleries on Uplift\u2019s site you\u2019ll notice idealized office setups, with a curious lack of cables on, under or snaking away from the desks, as if buying one will somehow make <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/tesla-s-vision-of-wireless-energy-nikola-tesla-museum/FQXRHCCNJKDMJg?hl=en\">wireless energy transmission</a> a reality. Turns out that\u2019s not the case, but Uplift does offer a number of ways to route and hide those still-necessary cords. Every desk comes with a wire management tray that mounts at the rear underside of the desk, along with cable tie mounts to keep wires up and out of the way. I paid $35 extra for the <a href=\"https://www.upliftdesk.com/magnetic-cable-organizing-channel-by-uplift-desk/\">magnetic cable channel</a> which keeps the rather thick cable that powers the desk routed against the desk leg.</p><figure><img alt=\"Uplift Desk IRL\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/e1413930-773a-11ed-b78e-5b116d4e47e9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Once the desk arrived, it was fairly easy to assemble following the <a href=\"https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-desk-assembly-programming/\">video instructions</a>. What stood out to me most about my new office furniture was the weight. It\u2019s <em>heavy</em>. Each leg contains three nesting sections of steel with a steel crossbar up top. I\u2019m sure my bamboo desktop is among the lighter of Uplift\u2019s options, but it\u2019s still substantial. Considering how little anything wobbles as it raises and lowers, or when it\u2019s 45 inches off the ground, I think the heft is a good thing.</p><p>After the desk was assembled, it took a little fussing to get the cables hidden in a way that somewhat resembled the minimalism you see in the Uplift gallery photos. It helps to lift the desk to its full height when you\u2019re setting up so you can get under there to work with the plugs, power strips and cable ties \u2013 something I wish I\u2019d realized before I spent an hour hunched under there while it was at normal-desk height.</p><figure><img alt=\"Uplift Desk IRL\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/1da0b2c0-773b-11ed-b7fc-917a55338303\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Lifting and lowering the desk is a simple push-button operation. The standard (aka free) keypad only has up and down buttons, which you press and hold to adjust the desk\u2019s height. Uplift \u201crecommends\u201d paying the extra $40 for an advanced keypad that lets you program four different height settings; I gave in to the upsell, but I\u2019m glad I did. If you need to go from sitting to standing or the other way around, just push a numbered key and the desk adjusts all by itself. I only use two pre-programmed positions \u2013 a sit and a stand height \u2013 but it\u2019s nice to have the option of more settings. For example, if I ever want to make use of that balance board, I might need a couple extra inches.</p><p>The operation is impressively smooth and almost silent. During working hours, my cat stations himself at the corner of my desk and doesn\u2019t wake from a nap when I change heights. I adjust the desk four times a day, starting off standing, switching to sitting for lunch and staying seated for an hour or two after. When I start to feel that afternoon slump, I\u2019ll raise the desk back up to standing, which (paired with a cup of tea) usually helps with focus. Then just before quitting time, I sit down for the last hour or so, pushing the standing button when I log off so it\u2019s ready for tomorrow. I\u2019ve been more or less following that pattern for two years and the motors are performing exactly as they did when I first got the desk. Aside from a little dulling in the desktop finish where I have my mouse, everything still feels and looks new.</p><p>You\u2019ve probably heard it said that your healthiest working position is your next one, meaning you shouldn\u2019t stay in any posture for long. Having an adjustable desk doesn\u2019t necessarily solve the problem of bad ergonomics \u2013 standing still all day is nearly as bad as sitting \u2013 but I\u2019ve found when I\u2019m standing, I\u2019m much more apt to step away and get in a stretch, or even pace a bit when I\u2019m searching for my next word. The Uplift desk is worlds away from a stool on the floor, and I don\u2019t think I could ever go back to just a regular desk again.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-games-2022-150020578.html?src=rss", "title": "Engadget\u2019s favorite games of 2022", "date_published": "2022-12-26 15:00:20+00:00", "description": "<p>What a year for gaming.

It indulges in absurdity without disrupting the rapid-fire combat or Bayonetta\u2019s unrivaled sense of fashion and wit. <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is joyful, mechanically rich and full of action, plus it allows players to transform into a literal hell train in order to take down massive beasts bent on destroying the multiverse. Bayonetta elegantly dances her way through battles, dropping one-liners and shooting enemies with her gun shoes in one moment, and turning into a giant spider creature the next.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Bayonetta series just keeps getting weirder, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s losing its sense of satisfying gameplay along the way. In the franchise\u2019s third installment, Bayonetta is powerful, confident and funny; she\u2019s a drag queen in a universe loosely held together by witchcraft, and the chaos of this combination is truly magical. <em>\u2013 Jessica Conditt, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.cultofthelamb.com/\">Cult of the Lamb</a></h2><div id=\"1f0d0d693c4843ac9561e4803d5072ef\"></div><p>Sure, you\u2019ve played <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Hades</em> and <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> \u2013 but what if you could play all of them at once, in a single adorable demonic package? That\u2019s <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, baby.</p><p><em>Cult of the Lamb</em> is part social and farming simulator, part dungeon-crawling roguelike and all-around fantastic. After being sacrificed and resurrected, you\u2019re instructed by a grand, dark deity to start your own cult, managing worship services, agriculture, cooking, marriages, deaths and much more. You must also venture into the wilderness to battle demons and recruit more followers. Keep in mind that you\u2019re a lamb, which makes all of this exceptionally cute.</p><p><em>Cult of the Lamb</em> is a brilliant balance of satanic dungeon crawling and cult simulation, offering more action than <em>Animal Crossing</em> and more casual farming mechanics than <em>Hades</em>. <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> is incredibly satisfying, and it\u2019s rich in gameplay, story and environments.

I love that stuff! But <em>Elden Ring</em> tried something new, effectively playing a shell game with those four player states, and making discovery the new initial draw.</p><p>My big \"aha!\" moments in <em>Dark Souls 3</em> or <em>Bloodborne</em> arrived when I'd finally spotted a shortcut or sussed out a boss's hidden weakness. <em>Elden Ring</em> retained that. But what really made the good brain chemicals flow was just\u2026 roaming around. Reaching the top of some lava-ridden mesa. Or finding a way onto some seemingly inaccessible islet. The grandeur of the settings and knowledge FromSoft wouldn't make me work for a slice of geography devoid of treasures to loot and dudes to hack apart made the effort worthwhile.</p><p>Some fans adore the limited palate of <em>Sekiro</em> which essentially tells players, \"git gud or quit.\" Call me a bad gamer (accurate) but I prefer the maximalism and flexibility that <em>Elden Ring</em> brought to the table. Want to grind until every boss is trivial? How about a hitless all-remembrances run? Either, and anything in between, is valid. Allowing for challenge <em>and</em> accessibility makes <em>Elden Ring</em> a beautifully executed twist on the formula FromSoft has been honing for nearly 30 years. <em>\u2013 Avery Menegus, Senior News Editor</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://bethesda.net/en/game/ghostwire-tokyo\">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a></h2><div id=\"be133babcb2445ba91da003e87673d4e\"></div><p>Sometimes, games you were once really <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ghostwire-tokyo-preview-ps5-2022-150024173.html\">looking forward</a> to playing just sneak past you at launch. That\u2019s totally true of <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, a game from Tango Gameworks, which also created the underrated horror game <em>The Evil Within</em> and its sequel.</p><p><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em>is different to those, though. It\u2019s often\u2026 funny. Sure, there are grotesque Japanese folklore monsters and creepy faceless men-in-suits to hurl magic at, but there are also ghosts trapped in toilet cubicles that need a few extra rolls of toilet paper, or park trees that need to be magically cleansed for nearby spirits to feel at ease. You play through a first-person perspective, using elemental attacks, charms and a spiritual bow and arrow set to take down an array of spirits that have invaded a substantial patch of central Tokyo. If you\u2019ve heard the game described as <em>Yakuza, </em>but with ghosts, well, it\u2019s a completely different kind of game. But the beautifully rendered buildings, interiors and streets definitely hit similar notes. Due to a supernatural attack on the city, you won\u2019t bump into any other humans, pretty much through the entire campaign, which adds an eerie air to the entire game. It\u2019s either ghouls trying to kill you, or spirits that need your help to move on.</p><p>The main game is short but punchy enough. It feels like a game that was banking on DLC to round out a lot of the more ambiguous plot questions players might have, but it\u2019s uncertain whether that will ever happen. It\u2019s still a fun supernatural game that takes a different approach to horror, with some mind-bending set pieces that bring some of the more imaginative parts of games like <em>Control</em> into the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. And who doesn\u2019t want to be stalked by hundreds of paper eyeballs? <em>\u2013 Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tY2EvZ2FtZXMvZ29kLW9mLXdhci1yYWduYXJvay8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc0Mzg2MmRkLWM3YmYtNGQ5Mi1iNDM0LTRlMDE4NzE5NDJlZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX4PoeNAKM_iYQygWOGR-XqJ6UhhUtHftqmwje6tOMvl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgames%2Fgod-of-war-ragnarok%2F\">God of War: Ragnarok</a></h2><div id=\"6fd3e2fa4afe475baf76510a8abc6c24\"></div><p>When I was first introduced to Kratos, the God of War, he was on my PS2, taking a stroll along a Cretan wharf, casually tearing a few Minotaurs in half. Things only went downhill from there. For a full three mythos-crushing game installments, things only went downhill from there. I mean, by the end of <em>GoW III</em> you had to dig pretty far down the Pantheon talent list to find a surviving deity.</p><p>But when we were reintroduced to Kratos on the PS4, we were not given back the pale ball of vengeful fury and barely-contained ultraviolence that we had grown to know and love. This new one was, well, not softer but at least not quite so hard-edged as before. This was a Kratos with bad knees who old-man grunted when he stood; a Kratos with a son he struggled to connect with but still reared in a dangerous and unforgiving world, demi-god or not. This was a more relatable Kratos, one that had aged alongside the gamers that inhabit his form in the intervening console years, with concerns and motivation beyond most efficiently chain slashing his way through enemy hordes.</p><p>I think a big part of what made <em>God of War</em> the Game of the Year in 2018 was that progression away from thinly-veiled plot points serving as excuses for more blood, boobs and button smashing; and towards a more mature, measured examination, not just of Kratos\u2019 relationship with Atreus, but the larger theme of how to process familial loss, its accompanying grief, and to move forward from the pain.</p><p><em>Ragnarok</em> is both an affirmation of Kratos\u2019 reformation and a lodestar for the future of the God of War franchise. I\u2019m not going to spoil the rich and nuanced multi-arc-with-just-a-hint-of-time-travel storyline for those who have not yet played but it, in my opinion at least, is the best written of the series. This is a game with cutscenes you\u2019ll want to sit through. Combine that with well-paced skill-adjustable action, huge maps packed with treasures and secrets, an expansive supporting cast and star-studded voice acting \u2013 not to mention a menagerie-worth of mystical wildlife just begging to be torn limb from limb \u2013 and you\u2019ve got yourself one of the best games of 2022. <em>\u2014 Andrew Tarantola, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tY2EvZ2FtZXMvaG9yaXpvbi1mb3JiaWRkZW4td2VzdC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc0Mzg2MmRkLWM3YmYtNGQ5Mi1iNDM0LTRlMDE4NzE5NDJlZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAU4Do2eKmpVDrpNg_2vjhyZ8R34cXnDTjH3wEUEbA7Oo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgames%2Fhorizon-forbidden-west%2F\">Horizon Forbidden West</a></h2><div id=\"d28468b9c7d54305b8f16abc30403625\"></div><p>Sony\u2019s first-party studios have generally done <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-070140792.html\">sequels</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html\">right</a>, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html\">is no exception</a>. The first game had one of my favorite narratives, as protagonist Aloy learned what happened a thousand years prior to bring about the mysterious world she (and the player) inhabit \u2013 one where mankind lives in relatively primitive tribes trying to stay safe from giant animal-like machines run amok.</p><p><em>Forbidden West</em> delivers even more of what worked in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn. </em>Aloy remains a steadfast, righteous and occasionally stubborn protagonist who continues to grow as she uncovers more secrets about the world around her while fighting a totally unexpected force bent on destroying Earth as she knows it. The twists of <em>Forbidden West </em>don\u2019t <em>quite</em> match the first game\u2019s reveal of how the world we know evolved into the world Aloy inhabits. But the narrative is still rich and complex, and the new parts of what was once the American southwest that you get to explore are rendered in stunning detail. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful games I\u2019ve ever played.</p><p>As with any good sequel, combat and traversal around the world have been refined \u2013 there are more weapons than ever, and you can customize them to match your play style or the particular enemies you\u2019re facing. Melee combat against humans and machines alike has also been significantly upgraded, and new items like a grappling hook and hang glider make getting around quicker and more fun. And nearly all the machines from the first game return, along with some colossal new enemies that present a massive challenge, but also a massive bit of satisfaction as you figure out their weak spots and systematically take them down.</p><p>I think my favorite new thing of <em>Forbidden West,</em> though, is the relationships you build with your friends. In the first game, Aloy is mostly a lone wolf, occasionally partnering with people here and there but mostly doing things on her own. In <em>Forbidden West</em>, though, you establish a posse of capable and likable companions, some old and some new, all of whom bring something different to the table in your massive quest. Trying to fend off the end of the world feels just a little bit easier when you have friends by your side. \u2013 <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350200/IMMORTALITY/\">Immortality</a></h2><div id=\"6e0c6f0aaa394b48a5b41fdb8f4f9345\"></div><p>With <em>Immortality</em>, indie game director Sam Barlow has delivered a tribute to the surreal films of David Lynch, with a dose of Hitchcock for good measure.

The mystery will get you started, but the spooky atmosphere and excellent performances will keep you hooked. <em>\u2013 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.marvelsnap.com/\">Marvel Snap</a></h2><div id=\"8bf36ee351744268853a3346e1884951\"></div><p>After getting burnt out on <em>Hearthstone</em> a few years ago, and superhero movies more recently, the last thing I expected to hook me in 2022 was a comic book-themed collectible card game. But then the fine folks at Second Dinner released <em>Marvel Snap</em> and it quickly became my favorite time waster. Because a match lasts less than five minutes, you can easily play a round during commercials, while waiting for the train, or in the bathroom (I\u2019m not judging). And while decks cap out at just 12 cards, there\u2019s a surprising amount of depth with a huge variety of effects and counters. Meanwhile, thanks to appearances from lesser-known characters like Hell Cow, Devil Dinosaur and the Infinaut, the game has prompted me to learn more about Marvel lore than any of the movies ever did. So even though the game is a little barebones at the moment (the only mode is a basic ranked ladder but more features are on the way), <em>Marvel Snap</em> is sure to be a game I continue playing long after I\u2019ve forgotten about whatever happened in the latest Spider-man movie. \u2013 <em>Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://neonwhite.rip/\">Neon White</a></h2><div id=\"8343ba9eb10b4bf98a99f437c16040f2\"></div><p>What do you do when you love speed running and score chasing, but you're generally not very good at it? You play <em>Neon White</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/atari-pong-arcade-cabinet-anniversary-video-203045522.html\">Like all good games</a>, <em>Neon White</em> is simple to learn, and difficult to master. The basic ask is that you vanquish every demon from a level and head to a finish marker. It plays like a fast-paced first-person shooter, with the complexity coming from your weapons, which are cards that can either fire or be spent for a special movement or attack ability. The <em>real</em> challenge comes from the scoring system, which grades you based on the time you took to complete a level.</p><p>There are just shy of 100 levels, all begging to be learned, repeated and perfected. Despite its first-person shooter visuals, it plays out more like a cross between <em>Trackmania</em> and a platformer. You'll quickly turn that bronze medal into a gold, and then an \"ace\" that is supposedly your ultimate target. Then you'll see the online leaderboards and realize you've left some seconds on the table. Then you'll randomly achieve the secret red medal on a level, say \"oh jesus\" and realize that there's a whole hidden tier of perfection for you to attain.</p><p>The trick is that everything feels smooth, and fast. From my first gold medal time up to the top-ten-in-the-world run I showed my pretending-to-be-interested friends, every time I turned on the game I felt like a master, inches away from perfection. There are multiple paths through each level, ridiculous shortcuts to discover, and near-infinite degrees of satisfaction waiting after every good run.</p><p>The main negative point, for me, is the story, which plays out like a visual novel. I love the genre, and had heard good things about the game's characters, but found the narrative overly slow and just generally dull. There is mercifully a \"fast forward\" button, and once you've played through everything, a level select screen that lets you jump right into the action.</p><p>Despite its storytelling, and a couple of overly long levels that had me gnashing my teeth, <em>Neon White</em> was easily the most fun I had with a game this year. I played on Switch and PC, but a couple of weeks ago it landed on PlayStation as well, and I imagine I'll be starting up a new campaign and playing it all over again soon.<em>\u2013 Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://store.privatedivision.com/game/olliolli-world\">OlliOlli World</a></h2><div id=\"22daf635afb44ff3abe34941ed33ce45\"></div><p>Most of the time, single-player narrative-driven games are where I spend most of my gaming time. But once a year, I come across a game like <em>OlliOlli World</em> that I can play for minutes or hours at a time because the gameplay is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-gameplay-preview-140021521.html\">just so satisfying</a>. The goal in <em>OlliOlli World</em> is simple: become a skateboarding god. You do that by progressing through five worlds, each of which has a dozen or more individual stages, each with a wildly unique course to traverse.</p><p>Unlike the earlier games in the OlliOlli series, <em>World</em> is a bit more forgiving at first. It\u2019s much easier to pick up and start pulling off wild moves and combos than ever before. But it\u2019s still fiendishly challenging \u2013 if you want to beat every challenge, you\u2019ll need lightning-fast reflexes and the mental stamina to change up your tricks and moves constantly. But once you get fluent in the game\u2019s mechanics, you can enter a flow state where you\u2019re just making moves purely on instinct.</p><p>The level and character design in <em>OlliOlli World</em> only enhances this effect. Like the earlier games, each of the five biomes has its own unique characteristics, but in all cases the levels are extremely colorful and interactive, with tons of eye candy and bizarre creatures hanging out in the background. And you can customize your character with clothing and items you pick up for completing challenges, letting you express your personal style in a huge variety of ways. There are also competitive aspects, like the daily challenge where you compete against nine other skaters to post the top score in your group. And every time you visit a level, you\u2019ll see a \u201crival\u201d score to try and beat. There\u2019s always something pushing you to skate even better in <em>OlliOlli World. \u2013 N.I.</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/\">Overwatch 2</a></h2><div id=\"ec7451e2b8c04ad5bea50b22acd47737\"></div><p><em>Overwatch</em> is my second favorite game of all time. Despite sharper, faster-paced gameplay, some much-needed quality-of-life improvements and the free-to-play shift I've wanted for years, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-beta-first-look-160005268.html\"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> isn't quite at that level yet. It's too rough around the edges.</p><p>The monetization changes felt like a gut punch. In fairness, many of the high-end skins cost around the same as what you'd pay for outfits in other major free-to-play titles. But newcomers now need to pay up if they want cosmetics that have been in the game for six years \u2013 items that veteran players were able to earn for free only a few months ago. Players also need to pay for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-explained-pricing-rewards-164051102.html\">premium battle pass</a>, grind through the free tier or wait until it's easier to unlock new heroes in later seasons before getting access to the latest characters.</p><p>And yet, <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a hold over me like no other game. It's still the best multiplayer title around, with a rich lore, a wonderful cast of characters and a colorful aesthetic that helps it stand out from many other games on the market. The ping system is an excellent addition for accessibility, and the four new heroes that have joined the lineup since launch are all a blast. Some of the major hero reworks, especially the Orisa one, have been a resounding success.</p><p>As much as I enjoy the game as it is now, Blizzard has laid the foundations for an even more exciting future. Next year will bring long-awaited, story-driven co-op missions to the franchise \u2013 until now, we've only had a taste of those during seasonal events. After getting a sneak peek at some of the stuff that's on the way to the PvP side in the next few seasons, including a new core game mode and the season four hero, I can't see myself putting this game down anytime soon. <em>\u2013 Kris Holt, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1294420/\">Rollerdrome</a></h2><figure><img alt=\"Rollerdrome\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/3e98e2b0-0c4f-11ed-96dc-e5e0035439c3\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Roll7</div></figure><h2></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rollerdrome-preview-olliolli-skates-ps5-steam-160030108.html\"><em>Rollerdrome</em> is lush</a>. It\u2019s incredibly stylish, taking cues from 1970s Hollywood sci-fi but with an attractive cel-shaded filter over every scene. Even better than its stunning visuals, <em>Rollerdrome</em> has smooth, precise mechanics that allow players to fall into a flow in every level. The game is all about gliding through the environments on rollerblades, picking up speed and doing tricks while dodging and shooting enemies, managing weapons and controlling time \u2013 and it all comes together in a thrilling dystopian bloodsport.</p><p>It\u2019s a joy to dodge, dodge, dodge and then leap into the air, slow down time and take out the people shooting at you, refilling ammo and collecting health in the process. Meanwhile, an unsettling story of corporate greed unfolds naturally beneath the rollerblading bloodshed, keeping the stakes high. <em>Rollerdrome</em> was a sleeper hit of 2022, so if you\u2019ve been napping on this one, now\u2019s the time to wake up and play. <em>\u2013 J.C.</em></p><h2><a href=\"https://stray.game/\">Stray</a></h2><div id=\"e95932d7e1084fbeb3475982949c6f9f\"></div><p>When I fall in love with a game, it\u2019s the setting that gets me, which maybe explains why I wandered around <em>Fallout 76</em>\u2019s Appalachian wasteland long after most people had left \u2013 I wanted to live there. I want to live in the futuristic city where <em>Stray</em> takes place too, but since I\u2019m neither cat nor robot, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed. In the game, you play a standard orange tabby with no special abilities, apart from those given to most felines like agility and jumping prowess. Through a mishap, you find yourself trapped in a domed city populated exclusively by amiable humanoid robots, and you eventually team up with a small drone that lets you \u201ctalk\u201d with those androids.</p><p>To find your way back to your cat family outside the city, you solve puzzles, fight mutant bacterial blobs and generally follow your curiosity. The cityscape is a gorgeous, multi-level cyberpunk playground that feels a little less hardcore than <em>Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s </em>Night City, with plenty of woven rugs to scratch and pillows to nap on. In fact, scratching, napping and otherwise doing cat stuff not only unlocks achievements (I was particularly proud to earn the one for getting a paper bag stuck on my head) they\u2019re also integral to the game.</p><p>As my colleague Jessica Conditt <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/stray-review-ps5-cyberpunk-adventure-cute-cat-173018571.html\">said in her review</a>, Stray is \u201cdownright joyful.\u201d By leaning into the cat premise, it creates a whole new gaming perspective \u2013 you can\u2019t do stuff humans can do, but you <em>can</em> do stuff cats do, like shimmying through small holes and jumping on pipes and bookcases. Living 12 inches off the ground for the cumulative eight hours or so it took me to play the game, I finally understood why cats want to jump on top of everything.

(Oh, and it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/last-of-us-part-1-tlou-pc-release-date-march-3-2023-021024376.html\">coming to PC</a> in early 2023, too.) So, it\u2019s not exactly an <em>essential</em> release if you\u2019ve played it before. But for people who may have heard about the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-the-last-of-us-second-trailer-212931347.html\">upcoming HBO show</a> and want to know what all the fuss is about \u2013 or anyone who loved Joel and Ellie\u2019s journey the first time \u2013 this PS5 version is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-ps5-review-150041410.html\">the definitive way</a> to experience this story.</p><p>The game has been entirely rebuilt from scratch, and it shows in everything from the ruined post-pandemic cities and surprisingly tranquil forests and mountains to the detail found in collectibles around the world. Most crucially, though, the facial animations are simply stunning. Everyone you encounter, whether a lead character or an NPC you only see once, looks amazingly detailed and realistic. Of course, that means the hordes of infected humans hunting you are even more disturbingly detailed than ever, as well.</p><p>The updates aren\u2019t just skin deep, either. Enemies are smarter and more cunning than ever, thanks to developer Naughty Dog using the upgraded AI system they implemented in 2020\u2019s <em>The Last of Us Part II.</em> Humans are more aggressive about flanking you and a lot easier to lose once they find you, while the Infected are even better at hearing you trying to sneak by. There are a host of other updates, big and small, perhaps the most important of which is a massive suite of accessibility features so that almost anyone can give this game a shot.</p><p>What hasn\u2019t changed is the story and script \u2013 but that isn\u2019t a problem, given that <em>The Last of Us</em> was already well-known for its outstanding performances and plotting. The debate on whether or not <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> was really \u201cnecessary\u201d will likely continue, but don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it. If you\u2019ve never played the game before, this is the way to do it. And if you\u2019re like me and play it every year or two, this is the best way to do so. \u2013 N.I.</p><h2><a href=\"https://tunicgame.com/\">Tunic</a></h2><div id=\"81558e6f8cff4129be53fc88694f926c\"></div><p>How do you write about a game that\u2019s best experienced without expectations? That\u2019s the challenge of saying something meaningful about <em>Tunic</em>. You can speak to its influences \u2013 primarily <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening</em>, with a dash of Soulslike combat \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t do the game justice. Worse yet, it fails to capture its appeal. I could also mention its <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GYQyo3CaIZ4\">haunting soundtrack</a> by Lifeformed and Janice Kwan or the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUE1QTd1b0pBT3ZZJmFiX2NoYW5uZWw9Tm9jbGlwQ3JldyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzQzODYyZGQtYzdiZi00ZDkyLWI0MzQtNGUwMTg3MTk0MmVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcXuIVSTl3UZg7nNwDALhDzoLWs3bPC-aTiBFGUoYbsS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DA5A7uoJAOvY%26ab_channel%3DNoclipCrew\">austere beauty of its art style</a>. But again that\u2019s not quite what makes <em>Tunic</em> so special.</p><p>I\u2019m being purposefully vague because to say more would be to rob the game of its magic. So I\u2019ll leave you with this: It\u2019s fitting <em>Tunic</em> casts you as a cutesy fox because the game has a knack of making you feel so clever anytime you work through one of its many mysteries. Do yourself a favor and try to play this one without turning to the internet if you run into a roadblock.

I admit it\u2019s a bit of a slow burn and it gets a bit text-heavy, but with multiple endings (including a New Game+ mode), a deep roster of characters and rewarding turn-based combat, this game has it all. And thanks to its art style, which masterfully blends old-school sprites with a modern 2.5D approach, this game looks and feels like a love letter to those all-time greats of the late 90s. If you\u2019re a fan of tactics games, <em>Triangle Strategy</em> is a must-play. \u2013 S.R.</p><h2><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/\">Vampire Survivors</a></h2><div id=\"6d32367fce614005bb077c1d92324d80\"></div><p>I had such good intentions for my <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a>.

Sure, I do those things, but only on the rare occasion I can rip my attention away from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p><p>It is a rudimentary-looking game with very basic controls. You'll face hordes of monsters, but because your weapons autofire, the only real control you have is using the thumbstick or touch controls to move your character. You'll need to carefully juke away from some enemies while getting close enough to kill others and pick up the experience gems they drop. After you collect enough gems and level up, you\u2019re able to select another weapon or powerup.</p><p>This is where many of the game's intricacies come in. You'll get a random selection of weapons and power-ups to choose from at every level, as well as the ability to make your items more powerful. If you find the right pairings, you can evolve weapons into ultra-powerful forms. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is the perfect distillation of the power fantasy. Flesh out the right build and you'll carve through bosses that once seemed unbeatable like a lightsaber through ice cream.</p><p>This game begs you to keep coming back. Since it debuted in early access last December, developer Poncle has frequently updated the game with more characters, weapons, items and levels. Part of the joy is in building different loadouts that can demolish enemies with ease. Vampire Survivors also shares some DNA with casinos. There's an explosion of color and some upbeat, tension-filled music whenever you open a treasure chest, along with a delightful chime whenever you grab a gem \u2013 you will hear that a lot. These aspects don't exactly make it easy to put the game down.</p><p>I love my Steam Deck. I love <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Together, they have a toxic hold over my desire to play other games.

Because it\u2019s the same puzzle for every single player each day, Wordle was a giant inside joke amongst solvers across international boundaries. At Engadget, for example, London-based Mat Smith could give me hints or laugh at my inability to guess a word he got.</p><p>I also loved sharing and seeing the little blocks that showed how many tries it took us to solve the word. It was a chance to both bond and brag \u2013 the perfect gaming experience. Plus, whenever a word was controversial, whether it was spelled in US or UK English, for example, I loved the inevitable debate that would result. In 2022, Wordle gave us an elevated form of watercooler conversation fodder, but for the entire world.</p><p>Although technically launched in 2021, Wordle found widespread popularity in 2022. It was born from software engineer Josh Wardle\u2019s desire to make a word game for him and his partner Palak Shah to play together. But it was when the user base expanded beyond his family to encompass the entire globe that Wordle took on a life of its own.</p><p>Countless iterations were spawned, building on the format and name\u2026 which itself was based on Wardle\u2019s last name. You may have seen examples like Heardle, Worldle, Squirdle, Absurdle and more, using the puzzle\u2019s format for us to guess songs, countries and other subjects. As always happens with anything popular, hundreds of websites published guides to beating the game, while scores of clones popped up in the Android and iOS app stores, hoping to cash in on the fever. Wardle later <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wordle-nyt-new-york-times-sale-215510156.html\">sold the game to the New York Times</a> for an undisclosed sum that was reported to be in the low seven digits, and soon, just as quickly as the fever started, the game\u2019s popularity subsided. Thanks to Wordle, we all may be leaving 2022 just a little bit savvier about the most common letters and words in the English language. <em>\u2013  Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL2VuLWNhL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3hlbm9ibGFkZS1jaHJvbmljbGVzLTMtc3dpdGNoLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzQzODYyZGQtYzdiZi00ZDkyLWI0MzQtNGUwMTg3MTk0MmVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcoIKrzwqRPRYtPoAG_6oivzwAel_qssJKlG05FOG4v-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-ca%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fxenoblade-chronicles-3-switch%2F\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a></h2><div id=\"15ebdaa36f394ae297d350423431c33e\"></div><p>Getting into a new role-playing game series can be hard sometimes.

So how did <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-direct-xenoblade-chronicles-3-date-153058380.html\"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>weasel its way into my heart? I think it\u2019s because I was told by several people, both gaming critics and friends, that it was a perfect entry into the series, regardless of whether you\u2019d played its predecessors. They weren\u2019t wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s a nice game to approach with a blank slate because it goes through around three different tonal gear shifts before you entirely know exactly what the heck is going on. While I don\u2019t want to ruin the anime-nodding plot twists, several of which you will see coming from a mile away, the game starts with a sci-fi, steam-punk high-concept scenario. Teen warriors on two factions are pitted against each other, waging wars with mechs, but also close-range weapons. It turns out direct kills are the only way to leech their enemy\u2019s life force, building up a store in their base\u2019s \u201cflame clock\u201d and ensuring a squad\u2019s survival. They have to fight, to <em>live</em>.</p><p>Noah and two of his allies clash against Mio and her retinue, and after the battle ends in a draw \u2013 and I get to enjoy a slick, anime-styled battle movie between all six \u2013 the fates conspire to ensure <em>this</em> is your group of warriors, and only they can save the world.</p><p>With a wide range of classes to wield and master, as well as the ability to add a guest warrior to your squad pretty much any time throughout the game, battles initially seem chaotic, but I soon got attuned to the rhythm. Defenders will coax enemies into targeting them, allowing your heavy-hitting attackers to wail on them from the side or back \u2013 positioning is <em>crucial</em>. Meanwhile, your healers will ensure your defender doesn\u2019t fall and amp up damage either with area-specific skills or targeted attacks on enemies. Also, your epic, charge-them-up-in-battle Interlink attacks are accompanied by such a high-energy soundtrack, it\u2019s hard not to feel like a hero.</p><p>There are some big pacing problems in places, and when you get the ability to combine with your allies and form powerful Evangelion-esque avatars, you wonder exactly what can stop them at times. But it\u2019s a vast adventure with several compelling side quests to fill out your time in Aionios. Annoyingly, it\u2019s won me over \u2013 and I have since downloaded the original <em>Xenoblade Chronicles </em>(and its sequel) to play in 2023. <em>\u2013 M.S.</em></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-sci-fi-movies-books-shows-141537070.html?src=rss", "title": "The best sci-fi movies, books and shows to consume over the holidays", "date_published": "2022-12-26 14:15:37+00:00", "description": "<p>If you need a break from the hustle and cheer of the holidays, there\u2019s nothing better than the ultimate escapist genre: sci-fi.

The delight lies in figuring out who these people <em>really</em> are (and what that even means), and sussing out what\u2019s actually going on at Lumon. Gorgeous in a sterile, Apple Store kind of way, <em>Severance</em> is anchored by exacting performances from Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken and John Turturro.

Faced with an Empire that\u2019s disturbingly bureaucratic in its repression, Cassian assists with a heist that prods the Empire to bring down its fist across the galaxy. Watching it gives you a detailed sense of the universe where Star Wars takes place, with fully realized worlds, mature storylines, and characters that don\u2019t feel far, far away.</p><h2>Movies</h2><h2></h2><h3><strong>Prey</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"Naru (Amber Midthunder) and the Predator (Dane DiLiegro), shown.

Special attention was paid to historical fidelity with on-set Indiginous advisors and a largely Indigenous cast playing the Comanche tribe members, proving that when Hollywood makes an effort to get things right, everything only gets better.</p><h3><strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/40e72060-75b6-11ed-bef3-856bfbccdca0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">A24</div></figure><p>We need films like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a40dab20-176b-4e44-8184-98a609e5443d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Showtime&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhNDBkYWIyMC0xNzZiLTRlNDQtODE4NC05OGE2MDllNTQ0M2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hvLmNvbS90aXRsZXMvMzQ5Mzg3NS9ldmVyeXRoaW5nLWV2ZXJ5d2hlcmUtYWxsLWF0LW9uY2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVhOTM3YjlmLWY0YzYtNGUyZC1iZmM0LWM4ZDAwMWNkNDAyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYDnuhE-R4G4nZwpNV4gBsm255tqAWAF-pvDReMClgHx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sho.com%2Ftitles%2F3493875%2Feverything-everywhere-all-at-once\"><em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em></a> to remind us of the pure joy movies can make us feel.

Daniel Kaluuya plays the lead, as he did in <em>Get Out</em>, this time as a laconic cowboy in a trucker hat. Kaluuya\u2019s OJ and Keke Palmer\u2019s Emerald are a brother and sister team running a struggling ranch outside of Hollywood where they train horses for the movies. When nickels and house keys fall from the sky and the horses start running off, they see there\u2019s something parked above the ranch, hiding in an immovable cloud \u2013 something that\u2019s not from here, and definitely not friendly.</p><p>Like everything Peele makes, <em>Nope</em> has plenty of humor to shoot through the tension, and there\u2019s a dose of abounding weirdness \u2013 particularly in a side plot about a sitcom chimpanzee. You also sense a clear love of movies coloring the film, with nods to classics like <em>Jaws</em>, <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> and <em>Alien</em>.

Like <em>Goon Squad</em>, this is a novel told in stories and shifting perspectives. But where the first book focused on music and Gen X aimlessness, this time we\u2019re looking at the technology we willingly give all parts of ourselves to. It\u2019s not hard science fiction, but it does what the genre does best: speculating on a probable future and seeing how we humans react.</p><p>In the near future, a tech giant named Bix (a fleetingly minor character in <em>Goon Squad</em>) creates the next big thing in social media, called the cube, into which you can upload your unconsciousness and share it. Needless to say, there are repercussions. But the effects of the cube aren\u2019t the focus. Instead, technology slips into the lives of the characters, just like all the previously impossible-seeming tech we live with today. Egan is one of the most assured writers I\u2019ve ever read, and the prose is top-form literary stuff. It's never ever boring, and, like the teeming memories of the cube, impossible to look away from.</p><h3>Dead Silence</h3><figure><img alt=\"Dead Silence\n\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/4624faf0-7685-11ed-affd-c20958e92a97\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tor Nightfire</div></figure><p>Pulitzer Prize-level literature is great.

The team gets a faint distress signal from a Titanic-esque spaceship that disappeared decades ago, halfway into its maiden voyage. Naturally they investigate, and things get disturbing when they discover bodies upon bodies inside the ship. Claire also happens to be the sole survivor of a viral outbreak on a Mars outpost when she was eleven, an experience that has left her with PTSD and more than a little unreliability in the narration department. The book is creepy and scary and mind-trippy and reminds me of the twitchy gratification of reading Stephen King as a teenager (with the lights on).</p><h2>Podcasts</h2><h2></h2><h3><strong>Celeritas</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"Celeritas\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/1337f520-75b8-11ed-bf6e-a02a5dfe62bf\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Magnesium Film</div></figure><p>The creators of <em>Celeritas</em> (available on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/celeritas/id1585759882\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1nOTwkIfDVscgd2shkhlZ6\">Spotify</a> and others) bill it as a \u201ccinematic podcast,\u201d which doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s about movies, but rather that listening to it feels as immersive as experiencing something with both sound and picture. And that description is correct. The narrative centers on an astronaut who pilots the first light-speed space flight, and ends up deep in the future after things go awry.</p><p>From episode one, <em>Celeritas</em> expands the possibilities of the aural medium, which you first notice in the thrilling and densely layered sound design. Then there\u2019s the storytelling, which ditches the audiobook \u201conce upon a time\u201d formula for an approach that takes full advantage of radio-play dynamics. Instead of an astronaut on a space walk delivering exposition or narration to us, we instead hear him intersperse his communication with mission control with a message he records for his daughter as he takes care of mundane EVA procedures. The eighth of 12 planned episodes dropped in late November, and new episodes are released roughly every two months.</p><h3><strong>Flash Forward</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"Flash Forward\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3f6a5980-75b8-11ed-b7db-70bc11ad1822\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Flash Forward</div></figure><p>Initially called <em>Meanwhile in the Future</em> when it was launched back in 2015, <em>Flash Forward</em> (available on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/flash-forward/id994349813\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5wsy0tqZZmsINxUlfz0PrA\">Spotify</a> and others) isn\u2019t usually a sci-fi podcast but rather, one that takes a speculative notion \u2013 say, what if all the world\u2019s volcanoes erupted at the same time? \u2013 and then talks with experts to try and answer the question.</p><p>It\u2019s a fascinating show in its own right, but then in October of this year, 27 three- to six-minute episodes dropped all at once.
