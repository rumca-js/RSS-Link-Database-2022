I tried to highlight channels with less than 10 million subscribers just to keep the list trimmed a bit! Many of these channels inspire my work, and give me ideas for videos and projects to follow them up.

Tech YouTube (of all varieties) is a great space to be in, and I hope you're also able to show some support to the other channels above!
