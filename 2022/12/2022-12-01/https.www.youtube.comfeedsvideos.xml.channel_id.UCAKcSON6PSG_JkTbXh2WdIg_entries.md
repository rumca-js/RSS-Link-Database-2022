Philadelphia musician Alex Giannascoli — better known as Alex G — released his latest album, "God Save The Animals," on September 23, 2022.

Shortly afterwards, Alex G went on tour in support of the album. While in the Twin Cities for a show at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Alex G and his band — guitarist Sam Acchione, drummer Tom Kelly and bassist John Heywood — visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Ayisha Jaffer.

In the interview that followed, Alex G spoke with Ayisha about the making of "God Save The Animals." There’s also talk about Alex G’s work scoring a horror film … and Alex G shares his own rather spooky story.

Watch and listen to the complete session above.
