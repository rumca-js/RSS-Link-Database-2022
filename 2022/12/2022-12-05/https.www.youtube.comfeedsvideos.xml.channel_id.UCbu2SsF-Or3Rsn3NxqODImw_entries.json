Jessica Howard goes over what was updated for this remake of a classic game.\n#gaming #gamename #gamespot \n\nMuch like protagonist Zack Fair himself, the story of the self-proclaimed country-boy-turned-SOLDIER-First-Class is not one shrouded in mystery. If you've engaged with Final Fantasy VII or any of its various spin-offs, prequels, remakes, or animated movies, chances are you understand the weight of his legacy--which is, coincidentally, only rivaled by the weight of his sword. However, if you're looking for the definitive way to experience it, look no further than Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion.\n\nA remake of the 2007 PSP exclusive Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core Reunion is a faithful retelling of Zack Fair's story with dramatic visual upgrades, full voice acting, and several quality-of-life changes. Considering the game was already heralded as a fantastic prequel and one of the best titles on PSP, it comes as little surprise that this version is triumphant in making Crisis Core into a modern day must-play for Final Fantasy VII fans. Not only does Crisis Core Reunion port the once fairly difficult-to-find game to several new consoles, allowing for a greater audience to experience the title, it transforms the game from feeling like a smaller, handheld experience into something that can proudly stand beside Final Fantasy VII Remake as a worthy companion.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUnD_SOlTgk", "date_published": "2022-12-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dead Island 2 Full Showcase - Another Day in HELL.A.", "description": "Watch the Dead Island 2 live action and gameplay Showcase featuring slayers, zombies, tones of gore, weapons, and visceral melee combat.

All of this comes to Elden Ring in update 1.08, but the full patch notes haven't been announced yet.\n\nIn a new update from developer CD Projekt Red, we\u2019ve learned Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s online mode became a casualty of the game's turbulent release as the studio was forced to focus all of its energy on fixing the game\u2019s many issues.\n\nWhat that multiplayer game would have looked like remains a mystery, as CD Projekt Red kept details of the project tightly under wraps and seldom spoke of it. Luckily the game\u2019s Phantom Liberty expansion is still on the way for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year as well as a sequel further into the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn update you won\u2019t have to wait for however is the latest for God of War Ragnarok. This update adds a very popular feature for virtual photographers: photo mode. The mode lets players put facial expressions on characters like Kratos, Atreus, and more as well as hide main or side characters, too. What's more, things like field of view, focal length, depth of field, and f-stop can be manipulated. In addition, the photo mode includes film grain and exposure settings to tinker with. There is also the ability to apply borders, logos, and vignettes to any photo.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Elden Ring\n01:14 - Cyberpunk 2077\n01:52 - God of War Ragnarok\n02:27 - Vampire Survivors", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg1-wpqclMg", "date_published": "2022-12-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Breaks Down Different AK Variants - Loadout", "description": "From the classic AK-47 and AKM rifles through to reproductions like the Chinese Type-56, our favourite shooters have featured plenty of the iconic Russian firearm.

A new trailer for the game will also be shown at the event. \n\nAnd the potential release date isn\u2019t the only thing that the Steam page revealed, there were also images that showcased the pre-order bonuses for different versions of the game. These items include some new looks for Cal and BD-1, new Lightsabers and possibly the most exciting addition: different Blaster sets. In Jedi: Fallen Order, Cal didn\u2019t have a gun in his loadout, however it looks like this time around that will change. \n\nGuess we\u2019re just going to have to wait for the Game Awards for confirmation. Lucky for us, Thursday is right around the corner so we won\u2019t have to wait long. On top of that, we won\u2019t have to watch it for very long either as Geoff Keighley has confirmed that The Game Awards 2022 will be much shorter than last year's showcase.\n\nDuring a recent Twitter Spaces talk, Keighley discussed the upcoming ceremony and answered some questions about what to expect. The Game Awards is usually filled with not only award presentations, but interviews with developers and trailers for brand-new games. Last year's pre-show lasted around 30 minutes while the main event went on for 3 hours. During the Spaces talk Geoff said, \"I won't say anything officially until we're through our rehearsals but we think it's going to be significantly shorter.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1aJJyopODs", "date_published": "2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3 PS4 vs PS5 Next Gen Update", "description": "Here's side-by-side gameplay of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt running on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 with ray tracing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLbOS0ExQU", "date_published": "2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3's Next Gen Upgrade Looks Incredible", "description": "The Witcher 3 is back with a fresh coat of paint.
