Frosty the snowman
was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old top hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow


Ooh Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away."

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying "catch me if you can!"

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, saying
"Don't you cry, I'll be back again someday."
