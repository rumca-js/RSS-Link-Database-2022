High on Life is the latest game from Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland's game studio, Squanch Games. It seems Squanch Games has taken the visual and humor style of their former games to create what seems to be their biggest game to date with a humorous FPS adventure game.
#highonlife #squanchgames

High on Life is being developed by Squanch Games. Squanch Games - formerly known as Squanchtendo, was co-founded by Justin Roiland and Tanya Watson, who had previously been an executive producer at Riot Games. Prior to High on Life, Squanch Games had a specific focus on creating games for VR.

High on Life sees you taking control of a character who has recently graduated from High School and has absolutely no dreams or ambitions in life, until Earth is invaded by an alien cartel who want to get High… high on human beings and sell them as drugs. Your character also stumbles upon a foul mouthed talking gun, or Gatlian, named Kenny, and is also tasked with saving more Gatlians who serve as your alternate weapons, and can help you take down your foes.

All of this leads to your character becoming an intergalactic bounty hunter and chasing down the entire alien drug cartel to save humanity.

High On Life releases to XBox One, Xbos Series X/S, and PC on December 13, 2022, with a price of $60. It will also be available on XBox Game Pass on its release date.

Darktide captures the most essential parts of its genre, though it sometimes stumbles when trying to build metagame content on top of that foundation.

## Diablo 4 Hands-On Preview

Diablo 4 is quick to differentiate itself from its predecessors in almost every way, while intelligently iterating on new series staples with ideas that put freedom of play at the center.
#gaming #Diablo4 #gamespot #TheGameAwards 

From the moment I took my first steps onto the frigid mountaintops outside the city of Kyovashad in Diablo IV, it was clear that Blizzard was serious about responding to some of the complaints of Diablo III. While Diablo III contrasted pops of bright colors against the grotesque horrors of the world, Diablo IV is immediately more oppressive and dire in its presentation. Its hues are muted and gray, its world uninviting and harsh, its stories seemingly primed to expose the worst parts of its characters. And yet, it doesn't seek to leave everything of its former entry behind. In many ways, this early slice of Diablo IV offered a good sense of how most of the mechanical changes introduced in Diablo III, and more recently Diablo Immortal, have been smartly iterated on to maintain exciting action with the satisfaction of flexible character construction.  
 
Atmosphere is just one facet where Diablo IV is immediately distinct from the series' previous entry.  I's approach to class builds was divisive, with the far more streamlined approach to ability choices stifling creativity in some cases. Diablo IV rectifies this in some smart ways, while still retaining approachability. The skill tree is made up of distinct nodes, with each one splintering outwards with numerous abilities and associated upgrades. Investing points anywhere in the skill tree works towards unlocking the next node and more abilities, giving you flexibility in how you reach each one. Each node usually offers options for a variety of builds specific to your class. For my Sorceress, each node usually featured a new ability for Frost, Fire, or Lightning builds, with ones further down sometimes swapping out options for one element for passive abilities instead. I was limited to just the first 25 levels in this version of the game (the final release will have a level cap of 100), but even with that limitation I found myself constantly looking to find ways to refine my skill choices between tough fights. 
 
Being able to easily respec is core to the freedom that Diablo IV is designed to give players. At any point you can choose to use gold to refund points spent on a specific ability, or redo your skill tree entirely. There's no special merchant you need to visit, or scarce resources you need to gather. While the cost is still being iterated on, game director Joe Shely explained in an interview that this decision was made to encourage players to personalize their builds throughout their time with the game. 
 
It's easy to think of this system as an intersection of Diablo II and III. While the former offered a detailed way to build some complex classes, it was overly strict with being able to take back early game decisions, limiting you to just a single respec per campaign. Diablo III, conversely, took away most of the choice entirely, handing out abilities linearly and only really allowing you to make some choices (albeit limited ones) near the end of your first campaign. With Diablo IV's approach, you can enjoy experimentation without the fear of looking into choices that might have undesired ramifications hours down the line. I found early on that the combination of Frost spells I had chosen weren't working for strong, single enemies, and it was easy enough to entirely redefine my build after reloading a checkpoint. A few hours later, it was just as easy to switch entirely to a Lightning-based build and experiment with a whole other side of the skill tree, which injected a satisfying new kick into the familiar action role-playing combat that still looks and feels great.

## Need For Speed Unbound Review

Need for Speed Unbound delights with a vibrant new art style and some exciting arcade racing, but familiar issues are as frustrating as an inopportune oil slick.
#GameSpot #NeedForSpeedUnbound #Review

The first thing that jumps out when starting Need for Speed Unbound is its vibrant art style. At a time when most other racing games are striving for photorealism, EA's latest distinguishes itself from the rest of the grid by adopting a stylized mix between reality and comic books. While its cars land on the side of realism, the characters behind the wheel are cel-shaded and its open world falls somewhere in between the two aesthetics. Vivid graffiti-style flourishes also pop up when you activate nitrous or fly off a ramp, and drifting kicks up colorful tire smoke that looks hand-drawn, with all of these effects punctuating the action with a unique sense of style.

There aren't any modern racing games that look quite like it, yet the rest of Unbound feels like a continuation of 2019's Need for Speed Heat. From the distinction between day and night races to the cat-and-mouse chase that occurs when you have to outrun the cops and make it to a safe house in order to bank your money. Unbound doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel, but what's here maintains the series' recent quality, even if there are some wrong turns along the way.

In this episode, We explain Microsoft’s commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms again as well as Elden Ring and Overwatch 2 patch notes.
#GamingNews #MW2 #Nintendo

Would you play Call of Duty if it was on Switch? Because Microsoft has announced a 10-year commitment that will see the franchise published on Nintendo platforms again if the pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. The deal was announced in a tweet by Phil Spencer, who added that Call of Duty games will also continue to be offered for PC players on Steam simultaneously with Xbox.

Imagine a world where Call of Duty is on Switch and not PlayStation. Scary isn’t it. 

You know what else is scary? Fighting people in Elden Ring’s colosseums. The game’s big update launches today, December 7, and thanks to a full list of patch notes we now know what else it includes. There are multiple new hairstyles for players, general balance tweaks, and a series of bug fixes.

Elden Ring Patch Notes:

Overwatch 2 season 2 is now live and the biggest change is the new Tank Ramattra. He can morph into two different forms to change his tactics on the fly. Blizzard also changed up the battle pass to make Ramattra easier to unlock, at level 45 of the new battle pass.
