Glittery Dells have been showing up on store shelves recently and we need to find out why! They're shiny, they're dusty, but are they worth the money?

Update on the warranty: We called up the support line for Advanced Skytech (Treasure Box) secret shopper style. There was no wait time to get an agent, and they walked us through every step of fixing the issue including sending videos to assist us. They were patient and helpful overall. Pretty pleased with how it went.
