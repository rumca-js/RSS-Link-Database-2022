We begin playing at 10AM EST (sharp) and I plan to go until 7PM EST at least
 
The time has come, my bearded bastards, for a new era. Dwarf Fortress has arrived on Steam! Today, i'm going in blind and we're going to spend the day looking through everything this new version has to offer. Get excited! Times are a-changing!
