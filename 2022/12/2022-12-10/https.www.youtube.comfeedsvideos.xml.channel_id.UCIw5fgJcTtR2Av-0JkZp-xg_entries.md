Remix of Angels with Even Filthier Souls / Home Alone 2

Hold it right there!
It's me, Johnny..

I knew it was you.
I could smell ya
getting off the elevator.

It's Gardenias, Johnny..your favorite.

You was here last night too, wasn't you?

I was singing..
at the Blue Monkey last night.

You was here..
and you were smooching with my brother!

That's a dirty rotten lie, Johnny!

Don't give me that.
You've been smooching with everybody!
Snuffy, Al, Leo...
Little Moe with the gimpy leg,
Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...
I could go on forever, baby.

You got me all wrong!

All right, I believe you...
but my Tommy gun don't!

Johnny! You're the only duck in my pond!

Get down on your knees,
and tell me you love me.

Baby! I'm over the moon for you!

You gotta do better than that!

If my love was an ocean,

Lindy'd have to take two airplanes
to get across it.

Maybe I'm off my hinges,
but I believe you.

That's why I'm gonna let you go.
I'm gonna give you till the count of 3
to get your lousy, lying, low-down,
four-flushing carcass, out my door!
1, 2...
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.
And a Happy New Year.
