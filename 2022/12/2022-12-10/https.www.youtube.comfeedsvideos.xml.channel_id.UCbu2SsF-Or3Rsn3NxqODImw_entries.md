From Call of Duty and Battlefield, to Rambo and Commando, the machine gun has long been an iconic entry to the most blockbuster action movie, and an essential part of any video game arsenal for decades. But as games have advanced, the LMG can sometimes feel like it’s been left behind. So what is the virtual legacy of the LMG, and why does it so often feel more like a souped up assault rifle, than a belt-fed banger?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to break down the origins and impact of the Light Machine Gun, and find out why games keep getting the LMG so wrong.
