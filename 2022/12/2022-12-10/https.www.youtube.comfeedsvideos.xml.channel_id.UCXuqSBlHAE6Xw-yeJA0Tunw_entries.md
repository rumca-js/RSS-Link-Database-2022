Linus doesn't travel for projects often anymore, but when Micron invited him out to their 200,000 sq. ft. facilities in Boise, Idaho to make his own RAM from scratch, he knew that he had to go. Making RAM isn't easy, so sit back and take a look at how RAM goes from raw components to powering the device you're watching this on!
