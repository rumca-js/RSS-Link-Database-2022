I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Wonderful Trip to California 1940s, We start with amazing scenes of the city of San Francisco: downtown and residential areas and Bunker Hill, Los angeles  , then we go through the Pacific Ocean Park,  Many great amusement park attractions, rides, snack bars and games

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
