Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is known around these parts as the greatest movie ever made. We already talked about it having the prefect plot. But it's also great in other areas like as a sequel... matched only by the likes of Terminator 2. So in today's Film Perfection, let's look into a few more great sequel qualities in Pirates 2 to learn from. It's an excuse for me to talk about Captain Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones and the Kraken as well. And maybe that way we'll manifest Johnny Depp back as Jack Sparrow for Pirates 6!
