Gameplay of Assassin’s Creed Codename: Jade has reportedly surfaced online and features the game’s combat and traversal as well as a cutscene.
#GamingNews #AssassinsCreed #Leak

Codename Jade is set in China, but fans won’t be seeing the return on AC Chronicles: China protagonist Shoa Jun. Jade will feature a completely new character who is reportedly fully customizable. At this time the game does not have any type of release date information available, but if I were to guess based on the alleged gameplay, I’d guess it's not super far off at this point.  

Don’t recall Jade even getting announced? Well that might be because it was stuffed into an AC Showcase earlier this year alongside the announcement of AC Mirage, Codename Red and Codename Hexe. Red will take place in Japan, while Hexe remains more of a mystery. None of these game have release information either, but earlier this month there were rumors of Mirage looking at an August launch. According to Insider Gaming, the game has already been delayed internally twice, but Ubisoft planned for it to come out earlier in 2023. 

While you wait for those AC experiences to become available, why not jump into Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The 2015 game just got its highly anticipated next-gen update that added ray tracing, a photo mode, new camera options and more. Unfortunately for PC players, the update was a bit broken, causing many to revert their version of the game to a previous version. CD Projekt Red promised to solve the issues and today the game has received its first post hot fix on PC since release of the 4.0 update. This fix weighs in at around 2GB on Steam and on Twitter the dev said it should “ improve the overall stability and performance, and fix GOG & Steam overlays. The game version won’t change.”

Often called the world’s first Assault Rifle, the Sturmgewehr 44 is an essential addition to many second world war movies, TV shows and video games. The rifle has been a huge influence on firearms history, as well as having a recurring role in World War 2 games like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty. And while often one of the most powerful entries in the arsenal of those video games, does the truth of this historic weapon match up to its on-screen legacy, and does its appearance in games today still kick up a storm?
