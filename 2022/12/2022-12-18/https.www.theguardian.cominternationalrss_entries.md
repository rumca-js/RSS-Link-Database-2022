<p>Argentina’s maestro followed his hero in leading his country to the World Cup and completed his collection of titles</p><p>Lionel Messi completed football here, the greatest story ever told. The 26th and last match of his World Cup journey was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">the final to end all finals</a>, a moment that’s never been equalled before and probably never will be again. So wild that none of it made any sense until he was standing there waving to the stands smiling, and then it all did. It was hard to comprehend what he and they had gone through – an entire career, the most accomplished of all, packed into one absurd evening – but there was closure at last.</p><p>It was done. The world had the ending it wanted – Didier Deschamps had said that even some of the French were on Messi’s side – just don’t ask how. Eventually, from somewhere up there, Messi’s mum found her way down to embrace the boy who left home, Argentina, at 13 and the man who had now taken them – or had they taken him? – to the title the most devotional of football fans desperately wanted. Together, they cried. Everyone did. Ángel Di María had spent the evening torn and in tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/18/lionel-messi-authors-dramatic-ending-to-the-greatest-story">Continue reading...</a>

The workers made jeans, denim jackets and other F&amp;F clothes for adults and children for the Thai branch of Tesco’s business between 2017 and 2020.</p><p>Being paid as little as £3 a day to work from 8am to 11pm with just one day off a month.</p><p>Detailed records kept by supervisors seen by the Guardian show the majority of workers on their lines were paid less than £4 a day and only according to how much they could make. The Thai minimum wage then was £7 for an 8-hour day.</p><p>Having to work through the night for 24 hours at least once a month to fulfil large F&amp;F orders, and becoming so exhausted they fell asleep at their sewing tables.</p><p>Some reported serious injuries; one man described slicing open his arm carrying a dangerously heavy interlocker machine, requiring 13 stitches. Another said he lost the tip of his index finger after slicing it in a button machine while making F&amp;F denim jackets.</p><p>Many said they were shouted at and threatened by managers within the factory if they did not keep working overtime and meet targets.</p><p>More than a dozen of the workers interviewed said the factory opened bank accounts for them and then confiscated the cards and passwords so they could make it appear they were paid minimum wage while paying much less in cash.</p><p>Most workers relied on VKG for their immigration status and some said their immigration documents were held by the factory, leaving them in debt bondage. </p><p>Factory accommodation within the compound consisted of overcrowded rooms with concrete floors to sleep on and dirty pond water in a bucket to wash.

<p>Outcry after presenter writes he is ‘dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets’</p><p>A Jeremy Clarkson column in the Sun about the Duchess of Sussex has provoked outcry online, with social media users labelling it “vile”, “horrific” and “abusive”.</p><p>In an article for the paper published on Friday, Clarkson wrote that he loathed Meghan “on a cellular level”.

## Argentina beat France on penalties to win World Cup after stunning final

<p>It was a consecration, the spiritual overtones entirely appropriate. Lionel Messi not only emulated the deity of Argentinian football, Diego Maradona, by leading the nation to World Cup glory, he finally plugged the burning gap on his CV, winning the one trophy that has eluded him – at the fifth time of asking, surely the last time. In the process, he gilded his claim to being recognised as the greatest player of all time.</p><p>When it was over – after the most outlandish of Kylian Mbappé‑inspired France comebacks, the defending champions punching back from the brink not once but twice – when Gonzalo Montiel had dispatched the winning penalty, Messi sank to his knees in the centre circle, engulfed by his teammates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Family traditions are what you make them, Christmas means honouring the people dearest to you</p><p>It’s Christmas Eve. The tree lights are off, pine needles dropping on to presents crammed beneath. Cold air seeps in through the window panes and I pull the duvet up tighter around my ears. As I begin to drift off to sleep, I hear the soft click of the door handle, footsteps padding into the room. I freeze, hold my breath, squeeze my eyes shut. A rustle at the end of the bed and then the footsteps retreat. The next morning, I wake to find a stocking – well, not quite a stocking, it’s a pillow case – stuffed with treats. Among the little gifts is a bag of chocolate coins that I tear into, discarding gold and silver foil as I go. This was my first stocking. I was 19 years old.</p><p>It was my mother-in-law who thought to creep into the room of a young adult on that first Christmas which I spent with my now husband and his family. Her name is Snezana, which means Snow White in Serbian. Her parents emigrated to the UK before she was born. She was there when my husband and I met at university two decades ago and still tells the story of how she saw a spark between us and was convinced that I would be her son’s wife. For her, Christmas represents honouring those you love, and it was important to her to knit me into the tapestry of her family as she sees each new family member as a gift. It is unsurprising, then, that she takes great joy in making this time of year as magical as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/18/growing-up-in-a-different-culture-doesnt-mean-you-cant-love-christmas-too">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This week we publish stories on how to live better with menopause, the impact it has on Australia’s labour market, alongside some personal experiences</p><p>When I was in my early teens, my mother went through stages of being uncharacteristically angry and sometimes tearful for no apparent reason after a lifetime of being pretty mild-mannered and cheerful. She would walk around fanning her face, complaining about how <em>hot</em> and <em>stuffy</em> it was. It was the middle of winter and we lived in the Black Forest in Germany. I put it down to just one more weird thing parents did and never thought to ask her what was going on.</p><p>I forgot all about this over the years as I had children myself. I stopped menstruating after getting ​​an IUD in my early 40s and felt the liberation that comes with one less item of body maintenance.</p><p>We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years, and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes and it is the most … wonderful fucking thing in the world. Yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you’re free. No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You’re just a person. In business.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/menopause-shouldnt-be-a-secret-or-mystery-and-you-shouldnt-have-to-put-up-with-it-in-silence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I missed great games and endured awkward conversations about my decision, but I’m proud I stood by my principles </p><p>When I was growing up, the World Cup always felt like the pinnacle of football. The sticker albums, the wallcharts, the opportunities to relive the greatest moments while having a kickabout with friends. Trying to replicate Ray Houghton’s lofted strike against Italy in 1994; Dennis Bergkamp’s ridiculous pull down and volley against Argentina in 98; or, for when you really didn’t want to be in goal, David Seaman’s desperate backwards flailing against Brazil in 2002.</p><p>While I wasn’t a bad player, the dawning realisation that I’d never get close to doing it professionally didn’t diminish my enthusiasm as a fan, or my interest in finding a career related to football. At university, I sat in the press box at Lincoln City covering matches, and eventually found myself working on one of the longest-running and most successful football video games – one I’d played religiously from my early teens.</p><p>The author is a football fan living in the south of England</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/18/love-football-watching-my-job-world-cup-boycott">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From moon missions to fast-charging batteries and AI-sourced antibiotics, in no particular order, the year’s significant scientific developments</p><p>The year opened with a bang. Or rather, it didn’t. The successful film <em>Don’t Look Up</em>, in which a comet is found to be on a collision course with Earth, had been released just before Christmas 2021. In the bleak days of post-festive gloom, the news media were on an adrenaline high, chasing any and every story about potential asteroid collisions to cheer us all up. Five asteroids were to pass close to the Earth in January alone! Happily for the health and wellbeing of humanity, none was predicted to come within a whisker of hitting the planet. Nonetheless, the possibility of an asteroid colliding with Earth is a reality – the globe is covered in craters from previous impacts, and it is well known that 65m years ago, dinosaurs became extinct following the impact of an asteroid about 10km across. Can anything be done about saving us from this existential extraterrestrial threat? Fortunately, the international space community has taken the first steps towards reducing the risk of an asteroid catching us unawares. The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera/DART">joint Nasa- Esa mission Dart</a> (Double Asteroid Re-Direction Test) was an ambitious attempt to alter the trajectory of a small asteroid (Dimorphos) as it orbited a slightly larger asteroid (Didymos), by sending a spacecraft to crash into it. In October, we learned that the mission had been even more successful than anticipated, and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/11/nasa-dart-spacecraft-asteroid-successful">the orbit of Dimorphos had changed</a> – showing that we could, if given sufficient time, alter the path of an asteroid if it were on a collision course with Earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/18/the-10-biggest-science-stories-of-2022-chosen-by-scientists">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s the fudgy crumb, crackly casing and luxuriant cream centre that elevate this French showstopper above the workaday swiss roll</p><p>I try to embark on these columns with an open mind: to engage the spirit of strict scientific neutrality in pursuit of culinary perfection. Yet, this week, as I rolled roulade after roulade, whipped cream softly spilling on to the counter in front of me, I realised that I was not only striving towards perfection, but attempting to recreate a very specific, decades-old sensory memory. The first mention of chocolate roulade in the British Newspaper Archive comes in 1976, but references peak in the late 1990s, when they also seemed to pop up at every special occasion I attended as a greedy teenager, often accompanied by an equally modish fruit coulis.</p><p>Strictly speaking, of course, a roulade simply refers to anything rolled –<a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/beef-olives-true-comfort-food/"> beef olives</a> are roulades, as are<a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/recipes/chicken-involtini-recipe"> involtini</a> and that <a href="https://www.boursin.com/">French cream cheese flavoured with herbs and garlic</a> – but these roulades were always both sweet and rich enough to react badly with the ill-advised glasses of wine taken beforehand. They were also so delicious that we didn’t care. But even if you don’t have the same fond memories, a roulade has several things to recommend it as a festive dessert: it’s best made ahead of time, it’s often gluten-free and it looks great. So embrace the retro this Christmas – it’s a classic for a reason.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/18/how-to-make-the-perfect-chocolate-roulade-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

## Return of the rhino: can we bring the northern white back from extinction?

An enthralling project to save the northern white rhino is raising challenging questions as scientists debate the ethics of de-extinction<p>When Dr Natalie Cooper, a scientist at the Natural History Museum, met Sudan, the last surviving northern white male rhino, in Kenya before he died aged 45, she understandably feared the subspecies’ extinction was certain – mostly due to poaching fuelled by human greed for the prized horn. “The sense of enormity when staring extinction right in the eye is difficult to comprehend,” she reflects on that 2013 encounter. “It was fairly obvious by that point that the breeding programme wasn’t going to work – the subspecies seemed doomed, it was just a matter of time.”</p><p>But almost a decade later, the world’s rarest large mammal could be on the brink of an astonishing return from functional extinction. The growing efforts to save extant, but seriously threatened, species come alongside a controversial wider de-extinction movement that seeks to bring versions of lost animal breeds, such as woolly mammoths, back to life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/18/return-of-the-northern-white-rhino-back-from-extinction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The footwear at the heart of the age-old panto tale is a satirical jibe at fashionista king Louis XIV’s obsession with ornamental glass and impractical aristocratic styles</p><p>For hundreds of years, the glass slipper has been synonymous with the tale of Cinderella and her midnight dash home from the ball. Now an academic has traced its 17th-century origins and uncovered a connection to the creation of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2022/may/24/high-tides-and-a-versailles-fancy-dress-ball-tuesdays-best-photos" title="">Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles</a> and the impractical fashions and fads of French aristocrats.</p><p>“The glass slipper is a witty joke,” said Genevieve Warwick, professor of the history of art at the University of Edinburgh. It was intended to be a “literary mascot of French economic modernity” and a tongue-in-cheek reference to Louis XIV’s love of extravagant and often quixotic French fashion, especially in regard to shoes, she told the <em>Observer</em>. “No one could actually walk, let alone dance, in shoes made of glass.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/18/cinderella-fairytale-glass-slipper-joke-royalty-louis-xiv">Continue reading...</a>

I will send the smell of roast duck with baked apples and potatoes cooked slowly in more of the bird’s glorious fat out into the garden to tease the neighbourhood foxes. I will also be making a beetroot pie. To balance the roots’ earthy sweetness I will crumble salty white feta into the filling and include the beetroot leaves, too. The pastry will be crisp and buttery filo.</p><p>Actually, I will roast two ducks, the second for tearing to pieces the next day, the cold meat to be eaten with pickled cabbage and slices of the cold beetroot and feta pie. (Little cooking goes on during Boxing Day, though I usually get a pot of bean soup on to simmer.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/18/nigel-slater-recipes-beetroot-and-feta-filo-pie-and-white-chocolate-lemon-truffles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the FA confirming Southgate will stay on, we look at the key reasons and how his plans for Euro 2024 in Germany could shape up</p><p>When Southgate held court with a group of journalists after England’s shattering World Cup quarter-final <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/england-france-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report">defeat against France</a>, he spoke <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/11/gareth-southgate-feels-conflicted-over-england-job-future-after-recent-lows">about feeling “conflicted”</a> as to whether to continue. He cited the principal cause: “The night at Wolves.” The team’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/14/england-hungary-nations-league-match-report">4-0 loss to Hungary</a> at Molineux in June was a horrible low. The venom of the crowd shocked Southgate and the Football Association and it led him to think that the World Cup in Qatar would be his last dance. Southgate always reads the room. He had also said that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/10/gareth-southgate-england-manager-nations-league-italy">not outstay his welcome</a>. He worried he was approaching that point. But during his soul-searching since the France game last Saturday, Southgate surely reminded himself of how he has approached adversity. In 2016, the prospect of a baying mob and personal upset had led him to turn down the England job. He would go on to accept it after Sam Allardyce’s departure and he did so with the words of a close friend in mind. Chris Coleman, his former Crystal Palace teammate, had felt his confidence dented by a dismissal at club level. As Southgate had. But Coleman still stepped up to enjoy success with Wales. Southgate would watch Coleman giving a victorious post-match interview. “Chris spelled it out very simply: ‘Don’t be frightened of going for things in life,’” Southgate said. “It felt like he was talking directly to me.” The sentiment retains its resonance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/gareth-southgate-staying-as-england-manager-why-and-what-next-euro-2024">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Discover breathtaking views, superb food and utter peace on this popular  island on the west coast of Scotland</p><p>However fraught your journey (ours is seven hours, fretting as our electric car battery dwindles), reaching Kinloch Lodge is a joyful corrective. As you cross the bridge to Skye, it’s instantly apparent you’ve escaped the grind – soft ranges of peaks, each fainter and hazier than the last, in shades of lavender and smoke. The sea is everywhere, lapping wild, seaweed-strewn shorelines and filling rock pools. This is why Skye attracts 650,000 visitors a year – it’s legendarily beautiful, a land of fairy pools and exquisite light. In late autumn, however, on the gentle Sleat peninsula in the south, tucked away down a private track, Kinloch has an extra asset: absolute peace. As we get out of the car, stiffly, a shaft of sun pierces the clouds and the sea loch glitters. There’s a smell of damp peat and brine; the only sounds are waves and curlews calling.</p><p>The lodge looks sturdily approachable, not grand. Inside there’s a crackling fire and a welcome glass of fizz in the tiny bar. Staff are smiley and utterly relaxed about our crumpled, crumb-covered appearance. It’s miles away from my childhood Hebridean holidays in spartan self-catering cottages, but also from the constipated jacket-and-tie stuffiness of traditional country house hotels. In the lounge, people curl quietly on fat sofas, doze, eat cake and gaze outside, books forgotten on laps. Our calm, cosseting room has the view, too, from two window seats overlooking the loch. It’s haute comfort; nothing cold, fussy or intimidating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/dec/18/isle-of-skye-scotland-food-whisky-walks-scotland-hebrides-wildlife">Continue reading...</a>

A Danish study shows that children of migrants do better than ‘natives’ when socioeconomic background is applied<p>How should we refer to the children of immigrants? The traditional answer is “second-generation immigrants”, yet “first-generation locals” is far more accurate, as a new <a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_NEW/PUBLICATIONS/abstract.asp?index=9646" title="">research paper</a> co-authored by Alan Manning, one of the UK’s top economists, points out.</p><p>It has more to offer than linguistic improvements. In the US, first-generation locals generally do better than the children of locals. But that’s prompted a puzzle, because in European countries that is often not the case, with the children of migrants having below average educational and labour market outcomes. This has prompted worries from the left about discrimination and from the right about a lack of integration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/18/class-not-parents-place-of-birth-determines-life-chances-of-first-generation-locals">Continue reading...</a>

He has discovered self-restraint, and also maths<p>My son only has one struggle with numbers, and that’s the ones on his Advent calendar. His issue is not with the maths involved, but rather that he wants to open every single window at once and eat them all right now. It dispenses a small chocolate for each day of December and he’s keenly aware that going beyond his daily allotment would betray this pact.</p><p>He hovers over the forbidden windows, paralysed. Finally, he waves his hand to signal I can take it out of his sight, in the manner of a king bored by a meddlesome subject. He keeps to its plan, not out of fear of our authority, or the treacly spectre of heart disease, but out of respect for the numbers themselves. He wants to eat the chocolates, but not as much as he wants the world to know his command of numbers, and their order. Torn between avarice for chocolate and fealty to maths, his respect for the numbers wins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/18/seamas-oreilly-the-advent-calendar-has-taught-our-boy-valuable-lessons">Continue reading...</a>

On the one hand, he’s a creative genius. On the other, he’s destroying a key debating chamber<p>Watching what’s going on at Twitter is like watching a guy losing his mind in slow motion. The guy in question is Elon Musk, who once upon a time was the world’s richest man and now isn’t. (That slot is apparently occupied by <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/30-facts-about-bernard-arnault-new-richest-person-world-3647939" title="">Bernard Arnault</a>, the luxury goods mogul.)</p><p>Musk is in a hole but apparently doesn’t know Denis Healey’s First Law of Holes: when you’re in one, stop digging. The funny thing is that he dug the hole himself. First, he paid way over the odds for Twitter. Then, when Tesla shares (the main source of his wealth) tanked, and Twitter’s share price dropped, he tried to get out of the deal. That failed, so he was forced to borrow a lot of money – incurring interest payments of around a billion dollars a year – thereby becoming the reluctant owner of a loss-making company. And he hasn’t the faintest idea of how to make it work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/18/elon-musk-is-jekyll-and-hyde-character-and-as-head-of-twitter-hyde-is-winning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A chance encounter at a Christmas party churns up buried memories in this exclusive tale by the prize-winning novelist</p><p>It was at a Christmas party in the 1980s. I was very young then, living with my first husband and our three children – the youngest still breastfeeding – in an oversized, dilapidated Victorian house with orange and purple wallpaper, and nylon carpets which gave the children electric shocks. We were supposed to be doing the house up, but that was a joke, partly because we didn’t have any money and partly because my husband was working all hours, trying to get his architectural practice off the ground. At the end of each day I was gratified if I’d managed to get meals on the table, the washing into the machine and out of it again, and all the children into bed. The doing-up anyhow was his idea; I hated DIY and was no good at it. In the evenings, when the children were asleep at last, I turned my back on the wallpaper’s swirling fronds, huddled for warmth under a blanket in one corner of our broken-springed sofa, and read books, which were my salvation. There was a theory in our marriage that I had a career too, as a journalist and reviewer, which I would at some point pick up again. But that was beginning to recede into myth, like the spires of a serene city on the horizon in a painting, ever more distant from the ship I’d sailed in.</p><p>This party was in another oversized dilapidated house, further down the same street, belonging to friends of ours, and I was counting on getting a lot out of it; I was wearing a new red stretch-jersey dress with a full skirt. I didn’t have any exaggerated idea of my attractiveness – I was like those birds the birdwatchers don’t count, a little brown job, and plumper after three children – but I thought that the red dress suited me. I’d had a couple of glasses of strong punch already, and was roaming the party in a state of anticipation that was almost predatory. I wanted life! I wanted to live more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/18/juana-the-mad-a-short-story-by-tessa-hadley">Continue reading...</a>

Now the artists responsible want us all to change how we heat our homes</p><p>Lynmouth Road appears unremarkable. It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations.</p><p>Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop27" title="">Cop27 </a>climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels.

Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station">Continue reading...</a>

Calling out sexual harassment is not soft or ‘being a victim’, whatever the actress may claim<p>Sometimes, being absolutely fabulous isn’t enough to save you from the backlash. So Joanna Lumley discovered last week, after making some scathing remarks on what she perceives as a fashion for victimhood.</p><p>Asked in an interview whether she considered herself a role model for feminism, Lumley nimbly dodged the question, before catching herself on the edge of it and tumbling into a deep hole. She told <em>Prospect</em> magazine that women “were a lot tougher” when she was young and that “it didn’t matter” when you got whistled at in the street back then. “If someone was groping, we slapped their hands,” said Lumley. “We were quite tough and looked after ourselves.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/18/i-understand-why-joanna-lumley-says-women-must-be-tougher-they-already-are">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Mastermind host on why this year we need Christmas more than ever, his admiration for the Ukrainian president and the reason we all love quizzes</p><p>Clive Myrie has just emerged from having his photograph taken – the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk1s">Mastermind</a></em> chair, tangled up in tinsel, has turned sleigh, yanked along by cuddly reindeer. I meet him as he is having fake snow dusted from his hair and is, in his good-humoured way, getting into the Christmas spirit, singing: “Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow…” under his breath. Myrie is a top-notch journalist and a good sport. He is 58 and has worked for more than 30 years at the BBC, familiar to viewers as a distinguished foreign correspondent and as the quizmaster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/22/clive-myrie-to-replace-john-humphrys-as-mastermind-host">who took over in 2021</a> on <em>Mastermind</em>. Now he is briskly changing out of his Christmas trousers and back into mufti: “You don’t mind, do you?” Not at all, I say, and launch into quizzing him about quizzes: how far do quizzes go back in human history? “Erm… Roman times? I don’t know. Victorians loved a quiz… didn’t they?” A comically stumped moment follows. He sits down. Is this “pass” or double fail – I can’t answer my own question (over to you, readers)?</p><p>All right, then: why do we love quizzes so much? “We like to be reminded how smart we are and, because we’re a self-effacing nation, we’re not embarrassed by not getting something right… My whole family would watch <em>University Challenge</em> and <em>Mastermind</em> and if you got a few answers right, you’d think: ‘Hey!’ If you didn’t, it’s only telly – it’s a bit of fun.” I’d have thought the fun was more complicated and had been about to explore the minor mortifications of quizzes.

<p>Photographer Mario Giacomelli’s 1960s shot taken during a rare snowfall on the Adriatic coast captures the distractions of the contemplative life</p><p>It doesn’t snow very often on the Adriatic coast of Italy, perhaps two or three days a year. The rarity of the event helps to explain some of the joy of Mario Giacomelli’s famous pictures of young priests in his home town of Senigallia, enjoying some winter fun in the early 1960s. Scenes like this one were something of a gift for Giacomelli, who loved the possibilities of silhouette, the graphic simplicities of true black and white. The contrast, accentuated by the photographer’s slow shutter speeds and hand printing, gives the pictures their otherworldly dimension, as if the young priests are floating in the air.</p><p>The image is a natural fit in a new collection of photographs exploring the idea of “presence”. Its ethereal quality is given substance, grounded by the surprising informality of the young men’s interaction. Giacomelli spent a couple of years winning the trust of the trainee priests, so that he could capture something of the intimacy of their community. His ambition, he said, was to discard “the conventional rules in my treatment of the subject, to reveal the naked man”.</p><p><em><a href="https://aperture.org/books/presence-the-photography-collection-of-judy-glickman-lauder/">Presence: The Photography Collection of Judy Glickman Lauder</a></em><a href="https://aperture.org/books/presence-the-photography-collection-of-judy-glickman-lauder/"> is published by Aperture (£40)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/18/the-big-picture-young-priests-having-a-ball-in-the-snow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Image was among the possessions the Posner family fled Kiel with and now returns to the city as part of an exhibition</p><p>When she used her compact camera to capture the view from her window in the German city of Kiel one December afternoon in 1931, Rosi Posner was doing more than just taking a snapshot. In the foreground is a brass menorah, the candlestick used to mark the Jewish festival of Hanukah; in the near background, the chilling image of a swastika flag flying prominently from the Nazi headquarters that had opened up opposite her flat earlier that year.</p><p>“Most Jews, after the rise of the Nazis, pulled their curtains shut so that the chanukiah (menorah) couldn’t be seen from the street. But she was determined to show she and her husband were not afraid,” says Nava Gilo, Rosi’s granddaughter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/18/photo-taken-by-rabbis-wife-in-1931-symbolising-jewish-defiance-of-the-nazis-comes-home">Continue reading...</a>

## Why swearing is a Christmas stress-buster

It may be the season of goodwill to all, but research shows that a burst of colourful swearing relieves stress and promotes bonding. Happy effing Christmas!<p>I’m sitting in a polite home in southeast London shouting, “Go piss up a rope ya fuckstick,” at a sofa cushion. This odd ejaculation is at the behest of Australian singing teacher Sam, who’s part of today’s four-woman therapeutic “cursing circle”, a group therapy trend that emerged, like all things in fringe therapeutics, on the west coast of America.</p><p>Sam, our group leader today, sees her compatriots’ reputation as experts of the profane as a form of honest discourse that might help uptight Britons improve our intimate relationships and let off steam. And it’s something that could be especially helpful at this time of year: a way of venting after a festive overload of troublesome relatives or office Christmas parties. Perhaps best not to vent in company, though, as Sam recommends hollering therapeutic profanities at volume towards inanimate objects when you are alone. This year, try dreaming of a blue Christmas rather than a white one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/18/why-swearing-is-a-christmas-stress-buster">Continue reading...</a>
