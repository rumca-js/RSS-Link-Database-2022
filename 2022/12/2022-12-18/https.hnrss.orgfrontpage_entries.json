Slauth auto-generates IAM policies in order to save engineering time and make your policies more secure.<p>If you're an engineer, you probably know how tedious and error-prone it can be to manually write IAM policies. We surveyed over 70 engineers and found out that a majority are using or have used wildcards (*) in order to quickly write IAM policies.<p>By using client-side monitoring or via a proxy, Slauth.io observes all of the API activity and generates a policy based on functionality and least privileges.<p>Once deployed in a remote environment, or run locally, you will need to run an end-to-end test using a wildcard policy. Slauth will observe the activity, apply its logic based on large amounts of behavioral patterns of the service you deploy, and create a high quality IAM policy.<p>The IAM policy will be presented through the Slauth Dashboard where it can be copy/pasted or as a pull-request into your Git repository ready to be reviewed. Integrations with IaC services such as Terraform are also available.<p>Our objective is to automate manual error-prone IAM policy writing in order to increase engineering velocity, reduce friction and harden security.<p>Would love your feedback on the value proposition and if you would use the AWS SDK or Slauth proxy for onboarding.<p>Feel free to also sign up for Beta usage! https://www.slauth.io</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038663\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038663</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/stokesneuro/status/1604369158883491841", "title": "I\u2019ve been battling cancer last 2 years only have a few days left", "date_published": "2022-12-18 15:33:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stokesneuro/status/1604369158883491841\">https://twitter.com/stokesneuro/status/1604369158883491841</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038601\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038601</a></p>\n<p>Points: 58</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss", "title": "Winter & Cold Weather EV Range Loss in 7,000 Cars", "date_published": "2022-12-18 15:31:15+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss\">https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038582\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038582</a></p>\n<p>Points: 54</p>\n<p># Comments: 47</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34038542", "title": "Ask HN: How do people find your blog?", "date_published": "2022-12-18 15:26:05+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I've seen a few posts encouraging people to start blogging or collect their TILs in the form of a blog. I find this to be a great idea, but if it's meant to be public, how would you approach the sharing of this information?<p>I don't love the idea of spamming social media with links just to get people to discover your blog, but maybe that's the best approach.<p>The other option I guess is to just post and let it be discovered, but would that ever happen organically in today's internet?<p>From the other end, as a reader, how do you keep track of interesting blogs? Is RSS still being used?

And that therefore ElonJet or anyone else tracking them is doing more than just republishing public information because you have to first deobfuscate the PIA code.<p>It's false: None of the aircraft Musk has been using are currently using PIA transponder codes or have been recently, and you can verify that for yourself.<p>What PIA does is assign you a fresh non-traceable ICAO hex code every 60 days for each aircraft in the program. You are then responsible for keying that code into your aircraft's transponder each time you get a new one. If you don't change the transponder code there's no additional privacy, as the transponder broadcasts its original identity.<p>This is what an aircraft in the PIA program looks like on ADSB Exchange: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a0fe01<p>Note the 'PIA' flag and lack of additional information that would normally be pulled from the registry. If you convert that to the registration using an online lookup tool[2] you get N163NB, a fake record.[3]<p>Musk uses three jets, N628TS, N272BG, and N502SX. None are using PIA codes and all are easily visible on ADSB Exchange and most importantly have are still using their ICAO hex codes that are listed publicly along with ownership information on the FAA registry.<p>In fact, N628TS is airborne over the Middle East right now using its original assigned ICAO hex code of A835AF, not a PIA code.<p>Perhaps his aircraft have used PIA codes in the past, but they're not using them now. Here's Aric Toler of Bellingcat making the same point: https://twitter.com/AricToler/status/1603802439232241665<p>In our discussions on HN we should at least be able to agree on basic facts like these, and avoid repeating the claims made by those with an interest in confusing the issue.<p>N628TS:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a835af<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=628TS<p>N272BG:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a2ae0a<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=272BG<p>N502SX:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a64304<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=502SX<p>[0] https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603803508087537665<p>[1] https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/equipadsb/privacy<p>[2] http://www.avionictools.com/icao.php<p>[3] https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=163NB</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037780\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037780</a></p>\n<p>Points: 82</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-copyright-office-rules-ai-art-cant-be-copyrighted-180979808/", "title": "U.S. Copyright Office Rules A.I.

Stripe for about 2 years to run a fashion brand in the uk. In the case of my business, I never had an issue processing my small payments for dresses, ranging from a couple hundred dollars up to $1000. All of a sudden, we start getting attention we get payments of  $3300 and more. We had around 50000$ dollars on stripe.  Stripe flagged the account and is now holding the money from me for \"at least 120 days\"<p>It is one thing to say this is a red flag, fine... I hear you... no problem. a transaction multiple times the size... sure. I get it. However, A normal payment processor would then query you for documents authorizing the charge, bank statements, financial statements, some sort of procedure to remedy the issue. Stripe provides NO SUCH METHOD TO RESOLVE these issues.<p>There are reports of Stripe continuing to add \"30 days\" to the reserve hold past the initial 120 days, indefinitely. Stripe is taking advantage of a lack of regulation in this space to steal small merchant's large transactions. They see a big, outlier transaction and lick their chops, hiding behind KYC and \"Fraud prevention\" To hold your money indefinitely.<p>You cannot call Stripe. They do not have a phone number. Their support page on their website has Phone call and messaging grayed out. You can only email. If you email, you get robots. Even in the same email thread, a different \"agent\" (with a different name and everything) answers each time with not prior knowledge of your history. There are no ticket numbers to your support request; nothing tracking it. The robots respond with what is quite obviously a template response.<p>If you do a little bit of research about this topic, you immediately see this is a prevailing issue. Reports of Stripe taking up to $31,000 are all over the internet! Again, Stripe gives no manner to remedy this. There is NO ONE you can call. NO ONE you can talk to. More disconcerting, it seems that anyone who posts about this issue on reddit gets downvoted and teamed up against by established Reddit accounts, that I have to imagine are owned by Stripe. These account have some established reddit history on them, mainly talking about coding in PERL. It's a little sus.<p>In my case, I sent my EIN letter, Sales Tax Receipt, Articles of Org, Statement of Trade Name, Certificate of Good Standing, Bank Statements, Website links, Signed transaction receipts, and anything I could think of to Stripe to review. I just received robot-responses.<p>I challenge anyone here to connect me to a human being at Stripe that can tell me how to resolve the issue. It can't be done. This is a big problem and should be brought to the attention of small business owners, and regulators!<p>TL;DR: Stripe is a faceless enterprise with no humans you can talk to, no publicly listed phone number, and will allow your small account to operate just fine for a while. As soon as they see that you are growing (and thus your chances of leaving Stripe for a larger, more favorable processor) they will Freeze your account, disallow you to issue refunds, and hold your money indefinitely. You've been warned!!!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035581\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035581</a></p>\n<p>Points: 133</p>\n<p># Comments: 28</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "http://unicon.org/book/ub-nightly.pdf", "title": "Programming with Unicon [pdf]", "date_published": "2022-12-18 06:34:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"http://unicon.org/book/ub-nightly.pdf\">http://unicon.org/book/ub-nightly.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035533\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035533</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://quillette.com/2022/12/17/americas-forgotten-crisis/", "title": "America\u2019s social and political turmoil during the 1910s and 20s", "date_published": "2022-12-18 05:14:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2022/12/17/americas-forgotten-crisis/\">https://quillette.com/2022/12/17/americas-forgotten-crisis/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035249\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035249</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.devever.net/~hl/acme-caa-live", "title": "Let's Encrypt now supports ACME-CAA: closing the DV loophole", "date_published": "2022-12-18 04:51:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.devever.net/~hl/acme-caa-live\">https://www.devever.net/~hl/acme-caa-live</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035148\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035148</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 22</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/12/18/", "title": "Quite OK Image is now my favorite asset format", "date_published": "2022-12-18 04:20:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/12/18/\">https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/12/18/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035024\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035024</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.philosophybro.com", "title": "Philosophy Bro", "date_published": "2022-12-18 02:16:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.philosophybro.com\">https://www.philosophybro.com</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034430\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034430</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023", "title": "Show HN: A Highly Opinionated, Fully Functional Obsidian Vault", "date_published": "2022-12-18 02:13:30+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023\">https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034414\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034414</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://worthdoingbadly.com/appkitcompat/", "title": "These 299 macOS apps are so buggy, Apple had to fix them in AppKit (2018)", "date_published": "2022-12-18 02:13:22+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://worthdoingbadly.com/appkitcompat/\">https://worthdoingbadly.com/appkitcompat/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034413\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034413</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/abb128/LiveCaptions", "title": "Live Captions: an application that provides live captions for the Linux desktop", "date_published": "2022-12-18 01:20:15+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/abb128/LiveCaptions\">https://github.com/abb128/LiveCaptions</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034121\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34034121</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}], "source": {"url": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hacker News - frontpage"}}
