[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Boston Solstice 2022 Retrospective", "description": "<p><span>\n\nLast night was our first full in-person Boston Secular Solstice since\n</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-solstice-2019-retrospective\">2019</a>, and I was\nback in the \"music director and host\" role while Taymon did most of\nthe organizing.  Overall I feel like it went pretty well!  People had\na good time, minimal technical issues, lots of good feedback afterwards.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWe had about 35 people, which was about right for the space during the\nevent. If we had had a few more we still would have been able to seat\nthem with folding chairs in a place where they couldn't see very\nwell. This was a bit too many people, though, for moving around easily\nduring intermission. We had about 28 chairs plus room for about 12 on\ncouches, and they weren't all full.  Here's the layout I used:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-layout-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-layout.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPretty similar layout to <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-solstice-2019-retrospective\">last time</a>, but with\nonly one floor futon and slightly tighter spacing in the back rows.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe had the windows partway open and an air purifier running at each\nend of the room, but in retrospect I wish I had asked some of the\nattendees if they could bring along additional purifiers.  We didn't\nrequire masks, but I put up a sign saying: <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/masking-to-avoid-missing-things\">something like</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nVisiting\nelderly relatives this season? Have events you'd be really sad to\nmiss? Consider a mask &#8595;\n</blockquote>\n\nThe sign was above a box of n95s, and I think I saw several people in\nthe kind of mask I put out.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI set up a PA speaker on a stand just to the left of the projection,\nand amplified everything: keyboard, electronic drums, overlays, a mic\non a stand for me at the keyboard, and a mic for the reader or lead\nsinger. I was worried that the big speaker on the stand would feel to\nobtrusive, but with it up by the ceiling I think it was fine.  Getting\nit <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/simple-contra-speaker-placement\">high and angled\ndown</a> mostly avoided the problem where it's too loud for people at\nthe front and too quiet for people at the back.  In past years we\nhaven't used amplification, but with the sound of air purifiers and\nmost speakers masked we really needed it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-front-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-front.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-back-rows-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"623\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-back-rows.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAlex led half the songs and I led the other half.  Alex was great, and\nI'm very happy he stepped up, but in future years I'd love to get a\nwider range of song leaders.  I'd also prefer not to lead any myself,\nso I can focus on playing. If you're interested in helping lead songs,\nlet me know!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe didn't have separate person adjusting levels and running sound\nduring the event, but Miranda helpfully accepted being volunteered for\nthe role.  I had the mixer where I could adjust things while playing,\nand she signaled to me what was needed.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI also made a multi-track recording, including two room mics. I tried\nto get the room mics high up, so they wouldn't just be recording the\nclosest few singers, and and oriented them away from the speakers, so\nthey'd mostly not pick them up.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-my-corner-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-my-corner.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAll the music was live.  The accompaniment was mostly me on piano, but\nI also played some drums with my feet and used a few keyboard\noverlays.  There was also one set (Bitter Wind Blown) where I used a\nbreath controller to play something more windlike.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLily was very concerned about fire safety for the event, but instead\nof the candles she was mostly worried about the extension cords for\nthe PA system.  Teaching kids relative risk, as opposed to working\nthrough a checklist, is hard.  It doesn't help that the fire safety\nbooklet she got from school wants us to unplug our appliances when\nwe're not using them.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-lily-fire-safety-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-lily-fire-safety.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI started setting up the space in the morning, and it was nice to be\nable to take a very relaxed approach about it where I just slowly\nmoved things around all day with a lot of breaks to do other things. I\nthink if I had to I could get the space set up in about 2 hours with\nno PA, and then I probably spent another hour setting up musical and\nrecording equipment.  One of our housemates is only here part-time and\nis currently away. It was super helpful to be able to use their room\nfor storing all the stuff I moved out of the common area to make\nspace.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAs in past years I put a copy of the slides online at a short URL with\na few signs around the room so that people who had seats with a poor\nview of the projection screen could still follow along the\nlyrics. This is also insurance against the projector breaking, that we\ndidn't have any issues with it this year.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe candles were again a lot of fun for the kids (now plural!) to\nprepare.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-peeling-candles-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-peeling-candles.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nI have mixed feelings on how we did candles this year. We lit them\nduring Brighter than Today, with the match struck on \"spark of light\nand flame\" as Ray <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X9RTd4pGoCXwQ2gdC#Fj5kgTLR49EsefuTo\">suggested</a>,\nand the spreading of candlelight during the song felt really good. On\nthe other hand, we also turned the lights up during the song, which\nmeant that we weren't spending very much time with everything lit only\nby candlelight. Talking to people afterwards and thinking back about\nwhat we did in 2019, I think what I'd want to do next time is start\nthe second half by candlelight with the lights off.  As things got\nemotionally darker we'd extinguish the candles, and then do the same\nrelighting as this year. I think this gets all three of the things\nthat I want: a substantial portion of the event by candlelight, light\nspreading during \"Brighter than Today\", and a full return to\nbrightness by the end of that song.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-audience-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-audience.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nJulia had the kids upstairs, though she came down some with Nora to\nwatch and sing when the older ones were engrossed in video.  This is\nalso the first time other parents brought any of their kids, and we\nhad a very cheerful and quiet four month old up front.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-taymon-words-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022-taymon-words.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe music was:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><i>Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</i>, by Eric Idle\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-01-always.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-01-always.mp3\">mp3</a>)</p></li>\n\n<li>\n<p><i>The Circle</i> by Taylor Smith\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-02-circle.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-02-circle.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nI messed up putting the lyrics slides together, and left out a slide\nthat should have contained two of the verses.\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p><i>The Ballad of Smallpox Gone</i> by Leslie Fish\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-03-plague.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-03-plague.mp3\">mp3</a>)</p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>The X Days of X-Risk</i> by Ray Arnold to traditional music.\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-04-xrisk.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-04-xrisk.mp3\">mp3</a>)</p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>We Will All Go Together When We Go</i> by Tom Lehrer\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-05-go.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-05-go.mp3\">mp3</a>)</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIntermission.\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><i>Bitter Wind Blown</i> by Ray Arnold\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-06-bitter.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-06-bitter.mp3\">mp3</a>)</p></li>\n\n<li>\n<p><i>Hymn of Breaking Strain</i> by Julia Ecklar and Leslie Fish to\nwords by Rudyard Kipling.\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-07-strain.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-07-strain.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nWe did this unaccompanied this year, partly for variation but mostly\nbecause Taymon likes having the darkest song of the evening a cappella.\nI like this too.\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><i>Brighter than Today</i> by Ray Arnold.\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-08-brighter.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-08-brighter.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nWe've continued doing the <a href=\"https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/brighter-than-today\">2013\nversion</a>, while everywhere else has standardized on a <a href=\"https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/brighter-than-today-4\">somewhat\nsimpler version</a> that feels a bit too repetitive to me. I think the\nversion we've stuck with is better song, and I don't mind that what\nwe're doing is slightly different than elsewhere, but I'm curious what\nother people think?\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><i>Level Up</i> by Vienna Teng, simplified\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-09-levelup.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-09-levelup.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nAlex and I simplified and consistencified this for group singing. I\nhaven't been that happy with <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/resetting-somebody-will-v2\">past attempts</a> to simplify\nsongs for these events, but I feel like this one went very well. The\nmain changes were making it square, leaving out some of the words so\nthat people consistently start singing at the same time, moving the\nbridge earlier so that the final build and ending of the song aren't\ninstrumental, and making there be a more consistent chorus by removing\nmost of the variation there. Lots of positive feedback on this one!\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nI did play it too fast: I started about where I intended (85-90bpm)\nbut didn't manage to keep it there, and 100-105 means not really\nenough time to get the words out.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nI could see people clapping on 2 and 4 working well for this?\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p><i>Old Devil Time</i> by Pete Seeger\n\n<br /><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-10-devil.mp3\" style=\"height: 1em;\"></audio> (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2022/solstice-2022-10-devil.mp3\">mp3</a>)\n\n</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSlides, with lyrics: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GSjegRJd8Lmg7uS7iUWPQfmaNxrB8Wjw-8lPKDrrMu8/edit\">online</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm interested in feedback about how it went, including critical stuff!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02kqv5VH51DvrURUXbLXb2c2xphA9e3TYvkKCVNhsdu9EA82UW6vRsh3vgmMbbpWF5l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109536213582393654\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-solstice-2022-retrospective", "date_published": "2022-12-18 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
