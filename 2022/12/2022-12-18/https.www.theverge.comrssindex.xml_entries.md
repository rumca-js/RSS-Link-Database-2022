  <p id="LVRwp5">Twitter will no longer allow users to promote their presence on certain social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr, and Post. In <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy">a post outlining these changes</a>, Twitter says it will take action against accounts that violate this policy “at both the Tweet level and the account level.”</p>
<p id="tuqBo6">This means users can no longer include a link to their profiles on other social networks in their Twitter bio, nor can they link to their posts on banned platforms unless it’s a cross-post. Twitter also says it may suspend accounts “used for the main purpose of promoting content on another social platform” and will no longer allow users to link to third-party link aggregators, like Linktree or Lnk.bio.
