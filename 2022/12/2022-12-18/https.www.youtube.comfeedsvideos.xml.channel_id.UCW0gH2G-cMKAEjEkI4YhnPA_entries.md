HOW IT WORKS:
1) Pull up The Two Towers (EXTENDED EDITION) - your DVD, Bluray, or Digital Copy. (It's also on streaming on HBO Max or Prime Video.)
2) Use a second screen, phone, tablet, or whatever to pull up this stream.
3) We all start playing the film at the same time, watching together.  I'll have special guests and we will read your comments, answer questions, and share thoughts in our own in kind of a running "Fan Commentary" with the film.

*If you are unaware, I cannot legally stream the actual film, which is why we will merely be syncing together in this watch party format.  I will have a running timer throughout, so if you come late or get interrupted, you can easily locate our position in the film!
