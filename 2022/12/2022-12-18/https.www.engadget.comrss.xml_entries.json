These images created a public narrative that Mr. Bankman Fried\u2019s interest in <em>League of Legends, </em>once relatable and human, was now reckless and juvenile,&quot; Riot states. \u201cEven Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s ranking in <em>League of Legends </em>has been the subject of online commentary with public figures <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/aoc-league-of-legends-crypto-ranked-bronze-sbf-ftx-1849791131\"><ins>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</ins></a> and Elon Musk weighing in.\u201d</p><p>If you think Riot is ready to swear off crypto because of one high-profile implosion, think again.

According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-18/when-will-apple-aapl-release-the-apple-silicon-mac-pro-with-m2-ultra-chip-lbthco9u?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em><ins>Bloomberg\u2019s</ins></em><ins> Mark Gurman</ins></a>, Apple is developing \u201cmultiple new external monitors,\u201d including a refresh of its 32-inch <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-apple-retina-6k-display.html\"><ins>Pro Display XDR</ins></a> from 2019. Details on the upcoming screens are sparse, but Gurman suggests they\u2019ll incorporate built-in Apple Silicon chipsets like the Studio Display, which features a dedicated A13 Bionic processor. He adds that the updated Pro Display XDR could ship after the M2 Mac Pro arrives (more on the computer in a moment).</p><p>It\u2019s unclear if Apple\u2019s slate of new monitors could include a Studio Display refresh. As <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/\"><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em><ins> points out</ins></a>, display analyst Ross Young tweeted in October that the company was preparing to release a monitor with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/06/apple-mini-led-display-q1-2023/\"><ins>27-inch mini-LED panel</ins></a> in the first quarter of 2023. Based on the specs Young shared, it looked like Apple was planning to update the Studio Display with its ProMotion technology.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Gurman also provides an update on the long-rumored M2 refresh of the Mac Pro. In October, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-pro-m2-ultra-extreme-report-215731047.html\"><ins>he reported</ins></a> the computer would ship with an optional \u201cExtreme\u201d variant of the company\u2019s M2 chipset that was reportedly slated to feature a processor with up to 48 cores and 256GB of memory. Since then, Gurman says Apple has abandoned those plans.</p><p>\u201cBased on Apple's current pricing structure, an M2 Extreme version of a Mac Pro would probably cost at least $10,000 \u2014 without any other upgrades \u2014 making it an extraordinarily niche product that likely isn't worth the development costs, engineering resources and production bandwidth it would require,&quot; Gurman writes.</p><p>As things stand, the remaining model will reportedly feature an M2 Ultra chipset with up to 24 CPU cores, 76 GPU cores and at least 192GB of RAM. Additionally, Gurman says the new Mac Pro retains the current model\u2019s expandability, including the option to add more memory. It will be interesting to see how Apple offers that kind of upgradability since the company\u2019s current chips <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/m1-mac-ram-and-ssd-upgrades-possible/\"><ins>feature soldered RAM</ins></a>.</p><p>Apple was supposed to finish transitioning its computer lineup to Apple Silicon two years after the release of its first M1 chip. According to Gurman, feature tweaks and a change in Apple\u2019s manufacturing plans are among the reasons why it\u2019s taken the company so long to announce a new Mac Pro. Barring any additional delays, the new model will likely arrive sometime next year, though Gurman did not speak to a specific timeline.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-developing-new-pro-display-xdr-monitor-194353294.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-18 19:43:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter bans links and username mentions relating to Facebook, Instagram and other rivals", "description": "<p>While many people were turning to Twitter on Sunday to watch the World Cup finals unfold, the company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1604531261791522817?s=20&amp;t=wZVbz0iUccI1-PA8HC6uaA\">introduced</a> a new policy banning &quot;free promotion&quot; of competing social media websites.

They offer improved audio quality, an even better transparency mode and the addition of touch volume controls. Apple also redesigned the accompanying charging case to make it sweat- and water-resistant and add a built-in speaker to make finding the case easier to find if you ever misplace it. About the only area where the 2022 AirPods Pro disappoint is battery life. You can expect about six hours of use from the earbuds on a single charge. That's more than you could get out of the first-generation model, but less than some competing options offer. Still, the AirPods Pro are among the best earbuds you can pair with an iPhone, and a $50 discount makes them even more compelling.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-sale-amazon-162120383.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-18 16:21:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
