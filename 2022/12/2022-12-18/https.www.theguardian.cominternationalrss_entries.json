In the bleak days of post-festive gloom, the news media were on an adrenaline high, chasing any and every story about potential asteroid collisions to cheer us all up. Five asteroids were to pass close to the Earth in January alone! Happily for the health and wellbeing of humanity, none was predicted to come within a whisker of hitting the planet. Nonetheless, the possibility of an asteroid colliding with Earth is a reality \u2013 the globe is covered in craters from previous impacts, and it is well known that 65m years ago, dinosaurs became extinct following the impact of an asteroid about 10km across. Can anything be done about saving us from this existential extraterrestrial threat? Fortunately, the international space community has taken the first steps towards reducing the risk of an asteroid catching us unawares. The <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera/DART\">joint Nasa- Esa mission Dart</a> (Double Asteroid Re-Direction Test) was an ambitious attempt to alter the trajectory of a small asteroid (Dimorphos) as it orbited a slightly larger asteroid (Didymos), by sending a spacecraft to crash into it.

I was very young then, living with my first husband and our three children \u2013 the youngest still breastfeeding \u2013 in an oversized, dilapidated Victorian house with orange and purple wallpaper, and nylon carpets which gave the children electric shocks. We were supposed to be doing the house up, but that was a joke, partly because we didn\u2019t have any money and partly because my husband was working all hours, trying to get his architectural practice off the ground. At the end of each day I was gratified if I\u2019d managed to get meals on the table, the washing into the machine and out of it again, and all the children into bed. The doing-up anyhow was his idea; I hated DIY and was no good at it. In the evenings, when the children were asleep at last, I turned my back on the wallpaper\u2019s swirling fronds, huddled for warmth under a blanket in one corner of our broken-springed sofa, and read books, which were my salvation. There was a theory in our marriage that I had a career too, as a journalist and reviewer, which I would at some point pick up again. But that was beginning to recede into myth, like the spires of a serene city on the horizon in a painting, ever more distant from the ship I\u2019d sailed in.</p><p>This party was in another oversized dilapidated house, further down the same street, belonging to friends of ours, and I was counting on getting a lot out of it; I was wearing a new red stretch-jersey dress with a full skirt.
