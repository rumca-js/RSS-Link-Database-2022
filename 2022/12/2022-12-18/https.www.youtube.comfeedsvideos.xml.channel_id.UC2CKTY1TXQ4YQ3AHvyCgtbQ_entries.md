Xmas is next weekend, and I've got some ideas about what I'd like from Santa... and it might not be what you think! We'll talk about that, and of course I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
