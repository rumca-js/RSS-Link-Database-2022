Why is the sky blue? Who created the platypus? And who are all the famous friends convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein provided underage girls to for them to sex up? Epstein knew, and critics say he killed himself. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-associate-dead-jail\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein's pimp knew</a>, and critics say that he too killed himself. Epstein's top b*tch Ghislaine Maxwell knows, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-softball\" target=\"_blank\">and she's living her best life</a> in prison while her client list remains unknown and no one in the press is curious enough to ask.</p><p>Now thanks to an unsealed email, there are clues! Alleged victim Sarah Ransome claims to have videos Epstein made of his friends having sex with minors, and that the videos are stashed somewhere in Europe.

Eventually, she was confronted by concerned parents and asked to leave as she did not have a child involved in the show.\n</blockquote><p>\n\tIt's not that she snuck into the dance recital. It's not that parents confronted Kayla and told them to leave. It's that the incident took place in 2021... and we're only hearing about it now. The initial video that turned Kayla into the social media content ing\u00e9nue her beautiful and brave self has become <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-ontario\" target=\"_blank\">didn't go viral until September of 2022</a>.

That wasn't redpilling enough, so \"Kayla\" was born.\n</p><blockquote>\n\tHe's now upping the ante to exploit the very clown world the school and society itself has created. His long game is most likely to get fired, then sue for discrimination.\n</blockquote><p>The fact that America didn't learn of this Canadian import for a year is questionable. We might be a far superior country, but we all share the same internet. If Kayla is a based dude playing the long con, hats off to him(?). Though the only thing left would be for Kayla to pose in a bikini.</p><p>If not, then the Canadian public school system manages to be worse than what we have in America.
