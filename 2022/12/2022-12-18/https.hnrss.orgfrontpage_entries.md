## Ask HN: Anyone tired of everything being a subscription now?

<p>Not newspapers or media services (though those can be annoying too), but products in general? It feels like it's getting harder and harder to just buy something in the tech world, especially when it comes to running programs on my home computer. Want a password manager? It's a SaaS now. Note taking app? SaaS. Image editor or office suite? SaaS (thanks Adobe...)<p>This is especially annoying given I generally refuse to rent anything in life, and will go out of my way to buy something upfront simply so there's no risk of losing it if finances get worse in future (or the wrong billionaire buys the company). Yet it seems like it's getting harder to do so, especially when open source products don't exist for that domain.<p>So yeah, why is that? And is anyone else tired of the constant barrage of subscriptions for things that should be one off purchases?</p>

## Launch HN: Slauth.io (YC S22) – IAM Policy Auto-Generation

<p>Hey HN, we are Daniel and Tal, Co-founders of Slauth.io (https://www.slauth.io). Slauth auto-generates IAM policies in order to save engineering time and make your policies more secure.<p>If you're an engineer, you probably know how tedious and error-prone it can be to manually write IAM policies. We surveyed over 70 engineers and found out that a majority are using or have used wildcards (*) in order to quickly write IAM policies.<p>By using client-side monitoring or via a proxy, Slauth.io observes all of the API activity and generates a policy based on functionality and least privileges.<p>Once deployed in a remote environment, or run locally, you will need to run an end-to-end test using a wildcard policy. Slauth will observe the activity, apply its logic based on large amounts of behavioral patterns of the service you deploy, and create a high quality IAM policy.<p>The IAM policy will be presented through the Slauth Dashboard where it can be copy/pasted or as a pull-request into your Git repository ready to be reviewed. Integrations with IaC services such as Terraform are also available.<p>Our objective is to automate manual error-prone IAM policy writing in order to increase engineering velocity, reduce friction and harden security.<p>Would love your feedback on the value proposition and if you would use the AWS SDK or Slauth proxy for onboarding.<p>Feel free to also sign up for Beta usage! https://www.slauth.io</p>

<p>Hi HN,<p>I've seen a few posts encouraging people to start blogging or collect their TILs in the form of a blog. I find this to be a great idea, but if it's meant to be public, how would you approach the sharing of this information?<p>I don't love the idea of spamming social media with links just to get people to discover your blog, but maybe that's the best approach.<p>The other option I guess is to just post and let it be discovered, but would that ever happen organically in today's internet?<p>From the other end, as a reader, how do you keep track of interesting blogs? Is RSS still being used? Personally I've realized I read blog posts shared on social media or here on HN, which comes back to as a blogger you might have to spam your links to get traffic.</p>

## Tell HN: Musk's aircraft are not using PIA transponder codes
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037780](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037780)

<p>Musk, and many of those defending him, keep claiming[0] that his aircraft are part of the FAA's Privacy ICAO aircraft address (PIA) program[1]. And that therefore ElonJet or anyone else tracking them is doing more than just republishing public information because you have to first deobfuscate the PIA code.<p>It's false: None of the aircraft Musk has been using are currently using PIA transponder codes or have been recently, and you can verify that for yourself.<p>What PIA does is assign you a fresh non-traceable ICAO hex code every 60 days for each aircraft in the program. You are then responsible for keying that code into your aircraft's transponder each time you get a new one. If you don't change the transponder code there's no additional privacy, as the transponder broadcasts its original identity.<p>This is what an aircraft in the PIA program looks like on ADSB Exchange: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a0fe01<p>Note the 'PIA' flag and lack of additional information that would normally be pulled from the registry. If you convert that to the registration using an online lookup tool[2] you get N163NB, a fake record.[3]<p>Musk uses three jets, N628TS, N272BG, and N502SX. None are using PIA codes and all are easily visible on ADSB Exchange and most importantly have are still using their ICAO hex codes that are listed publicly along with ownership information on the FAA registry.<p>In fact, N628TS is airborne over the Middle East right now using its original assigned ICAO hex code of A835AF, not a PIA code.<p>Perhaps his aircraft have used PIA codes in the past, but they're not using them now. Here's Aric Toler of Bellingcat making the same point: https://twitter.com/AricToler/status/1603802439232241665<p>In our discussions on HN we should at least be able to agree on basic facts like these, and avoid repeating the claims made by those with an interest in confusing the issue.<p>N628TS:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a835af<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=628TS<p>N272BG:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a2ae0a<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=272BG<p>N502SX:<p>https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a64304<p>https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=502SX<p>[0] https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603803508087537665<p>[1] https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/equipadsb/privacy<p>[2] http://www.avionictools.com/icao.php<p>[3] https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=163NB</p>

<p>I'm starting to work with C and would like to build a webserver. I've found a few interesting writeups but would love to hear from the community.<p>What's your favorite book/post/lecture/whatever? I'd also be interested in opinionated writeups/positions.</p>

## Show HN: I built a Hacker News userscript to make this site more legible

<p>My personal itch to scratch just recently has been the umpteen formatting foibles of HackerNews. So, in the spirit of making the web more personal again, I knocked up a TamperMonkey userscript to fix up the worst of my personal bugbears.<p>This isn't an attempt at a complete rebrand/redesign of the site, instead it's just fixing up what I think are the biggest design/readability issues whilst trying to remain true to the site's existing aesthetic.<p>Key features:<p><pre><code>  * Base font size increased
  * A little more room around headings
  * Top menu bar is full-width and with a little more padding
  * Downvoted comments no longer faint hard-to-read grey. Instead they're rendered with a light gray background and in a smaller font size.
  * Comments have a more readable max line length
  * Quotes are parsed and transformed to look like genuine quotes. I.e. any p or span that starts with '>' is transformed and rendered with a light orange background and in italics.
  * The 'Add comment' box on items is hidden by default. (Surely you'd want to read all the comments first before leaping in with your own 2p's worth!?)
</code></pre>

## Don't Use StripE
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035581](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34035581)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>I used Stripe for about 2 years to run a fashion brand in the uk. In the case of my business, I never had an issue processing my small payments for dresses, ranging from a couple hundred dollars up to $1000. All of a sudden, we start getting attention we get payments of  $3300 and more. We had around 50000$ dollars on stripe.  Stripe flagged the account and is now holding the money from me for "at least 120 days"<p>It is one thing to say this is a red flag, fine... I hear you... no problem. a transaction multiple times the size... sure. I get it. However, A normal payment processor would then query you for documents authorizing the charge, bank statements, financial statements, some sort of procedure to remedy the issue. Stripe provides NO SUCH METHOD TO RESOLVE these issues.<p>There are reports of Stripe continuing to add "30 days" to the reserve hold past the initial 120 days, indefinitely. Stripe is taking advantage of a lack of regulation in this space to steal small merchant's large transactions. They see a big, outlier transaction and lick their chops, hiding behind KYC and "Fraud prevention" To hold your money indefinitely.<p>You cannot call Stripe. They do not have a phone number. Their support page on their website has Phone call and messaging grayed out. You can only email. If you email, you get robots. Even in the same email thread, a different "agent" (with a different name and everything) answers each time with not prior knowledge of your history. There are no ticket numbers to your support request; nothing tracking it. The robots respond with what is quite obviously a template response.<p>If you do a little bit of research about this topic, you immediately see this is a prevailing issue. Reports of Stripe taking up to $31,000 are all over the internet! Again, Stripe gives no manner to remedy this. There is NO ONE you can call. NO ONE you can talk to. More disconcerting, it seems that anyone who posts about this issue on reddit gets downvoted and teamed up against by established Reddit accounts, that I have to imagine are owned by Stripe. These account have some established reddit history on them, mainly talking about coding in PERL. It's a little sus.<p>In my case, I sent my EIN letter, Sales Tax Receipt, Articles of Org, Statement of Trade Name, Certificate of Good Standing, Bank Statements, Website links, Signed transaction receipts, and anything I could think of to Stripe to review. I just received robot-responses.<p>I challenge anyone here to connect me to a human being at Stripe that can tell me how to resolve the issue. It can't be done. This is a big problem and should be brought to the attention of small business owners, and regulators!<p>TL;DR: Stripe is a faceless enterprise with no humans you can talk to, no publicly listed phone number, and will allow your small account to operate just fine for a while. As soon as they see that you are growing (and thus your chances of leaving Stripe for a larger, more favorable processor) they will Freeze your account, disallow you to issue refunds, and hold your money indefinitely. You've been warned!!!</p>
