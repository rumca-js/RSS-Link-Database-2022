On Oct. 14th, 2022, a Chinese high school student disappeared without a trace from a gated middle school. This sparked national concern and panic among many parents in China. 

On the evening of October 14th, 2022, Hu Xinyu left the dorm for his evening reading class. He vanished on his way and at a distance of fewer than 100 meters. The distance from the dormitory to the school building is about 100 meters, and there is a section of more than 10 meters that the surveillance camera doesnâ€™t cover. The school has no explanation for why this distance is set as a blind spot for surveillance. When Hu Xinyu disappeared, he only had a recorder on him. His phone, watch, ID card, and cash were left in the dorm.
