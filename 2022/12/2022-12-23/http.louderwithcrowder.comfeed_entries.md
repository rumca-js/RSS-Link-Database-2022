But there is something endearing about this. The mother was teaching her daughter a lesson. Also, had I thought too, I totally would have done this to my little sister back in the day.</p><p>Both sisters wanted the stuffed animal. One convinced the other to climb into the claw machine to take one. Problem: she did not have an exit strategy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>The incident happened in Australia, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/quarantine-camp-26-year-old" target="_blank">where they know a thing or two about being held against your will</a>. The mum (that's what they call "moms" over there) was shocked, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/21/girl-gets-trapped-in-claw-machine-after-trying-to-steal-teddy-bears/" target="_blank">but couldn't stop laughing</a>.</p><blockquote>The girls were playing outside and the next minute my twin daughters ran inside and said ‘mum, Poppy’s stuck in the vending machine.</blockquote><p>It all reminds me of my favorite video this year.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is my new favorite video on the internet… <a href="https://t.co/V8AzN13QTf">pic.twitter.com/V8AzN13QTf</a><br />— Brodigan Appreciation Society (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1560059415033782273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The girl, Poppy, was able to escape after her mum convinced her to sit down so she could be yanked through the opening she crawled in. No, she did not leave with a stuffed animal. Mum made sure Poppy learned her lesson that stealing is a crime and crime does not pay.</p><p>Unless, of course, you live in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/flash-mob-los-angeles" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-wedding-photographer" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/michael-rapaport-shoplifter" target="_blank">New York City</a>. Crime has been very lucrative there in 2022.</p><p><p>

It's the Internet. But it's an accurate quote and one MMA fighter Mike Jackson learned the hard way when he met fellow fighter Jake Shields.</p><p>To set the stage, the 31-9-1 Shields has gotten political over the years. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mma-fighter-jake-shields-tries-reasoning-protesters" target="_blank">It started in 2017</a> when he saved a man's life from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-friendly-texas-full" target="_blank">Antifa thugs</a> in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uc-berkeley-refuses-ben-shapiro" target="_blank">Berkley</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The aftermath of me helping a guy after being jumped by thugs.

The two finally met at the UFC Performance Institute. Jackson is the guy with his back on the ground screaming "get him off of me."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Finally ran into the bitch Mike Jackson <br /><br />He quickly discovered the difference between calling people Nazis In person vs on Twitter <br /><br />This racist is lucky so many people were there to save his pathetic racist ass <a href="https://t.co/90luT0YjfG">pic.twitter.com/90luT0YjfG</a><br />— Jake Shields (@jakeshieldsajj) <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeshieldsajj/status/1603834472540934144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Shields tells <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2022/12/mma-news-jake-shields-responds-to-mike-jackson-lies-claims-of-racism-after-ufc-pi-altercation" target="_blank">MMA Junkie</a> that when he saw Jackson at the PI he reminded him, ‘You said you would fight me when you saw me, that I was too scared of you in my white fragility."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"I didn't punch him because, you know, you punch men.

## Watch: Grinch 'prank' goes horribly wrong when little kid starts throwing punches to save his presents

In the olden times, our fathers wouldn't show emotion or tell us that they loved us. In 2022, dads get one of their buddies to dress like the Grinch and steal their kids' presents, hoping their kid's emotional and traumatic response will trend on social media. </p><p>This little kid wasn't having it and was going to stop the Grinch by any means necessary.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">lil bro wasn't with it 😂 <a href="https://t.co/FokWVkhxlE">pic.twitter.com/FokWVkhxlE</a><br />— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyLoud/status/1602415951588298756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Shout out to Little Man. It starts with him staring at his mother with her smartphone out (I'm guessing it was the mom since the dad was in the background) and wondering "are you going to do something, or do I have to handle business?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6e85f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32389256&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Once the kid realized his mother wasn't going to protect her children, it was on sight. Little Man didn't even think. He ran right to the Grinch and just started dropping bombs. No one -- and Little Man means NO ONE - was going to waltz into his home and steal his presents. He had no (fudges) to give. I'm surprised he didn't chase the Grinch out of the house. This video needed doorbell camera footage of Little Man grabbing a tree branch and whacking the intruder with it.</p><p>A decent adult would have recognized that this prank has gone horribly wrong. The Grinch should have seen that his plan was foiled, and let the kid feel like he saved the day. Instead, Little Man's dad held him back while the Grinch stole his toys. Gotta get those TikTok clicks.</p><p>At what point we went from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-claus-car-thief-supplex" target="_blank">dressing up as Santa</a> (and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-claus-dealer-hammer" target="_blank">fighting crime as Santa</a>) to dressing up like the Grinch, I'm not quite sure. There has been a lot about 2022 that makes little sense to me.</p><p><p>
