Naturally, that meant sequel-time, and FAST. Okay maybe not fast. Maybe not even slow-paced. Maybe THIRTEEN YEARS LATER James Cameron has brought us back to the world of Pandora, along with all the characters whose names we definitely remember. \n\nAvatar: The Way Of Water definitely raises some questions. Like why spend so much money bringing back Colonel Quarritch to life, the guy who famously failed the last time he attempted something similar to this mission? Why does Jake suddenly decide that it\u2019s suddenly time to run away after literally heading into battle regularly? Where did all the ocean people go in the third act? How many decades until the next movie?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Avatar: The Way Of Water.\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nShe-Hulk Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDBd16pBLg\n\nMorbius Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5I1WWeFQg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBPO76TGUQ", "date_published": "2022-12-23 20:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
