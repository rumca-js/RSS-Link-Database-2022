From China

Lots of people have colds
 
Chengdu

Monday the 5th of December 2022, local government loosened all covid restrictions

By the 12th, almost everyone I know has covid

Severe stigma associated with the virus

About 80% have symptoms

20% asymptomatic

Symptoms

Headache (with brain fog)

Lack of energy/fatigue

Muscle pain

Body pains

(Seem universal)

Also

Dry throat

Slight cough

Runny nose (usually light)

Nausea

Insomnia

Diarrhoea 

Increased appetite in some

Very little testing going on
Few government testing centres

Many determined to know, long queues

People still think the virus is very dangerous

Getting negative results (despite being symptomatic)

Avoid panic

Avoid shutdowns

Promote natural immunity

UK cements 10-year-partnership with Moderna in major boost for vaccines and research

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-cements-10-year-partnership-with-moderna-in-major-boost-for-vaccines-and-research

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-to-open-vaccine-research-and-manufacturing-centre-in-uk

Moderna to invest in mRNA research and development (R&D) in the UK,

and build a state-of-the-art vaccine manufacturing centre,

with the ability to produce up to 250 million vaccines a year

Suggested advantages

NHS patients will have access to a UK-made supply of COVID-19 jabs,

as well as cutting-edge vaccines developed for other respiratory diseases, 

such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

Create more than 150 jobs

Further future-proof the UK against potential pandemics, 

speedy access to the latest advancements in vaccine technology

UK cements its status as a life sciences superpower.

The partnership with Moderna

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) working with Moderna,

to ensure early vaccine development, 

supporting the G7 mission to get from variant to vaccine in 100 days.

NHS patients access to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines,

that can protect against multiple variants. 

This is the finalisation of the partnership, 
led by the Vaccine Taskforce.

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Steve Barclay

It is vital we invest in fighting future variants of this disease, (covid),

as well as other deadly viruses that are circulating, 

such as seasonal flu and RSV, 

and this partnership with Moderna will also strengthen our ability to respond to any future pandemics.

We are also told

Moderna worked closely with the Vaccine Taskforce during the pandemic, 

The company has now committed to invest substantial funding in UK-based research and development activities,

over a 10-year period. 

Perhaps, most concerning of all

This will include running a significant number of clinical trials in the UK

and it has also pledged to fund grants for UK universities, 

including PhD places and research programmes.

Not mentioned in press release

Full explanation as to why the focus is exclusively on mRNA vaccines, rather than tired and tested traditional vaccines.

Why the UK government needs Moderna?

The partnership will issue guarantees that the funding will in no way influence the agenda of the employed scientists.

A graduate student will be awarded his or her PhD, based purely on the quality of the research.

There will be no sanction of scientists that offer alternative views to the prevailing narrative.

Scientists will not be threatened or cajoled in any way.

Within reason, scientists will be able to choose what they want to research, not be ordered into proving a desired concept.

Science will not be used to provide evidence for a development that looks profitable.

Science and medicine will never be subjugated to commercial interests.

There will be independent oversight of the partnership.

If promising none mRNA vaccine looks interesting this will not squashed.

Extensive studies will be carried out on systemic distribution of the mRNA

All organs will be examined for damage caused by systemic distribution of mRNA

Brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen.

Adverse effects on physiological systems will be closely monitored
All results will be published, whether negative or positive.

There will be no publication bias, (where favourable results are published and publicised, while less favourable results are squashed).

Research reports will not be ghost written by Moderna or representatives of the partnership.

The peer review process will have guaranteed anonymity, i.e. will be blind.

Full, anonymised source data will be in the public domain for independent analysis.

All adverse events will be published in full, combined with all relevant pathophysiological data, blood results, clinical examinations, investigation results, histology.

All recruits to clinical trials will receive full information disclosure, so they can give full informed consent before agreeing to be a trial participant.

Full accounts, including commercial profits will be placed into the public domain, at least every year.

Studies on intramuscular injection technique to prevent systemic administration.

Timetable

Construction is expected to commence in early 2023, 

with the first mRNA vaccine expected to be produced in the UK in 2025.

Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA
I’m delighted that… 

Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna
Our new state-of-the-art facility will bring mRNA manufacturing to UK shores, 
Ect. Ect.
