## London Irish’s Tom Pearson helps stun leaders Saracens in feisty clash

<ul><li>London Irish 29-20 Saracens</li><li>Both sides have a man sent off in the first half</li></ul><p>London Irish’s bright young things dazzled in front of the watching Steve Borthwick to seal a well-deserved victory and condemn top-of-the-table Saracens to a first Premiership defeat of the season. Chandler Cunningham-South sealed the win with a late try, teed up by the stand-out performer of the night in Tom Pearson, while it was Ollie Hassell-Collins who got the ball rolling for the Exiles. Borthwick will have left with food for thought as a result.</p><p>Saracens, for their part, were out of kilter. They were frustrated by London Irish’s defence and took it out on the referee Matthew Carley too often. Both sides were shown red cards for high tackles in the first half – Adam Coleman for Irish, Ben Earl for Saracens – but for the best part of 10 minutes in the second, the Exiles were down to 12 men after two more yellows. Saracens rarely looked like scoring in that period – too frenetic in the face of Irish’s resilience – and accordingly, lost their nine-match winning run in the competition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/23/london-irishs-tom-pearson-helps-stun-leaders-saracens-in-feisty-clash">Continue reading...</a>

## In Borthwick has the RFU found England’s Gareth Southgate or Steve McClaren? | Gerard Meagher

<p>RFU chiefs will hope Borthwick brings joy back for players and fans as they cross their fingers he gets a waistcoat for Christmas</p><p>England have recently parted company with their first foreign super coach – someone arguably indulged too long and with a tendency to cause his employers unwanted headlines. His replacement is English, less colourful, earnest to a fault and has been on the coaching staff before. Someone who as a coach – in the truest sense of the world – is considered to be at the forefront of the game. Most recently, in their first major job as a No 1, he led his club to a domestic trophy and a European final. Yet there are questions as to whether he has the charisma, the force of personality, for the very top job. The year is 2006 and Steve McClaren has just been unveiled as England manager.</p><p>The point to be made here is that, while there is a perception among Rugby Football Union executives that by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/19/steve-borthwick-england-rugby-union-head-coach-replace-eddie-jones">appointing Steve Borthwick as England head coach</a> they have found their Gareth Southgate, history comes with a stark warning. Context is, of course, everything. Sven Goran Eriksson’s departure was pre-planned, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/eddie-jones-sacked-as-england-rugby-union-head-coach">unlike that of Eddie Jones</a>, and McClaren had the unenviable task of taking a job that had already been offered elsewhere. The RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has made clear that the “Second Choice Steve” moniker does not apply to Borthwick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/23/in-borthwick-has-the-rfu-found-englands-gareth-southgate-or-its-steve-mcclaren">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The producer made scores of hits, paved the way for disco and recorded big cats for Dionne Warwick. He was like no other</p><p>Thom Bell, along with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, was part of the holy trinity of Philly soul – the lustrous, aspirational sound that bossed the US R&amp;B charts between the peaks of Motown in the 60s and disco in the late 70s. Bell was a supremely confident, classically trained songwriter and arranger who introduced the celeste, the french horn and the harpsichord to soul music. The results were classicssuch as Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time) for the Delfonics, Back Stabbers for the O’Jays and You Make Me Feel Brand New by the Stylistics.</p><p>He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but his parents moved to Philadelphia when he was very young. His upbringing was solidly middle-class and he was playing piano from the age of four. By the time Bell was nine he could also play drums and flugelhorn. Rock’n’roll largely passed him by; instead, he idolised Burt Bacharach and the writer and arranger Teddy Randazzo. The local Cameo-Parkway label gave Bell his first employment as an arranger in 1965, and in no time his sound became instantly recognisable. “Nobody else is in my brain but me,” he told me. “Which is why some of the things I think about are crazy – I hear oboes and bassoons. An arranger told me: ‘Thom Bell, Black people don’t listen to that.’ I said: Why limit yourself to Black people? I make music for people. I wouldn’t care if they had a horn in their head.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/23/bob-stanley-thom-bell-philly-soul">Continue reading...</a>

It thrilled us both.</p><p>He and my grandmother had been trying to replace his previous hearing aid for more than a month but confusing instructions, impatient explanations and faulty hardware meant they’d almost given up.

<p>Every bit as ritzy as sequins, dark velvet is posh but unfussy – the perfect outfit for wrapping presents and drinking mulled wine</p><p>Tomorrow, Christmas Eve, is the best day of the year. Fact. No need to waste your breath arguing, since I am quite certain I am right, thank you very much. The 24th of December is infinitely superior to the 25th. Indeed, the moment you realise this is the moment you become an adult.</p><p>Christmas Eve feels as if it is everyone’s birthday. The magic of Christmas is all in the promise. Presents keeping their secrets under the tree, mistletoe poised to be kissed beneath. A fridge that is groaning with food for Christmas, none of which you are actually allowed to eat yet. If Christmas was a song, tomorrow would be the bridge and Christmas Day would be the final refrain of the chorus when you’re thinking about what to play next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/23/christmas-eve-has-a-dusting-of-magic-and-it-calls-for-plush-velvet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On site visits, the PM and ministers like to dress up as workers, but their only actual power is to make everything worse</p><p>Christmas week brings an exciting labour market win for Rishi Sunak, as the prime minister finally manages to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/22/sir-laurie-magnus-named-rishi-sunak-independent-adviser-ministers-interests">appoint an ethics adviser</a>. For the past few months, this empty role has begun to look like one of the jobs that British people no longer seem minded to do, like fruit picking or being Nigel Farage’s wife. As part of Sunak’s commitment to being the change he wants to see, his ethics guy is Sir Laurie Magnus, a former investment banker who won’t have the power to launch his own investigations. Maybe this is Sunak’s version of a terrible cracker joke.</p><p>A full 18 hours into his job, Magnus has yet to stage a wildcat strike, which feels like a rare industrial relations success for the prime minister. For those struggling to keep track of who else is on strike, a useful rule of thumb is that if a secretary of state has dressed up as one on a visit this year, they are now taking industrial action.</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/23/rishi-sunak-government-prime-minister">Continue reading...</a>

But it did feel like that.”</p><p>Despite having had nothing to do with the business side of the club, he also found it hard not to blame himself for the plight of his fellow staff and players after the club was formally placed into administration with debts totalling £95 million. “I was the head coach.

<p>George Cohen, who has died aged 83, was perhaps the least illustrious member of England’s most glorious team, but his value was nevertheless clear</p><p>At the end of the 1962-63 season George Cohen was selected for a short England Under-23 tour of eastern Europe. When it ended he had played eight out of 21 Under-23 fixtures over nearly four years, never quite establishing his place in the side, and was about to turn 24. It was, he concluded, the end of his international career. “That’s me, finished,” he announced. Within a year he was in the senior side.</p><p>“How wrong he was,” Alf Ramsey later said of the defender, who has died aged 83. “He had all the qualities required of an international player, particularly in defence. He was a serious-minded young man, dedicated to his task. Playing against him must have been a very frustrating experience.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/23/george-cohen-englands-idiosyncratic-world-cup-winning-fitness-fanatic">Continue reading...</a>

Because of my terrible hunched posture I’m always looking for an opportunity to lie down and alleviate the pain in my back. Because of my great love of trees I am always looking for an opportunity to lie down in a woodland. And because we lost a beloved cousin tragically young this summer, I was also looking for opportunities to be quiet and think of him and have a little cry. This was my moment.</p><p>We recently welcomed a puppy to our family, and he has taken a special liking to me because I’m the person who walks him and feeds him; I’m not really a dog person, so he’s made it his personal mission to convert me. I guess it’s working, I love him in a sort of gently revelatory, deeply trying, must-learn-to-be-patient way. He joined me in the ancient green cavern, whining. I don’t like to have my face licked when I’m having a reflective moment. His name is Happy, so if you were passing the lime coppice you would have heard me saying, “No Happy. Fuck’s sake, Happy. Happy, please leave me alone for two seconds.”</p><p>Max Porter’s new novel, Shy, is out next year</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/23/max-porter-2000-year-old-small-leaved-lime-coppice-peace-sacred">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brian Cox, Nicola Coughlan and Daniel Kaluuya are among the all-star cast of this slick and sumptuous take on a classic</p><p>“Please Sir, I want some more” is among the most famous lines in English literature, and its power is undiminished in this new recording of Oliver Twist featuring an all-star cast and produced by Sam Mendes. It begins as a baby is born in a workhouse to an unmarried woman who dies shortly after, leaving the orphaned child to be named by Mr Bumble (Adeel Akhtar).</p><p>Nine years later, and we find Oliver (Emilio Villa-Muhammad) being goaded by the other orphans to ask for a second helping of gruel on his birthday. His request is deemed so shocking that he is cast out and sent to live with a local undertaker, who makes him sleep among the coffins and gives him the dog’s leftovers for his supper. Oliver runs away, walking 70 miles to London, though when he arrives his problems continue as he falls in with a gang of thieves, led by the Artful Dodger (Elijah Wolf).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/23/oliver-twist-by-charles-dickens-audiobook-review-a-mouthwatering-adaptation">Continue reading...</a>

This year, judgment is likely to fall on where you stand in relation to the most popular new school of parenting.</p><p>It’s called “gentle parenting” or “child-centred parenting” or, sometimes, “child-led parenting”, and in outline it doesn’t sound bad. Where I live in New York, it’s the dominant approach among parents of young children, where the air is busy with identifiable phrases. “You seem to be frustrated, why is that?” says a mother to her toddler, as he screams and refuses to leave the playground. Or “I hear that you’re hurting right now”, delivered to a bellowing child who just kicked another child’s shin. The harshest line you’ll hear in this vein is a softly intoned: “That’s not OK.”</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist based in New York</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/23/child-centred-parenting-shouting-validation-school">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In looking to connect with my father, I asked him about the NBA team he loved. The hope that one day the Knicks – and in a way us – would see better days is what kept me alive</p><p>When the New York Knicks made history in 1999, becoming the first No 8 seed to reach the NBA finals, I was poolside, playing with Barbies with my female cousins. Even at 14, I was a rebellious punk, always going against the grain of expectations. Back then, I had a vague understanding of gender norms. I knew I <em>should </em>have been inside the pool’s meager employee’s building, where my dad and uncles huddled around a small TV, fidgeting with the antenna to watch the Knicks buck the odds. The moment was special to my dad, a native New Yorker. Following a lockout that lasted until mid-January of that season, the Knicks had needed to win six of their last eight regular-season games just to sneak into the playoffs as the eighth and final seed. It was equally <em>not</em> special to me, who just wanted to be the opposite of everything going on in front of that game.</p><p>The Knicks would win that game by eight points and when they did, I remember hearing my Mexican-American father and <em>tios</em> scream at the top of their lungs. It was the loudest I had ever heard my dad’s voice. He was usually a quiet, subtle man. But on that hot evening in June, he stood in damp swim trunks – double–fisting Modelos, his arms around my uncles, screaming, crying, salivating – at his Knicks returning to the finals for the first time since 1994.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/23/new-york-knicks-saved-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Thousand8/BxB Entertainment)<br /></strong>Two rappers born 10 years apart mesh well, swapping brooding verses on navigating a bruising industry</p><p>In the past few years, artists such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/08/fredo-independence-day-review-rap">Fredo</a>, Meekz and <a href="https://www.mixtapemadness.com/blog/interviews/in-talks-with-country-dons-we-havent-followed-one-genre-on-the-mixtape">Country Dons</a> have all netted large fanbases with a blend of gritty road rap and modern trap. Really, they’re treading a path first worn by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPUsMXXQcqX3fHnrHkZRG-w">Blade Brown</a>, whose late-00s link-ups with Giggs and revered run of Bags &amp; Boxes<em> </em>mixtapes laid down a template for the UK’s own strain of gangsta rap. On Joints, his new mixtape with fellow south Londoner K-Trap, he sets the record straight: “Think you’ve tapped into the streets, but we a little closer,” he rumbles on La Cosa Nostra.</p><p>K-Trap made his name, balaclava-clad, in the drill scene, but has since settled into slower tempos that give his snippy delivery space to breathe, and he’s Blade’s newest sparring partner. They make for an inspired intergenerational pairing, swapping brooding verses over bruising kick drums. Their flows sit like sides of the same crisp £50 note: K-Trap’s rising inflections dovetail with Blade’s low growl, his delivery brimming with the contentedness of someone who’s just devoured a particularly rich meal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/23/k-trap-and-blade-brown-joints-review-inspired-pairing-moves-the-message-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A six-week World Cup break has been rather odd but it seems Arsenal are top, Newcastle third and Everton are still in crisis</p><p>This season’s Premier League. Remember it? It kicked off back in August before taking a six-week hiatus so we could all enjoy the first ever winter World Cup. Well, it’s back on Boxing Day, so now seems as good as time as any to provide a quick primer for readers who, like this column, may have been so preoccupied by events in Doha they’ve been being paying scant attention to goings on closer to home.</p><p>Consider it born out of our surprise upon discovering that Liverpool winger Luis Díaz could be out for the rest of the season with the recurrence of a knee injury his manager Jürgen Klopp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/liverpool-expect-luis-diaz-out-until-march-injury-training">has described as</a> a “proper smash in the face”.

<p>It may have massive jaws, but the gulper eel’s ultra-black skin ensures it remains well hidden in the depths of the ocean</p><p>Compared with the enormous size of their jaws, gulper eels (<em>Eurypharynx pelecanoides</em>), also known as pelican eels, have one of the tiniest skulls of any animal. The enormous jaws allow them to swallow whatever prey they happen upon in the vast space of the deep sea, where food is hard to come by.</p><p>“The upper and lower jaw are so big that when its mouth is closed and folded up it’s almost half the length of its body,” says Yi-Kai Tea, a Chadwick Biodiversity Fellow at the Australian Museum in Sydney. “The head is right at the tip.” <br /><br />The metre-long gulper eels live at depths of more than 7km under the surface, although typically they are found in the midnight zone at about 1,000 metres. Their jaws unfold to immense dimensions, like an umbrella.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/23/discovered-in-the-deep-the-jaw-dropping-gulper-eel-and-its-super-stretchy-skin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marine curiosities and the author’s own queer coming-of-age tale are intertwined in these evocative essays</p><p>For the deep sea octopus, motherhood heralds a lengthy and ultimately lethal hunger strike. She’ll breed just once, and her eggs will require much of the energy she has slowly acquired during her long life in order to survive. She guards them until they hatch and won’t allow trivial matters like eating to distract her from her duty. Development is slow in the frigid depths, and by the time her babies swim free, four and a half hungry years have passed. The skin sagging around her shrunken frame has slowly lost all pigment, leaving her a ghostly white facsimile of her former hunting self, ready to die.</p><p>Sabrina Imbler, who uses they/them pronouns, lures us into the life of this eight-limbed underwater martyr with infectious curiosity. Then they do something quite different, telling us about their own starving mother, and the eating disorder they inherited from her. The entwined storylines mirror one another: we join the young Imbler being escorted to a weight-loss clinic by their mother, and in the next paragraph the deep sea octopus refuses to be force-fed by a robot submarine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/23/my-life-in-sea-creatures-by-sabrina-imbler-review-an-exquisite-science-memoir-hybrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cellists Lloyd Webber, 71, and Cheng, 48, met while he was on tour in New Zealand. She eventually moved to the UK, where the couple now live. They married in 2009</p><p>It wasn’t until the third time Julian Lloyd Webber and Jiaxin Cheng met that the idea of a romantic relationship seemed a possibility. The first time, in 2000, Julian, the celebrated cellist, was on tour in New Zealand, and Jiaxin was one of a number of music students invited to hear him rehearse. Born in China, Jiaxin had graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and was doing a master’s degree at Auckland University. “Our teacher took us backstage to say hello,” she says.</p><p>Julian got her email address, and contacted her two years later when he was on tour in the country again to ask if she was still in New Zealand, adding that he might need her technical help with a concert that was going to be broadcast. By then, Jiaxin had graduated and was playing in the Auckland Philharmonia and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. “At rehearsal, the sound wasn’t good and I asked Jiaxin if she could come and listen,” says Julian. “Being a cellist herself, she was very helpful, and I was able to get a good recording.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/23/how-julian-lloyd-webber-met-jiaxin-cheng-i-said-would-you-consider-trying-life-in-england">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Scottish director discusses the impact and autobiography of her debut film, about a father (Paul Mescal) and daughter (Frankie Corio) on holiday in the late 1990s</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/film/2022/dec/23/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-1-aftersun">Peter Bradshaw on why Aftersun is the best film of the year</a></p><p><strong>Why do you think the film has had such an impact on people?<br /></strong>I don’t know. Cannes [where the film premiered] was such a shock. The response was wholly unexpected, both for what it was and because I had never considered what it might be. Which is a naivete I will only have this once and feel so grateful for. We had just been rushing to get to the finish line. We’d spoken a lot in the edit room about the film’s legibility and how it might connect with audiences, but without any thought to what that meant. We never considered what the critical response would be. I don’t think we ever thought very many people would see the film, which was a reasonable expectation.</p><p><strong>Does it speak to an audience hunger for films that aren’t too</strong><strong> prescriptive?<br /></strong>That would be nice if that were true. One thing that struck me was the second we finished screening in Cannes, this young man came up to me and shared his own and his mother’s experience with depression. And it was so striking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/23/charlotte-wells-on-aftersun-the-guardians-best-film-of-the-year-the-grief-expressed-is-mine">Continue reading...</a>
