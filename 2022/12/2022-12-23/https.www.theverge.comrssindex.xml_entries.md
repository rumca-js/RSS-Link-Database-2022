  <p id="NJNfrY">Numerous users have reported experiencing an odd glitch in the Google Calendar mobile app over the past few days. The app appears to be creating random, nonexistent all-day events based on the content of users’ Gmail messages. </p>
<p id="K0p5lf"><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/12/23/google-calendar-gmail-events-random/">As <em>9to5Google</em></a><em> </em>(who reported the news earlier today) notes, various sorts of emails including delivery notifications, purchase receipts, and newsletters appear to be showing up as all-day calendar events. Some <em>Verge </em>staffers who use the Google calendar app are experiencing this glitch. “It’s like finding landmines in my calendar,” one writer (whose calendar is screenshotted below) complained.</p>
<p id="mZRHbb">Google has not yet responded to a request for comment. </p>

  <p id="c0k5CV">People who make Yule Log videos — are you okay? I’m worried about you. The standard flame-filled videos of holiday cheer seem a lot darker lately, and while I would love to know why, I’m also just generally concerned for your mental well-being. </p>
<p id="KDlR4u">My first sign that something was wrong was <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81425229">The Witcher: Fireplace</a> on Netflix, which technically came out last year but is understandably getting re-promoted now. It’s got a nice-looking fire crackling away in the Great Hall at Kaer Morhen, but the lightly ominous music lurking in the background killed “the perfect backdrop for a cozy vibe” that Netflix promised. </p>

  <p id="fFykLn">The internet is, in many ways, built on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit">fraudulent measurement</a>. Measuring article and video views keep the wheels of online advertising spinning, while counting likes, faves, etc, constitute an insidious drip of “engagement” that has us all opening apps when we should know better. But some metrics are stupider than others, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/21/23522064/twitter-view-count-roll-out-personal-info"> Twitter’s new public view count for tweets</a> is definitely one of them.</p>
<p id="TzAp2y">Twitter has long counted views for tweets, but previously chose to keep this information tucked away inside its analytics menu: a data-heavy feature beloved only by social media managers and sadists (but I repeat myself). Knowing how many views a tweet got is useful information, sure, but only if you’re running a business or a brand. For the rest...</p>

As noted by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/college-student-who-tracks-elon-musks-jet-is-back-elonjetnextday-2022-12"><em>Insider</em></a>, Jack Sweeney, 20, has created a new account called <a href="https://twitter.com/ElonJetNextDay">@ElonJetNextDay</a> — which now tracks Musk’s private jet with a 24-hour delay to circumvent Twitter policy restrictions.</p>
<p id="BXERtF">Sweeney’s original ElonJet account was suspended from the platform last week following accusations from Musk that it violated Twitter rules by revealing his live location. Twitter updated its policy to forbid publishing a person’s real-time location on the same day it suspended ElonJet. Sweeney said in an interview with <em>Insider</em> that he will be “posting manually”...</p>

  <p id="1ACvkY">The Apple Watch Ultra is a very good smartwatch. It’s got loads of features, very long battery life, a titanium shell, and a distinctive design. You can read all about how good it is in my colleague <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">Victoria Song’s review</a> from earlier this fall. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23512561/apple-watch-ultra-video-review-wearables-smartwatch">feature-length video review</a> we recently published that does a deeper dive into Apple’s unique claims for the Ultra.</p>
<p id="BeaeIe">But as good as the Apple Watch Ultra is, it’s not the Apple Watch for me. I’m not an adventurous athlete and have no aspirations to be, but I am both a smartwatch devotee and an appreciator of fine mechanical watches (that, let’s be real, I won’t ever be able to afford). The Ultra <em>should</em> appeal to me based on those merits — after all, nobody dives with a...</p>

In the 37-page document, which you can read in full below, Microsoft argues its case for why its $68.7 billion acquisition should go through — it also defends its acquisition of Bethesda owner ZeniMax, while admitting that it’s planning to make three future titles from the company exclusive to Xbox and PC.</p>
