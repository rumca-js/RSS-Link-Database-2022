Bell was a supremely confident, classically trained songwriter and arranger who introduced the celeste, the french horn and the harpsichord to soul music. The results were classicssuch as Didn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind This Time) for the Delfonics, Back Stabbers for the O\u2019Jays and You Make Me Feel Brand New by the Stylistics.</p><p>He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but his parents moved to Philadelphia when he was very young. His upbringing was solidly middle-class and he was playing piano from the age of four. By the time Bell was nine he could also play drums and flugelhorn. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll largely passed him by; instead, he idolised Burt Bacharach and the writer and arranger Teddy Randazzo. The local Cameo-Parkway label gave Bell his first employment as an arranger in 1965, and in no time his sound became instantly recognisable. \u201cNobody else is in my brain but me,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhich is why some of the things I think about are crazy \u2013 I hear oboes and bassoons.
