<p>After a long delay, <em>Sports Story </em>is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3Nwb3J0cy1zdG9yeS1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxN2M3MTNjNy0wNDNlLTQxNTEtYjUyNS1kNjBmZDA4MWMwZTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbBH3bwSNkaZtSC3i7ZaWW_UuxtDMebokOZU-Y_v4dZ1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fsports-story-switch%2F">now available</a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nintendo%20switch/"><ins>Nintendo Switch</ins></a>. Fans of <em>Golf Story </em>have been awaiting the follow-up for quite some time. <em>Sports Story</em> was initially supposed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-nintendo-switch-2020-indie-games-axiom-verge-2.html"><ins>arrive on the console in 2020</ins></a>, but as has been the case with so many games over the last few years, it was delayed.</p><p><em>Sports Story </em>features many of the same characters as <em>Golf Story. </em>It follows the events of the previous game and it has a similar blend of sports, role-playing and adventuring. You'll still get to play some golf in this one, and you can partake in tennis, soccer, BMX and (unsurprisingly, given that this is an RPG) fishing. You can also explore dungeons and abandoned ruins or simply hang out at the mall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1c33446cc7cd4be2beb04b03bba04e03"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Prove your athletic prowess in sports of all sorts – Sports Story is out now on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a>! <br /><br />Let the training commence: <a href="https://t.co/UybEUp7QGW">https://t.co/UybEUp7QGW</a><a href="https://t.co/tQELzAJvKv">pic.twitter.com/tQELzAJvKv</a></p>— Nintendo UK (@NintendoUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1606336040750534658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rogue-legacy-2-and-a-little-to-the-left-now-available-nintendo-switch-184247751.html"><ins>said last month</ins></a> that <em>Sports Story</em> would arrive sometime in December, and that held true.

## Apple's 'unprecedented' engineering snafu reportedly spoiled plans for more powerful iPhone 14 Pro chip

Software simulations had suggested it was feasible, and the company moved forward with prototyping. But test hardware drew more power than the engineers had expected, which would have hurt battery life and overheated the device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Because Apple caught the mistakes late in development, it had to scrap the plans for this generation and opt instead for the A16 that shipped this fall. (In Apple’s September keynote, rather than puffing up the new chip’s monumental gains, as it typically does, it only briefly mentioned that the GPU had 50 percent more memory bandwidth.) The report’s sources described the screwup as “unprecedented in the group’s history.”</p><p><em>The Information</em>'s report connects this incident to bigger-picture struggles within the Apple Silicon team. It details the effective but highly demanding leadership under the senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srouji. He runs the group “like a well-oiled machine,” but it’s also struggled with the limits of Moore’s law and a talent exodus to startups and rival chip makers. It allegedly lost the most talent to Nuvia, founded by former Apple chip designer Gerard Williams III — a well-liked leader among Apple’s silicon engineers. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-acquires-chip-firm-nuvia-founded-by-ex-apple-cpu-executives-101434425.html">Qualcomm bought Nuvia</a> in 2021.) The designer who replaced Williams, Mike Filippo, then “clashed with engineers” before leaving to join Microsoft. Apple hasn’t yet replaced him. Additionally, the company reportedly tried to limit the talent exodus by showing presentations to engineers highlighting the riskiness of working for chip startups, warning that most fail.</p>

Normally, Apple sells this version, which includes 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, for $1,199, though we've seen it fall to $1,049 a number of times in recent months. Either way, the M2-powered Air is the top pick in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">our guide to the best laptops</a>, and we gave it a glowing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">review score of 96</a> earlier this year. As an everyday notebook, it gives little to complain about, but note that this entry-level configuration has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23220299/apple-macbook-air-m2-slow-ssd-read-write-speeds-testing-benchmark">slower storage</a> performance than Apple's higher-priced SKUs. Still, if you aren't planning to do more involved work like editing high-resolution videos, this shouldn't be a major hindrance on a day-to-day basis.

This is a decent VA panel with a 4K resolution, but its big selling point is that it can double as a sort of tuner-less smart TV. Since it runs Samsung's Tizen interface, it's able to stream apps like Netflix, HBO Max and the like even when it's not hooked up to a PC. It comes with a remote, webcam, mic and built-in speakers, and it can serve as a SmartThings hub. If you know you'll actually use that smart TV functionality, the M8 is among the most versatile monitors you can buy, even if it's limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks local dimming.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlYMjU4QzJSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YTVjYjJmMi05NzI1LTRjMDItOTBmNi1iNGEzNDYyNWMwOWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfveOfUWNjDf5zzC_YLGXj32g_O6HM1kn-wjLlSZu3zY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09X258C2R" id="55707ba5b28f476dbe0b50fea3508ef7">Buy Samsung Smart Monitor M8 at Amazon - $400</a><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvY29tcHV0aW5nL21vbml0b3JzL3NtYXJ0LW1vbml0b3JzLzMyLW04LTRrLXNtYXJ0LW1vbml0b3ItYW5kLXN0cmVhbWluZy10di1waW5rLWxzMzJibTgwcHVueGdvLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGE1Y2IyZjItOTcyNS00YzAyLTkwZjYtYjRhMzQ2MjVjMDljIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcG-ct7moJaW5dggq7RpnILqgiVX1OYTECHtwO53J_ev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmonitors%2Fsmart-monitors%2F32-m8-4k-smart-monitor-and-streaming-tv-pink-ls32bm80punxgo%2F" id="4dd0dde3d6094b25837272821243dd99">Buy Samsung Smart Monitor M8 at Samsung - $400</a><h2>Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro</h2><figure><img alt="Both the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro feature bright OLED screens.

## Microsoft and Activision Blizzard file responses to the FTC's antitrust lawsuit

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> has filed a formal response to a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit that seeks to block it from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html/"><ins>buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</ins></a>. It pushed back against the agency's claims that the takeover would harm competition in the gaming industry. The company argued that consumers would benefit. "The commission cannot meet its burden of showing that the transaction would leave consumers worse off, because the transaction will allow consumers to play Activision’s games on new platforms and access them in new and more affordable ways," Microsoft wrote.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">The FTC asserted earlier this month</a> that, should the deal close, it "would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business." The agency pointed to Microsoft making some titles from Bethesda (whose parent company ZeniMax <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">it bought last year</a>) exclusive to its own platforms.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the filing, Microsoft acknowledged that it planned to make three future Bethesda titles exclusive to Xbox and PC. The names of those games were redacted, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html/"><em><ins>Starfield</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redfall-gameplay-trailer-xbox-arcane-bethesda-181448121.html/"><em><ins>Redfall</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will only be available on Xbox, PC and Xbox Cloud Gaming, while the FTC claimed <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D09412MicrosoftActivisionAdministrativeComplaintPublicVersionFinal.pdf"><ins>in its complaint</ins></a> that Microsoft plans to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-pc-exclusive-game-pass-hint-phil-spencer-172718058.html/"><em><ins>Elder Scrolls VI</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>an exclusive as well.</p><div id="c2314388e356438daf4e09e094972ade"><p style="margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; display: block;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50LzYxNjA1NjI1NC9NaWNyb3NvZnQtcy1SZXNwb25zZS10by10aGUtRlRDLXMtQW50aXRydXN0LUxhd3N1aXQjZnJvbV9lbWJlZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGY5YzNjNzctZmVjNS00ODFkLTg3NDItZGQ4NDM1MmMwNWI1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAU3HrqCrDmO5zeAXOP5FzvxqSgEztS9Aa3BhZ15t6-vx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F616056254%2FMicrosoft-s-Response-to-the-FTC-s-Antitrust-Lawsuit%23from_embed" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="View Microsoft's Response to the FTC's Antitrust Lawsuit on Scribd">Microsoft's Response to the FTC's Antitrust Lawsuit</a> by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL3VzZXIvNjQ2NjgyNTI2L0tyaXMtSG9sdCNmcm9tX2VtYmVkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZjljM2M3Ny1mZWM1LTQ4MWQtODc0Mi1kZDg0MzUyYzA1YjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaupetxrF34mEP3WO58ZmEStOCesZhkb4Z_QrVC6teZO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F646682526%2FKris-Holt%23from_embed" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="View Kris Holt's profile on Scribd">Kris Holt</a> on Scribd</p></div><p>One of the major sticking points about the deal is the future of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call%20of%20duty/"><ins>Call of Duty</ins></a>. In an attempt to appease regulators, Microsoft has pledged to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-playstation-call-of-duty-ftc-172017050.html"><ins>keep Call of Duty on competitors' platforms</ins></a> for at least 10 years if the acquisition closes, and to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-call-of-duty-nintendo-consoles-053027619.html"><ins>bring the blockbuster franchise to Nintendo consoles</ins></a>. Sony hasn't taken Microsoft up on that deal, however.</p><p>"The acquisition of a single game by the third-place console manufacturer cannot upend a highly competitive industry. That is particularly so when the manufacturer has made clear it will not withhold the game," Microsoft wrote. "The fact that Xbox’s dominant competitor has thus far refused to accept Xbox’s proposal does not justify blocking a transaction that will benefit consumers."</p><p>Microsoft and Activision Blizzard both claim that keeping Call of Duty away from other platforms wouldn't make sense. Activision said in its own filing that making the franchise exclusive "would be disastrous for Xbox," as it would lose billions in game sales and give up "a massive portion of the gamers that Activision has worked so hard to attract and retain." It added that "in a world with nearly unlimited gaming alternatives, making Call of Duty exclusive is not a plausible outcome."</p><p>Both companies took issue with the FTC, with Microsoft claiming that its procedures are unconstitutional. "The structure of these administrative proceedings, in which the commission both initiates and finally adjudicates the complaint against Microsoft, violates Microsoft's Fifth Amendment Due Process right to adjudication before a neutral arbiter," Microsoft said in reference to the agency's decision to file the complaint in its own administrative court, rather than in a federal one. The company also argued that hearing the case in the FTC's administrative court "violates Article III of the US Constitution and the separation of powers."</p><div id="8b93ddb050604cce8dded225b1c3ca04"><p style="margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; display: block;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50LzYxNjA1NzU5Mi9BY3RpdmlzaW9uLUJsaXp6YXJkLXMtRm9ybWFsLVJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLXRoZS1GVEMtcy1BbnRpdHJ1c3QtTGF3c3VpdCNmcm9tX2VtYmVkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZjljM2M3Ny1mZWM1LTQ4MWQtODc0Mi1kZDg0MzUyYzA1YjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX-SpyWEPjtDtlbwwJkxkdHr3UInaA_sKxKBjSchwPvX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F616057592%2FActivision-Blizzard-s-Formal-Response-to-the-FTC-s-Antitrust-Lawsuit%23from_embed" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="View Activision Blizzard's Formal Response to the FTC's Antitrust Lawsuit on Scribd">Activision Blizzard's Formal Response to the FTC's Antitrust Lawsuit</a> by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL3VzZXIvNjQ2NjgyNTI2L0tyaXMtSG9sdCNmcm9tX2VtYmVkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZjljM2M3Ny1mZWM1LTQ4MWQtODc0Mi1kZDg0MzUyYzA1YjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaupetxrF34mEP3WO58ZmEStOCesZhkb4Z_QrVC6teZO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F646682526%2FKris-Holt%23from_embed" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="View Kris Holt's profile on Scribd">Kris Holt</a> on Scribd</p></div><p>Activision asserted that by disregarding the supposed benefits to consumers and focusing "on supposed harms to Xbox's deep-pocketed competitors," the FTC was straying from the "underlying purpose" of antitrust laws to protect competition instead of competitors. It said the agency was "blinded by ideological skepticism of high-value technology deals and by complaints from competitors" and that it "lost sight of the realities of the intensely competitive gaming industry."</p><p>Nevertheless, Microsoft wants to agree on conditions with the FTC and other regulators that will lead to them rubberstamping the deal. “Even with confidence in our case, we remain committed to creative solutions with regulators that will protect competition, consumers and workers in the tech sector. As we’ve learned from our lawsuits in the past, the door never closes on the opportunity to find an agreement that can benefit everyone,” Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith said.</p><p>"There is no sensible, legitimate reason for our transaction to be prevented from closing. Our industry has enormous competition and few barriers to entry. We have seen more devices than ever before enabling players a wide range of choices to play games," Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement to Engadget. "Engines and tools are freely available to developers large and small. The breadth of distribution options for games has never been more widespread. We believe we will prevail on the merits of the case.”</p><p>The deadline for the acquisition to close is in July. If it hasn't done so by then, Microsoft and Activision will need to renegotiate the deal or abandon it — Microsoft would then face a breakup fee of as much as $3 billion. As <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/23/microsoft-activision-ftc-response"><em><ins>Axios</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, though, the FTC's antitrust case is set to go before its administrative court on August 2nd. In the meantime, the agency could still seek a preliminary injunction in federal court to stop the deal from closing.</p><p>The proposed acquisition is also facing scrutiny from regulators <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-accuses-uk-regulator-adopting-sony-complaints-activision-probe-095555967.html/"><ins>in the UK</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-opens-phase-two-investigation-microsoft-activision-blizzard-175758027.html/"><ins>the European Union</ins></a>. The jurisdictions' respective competition agencies are expected to issue rulings on the deal in the first half of 2023.</p>

But sometimes things don't always go as planned — Bluetooth connections get interrupted, a snafu occurs and you may find yourself scratching your head a bit before you can listen to your favorite playlist. To help in those situations, we’ve put together a guide to getting your AirPods to pair up with your iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We’ve also included advice on how to connect your buds to non-Apple devices, as well as how to reset your AirPods if you ever need to start from scratch.</p><h2>How to connect AirPods to an iPhone or iPad</h2><p>If you’re trying to pair your AirPods to a new iPhone or iPad, and your buds are already connected to an older model, the connection should automatically transfer to your new device, provided you use the same Apple ID on your new device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>New AirPods, on the other hand, should automatically pair with your iPhone or iPad simply by holding the AirPods case near your device with the lid open. When an image of your new AirPods appears at the bottom of the screen tap the Connect button.</p><p>But that doesn’t always happen. If your AirPods don’t automatically connect, follow these steps:</p><p>1.  Swipe down from the upper right corner of your iPhone or iPad’s screen to open the Control Center.</p><figure><img alt="How to connect your AirPods to your iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch and more" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f617a8c0-75a6-11ed-bcef-dabfa7da424e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>2.

If your AirPods still don’t connect, go back to your home screen (swipe up from the bottom edge of your screen), close the lid on the AirPods, wait 15 seconds, then try the steps again. Make sure both your phone and AirPods are charged and you’re running the most recent version of iOS, which you can check by going to the Settings app, scrolling down to General and tapping on Software Update.</p><h2>How to connect AirPods to a Mac</h2><p>Unlike iPads and iPhones, Macs don’t automatically connect to AirPods. To connect them manually, follow these steps:</p><p>1.

If you need to manually link them, follow these steps:</p><p>1.  Depress the crown to bring up your Home Screen, aka the screen that shows all your apps. If you have grid view turned on, drag the grid around until you find Settings. If you have<em>&nbsp;</em>list view enabled, scroll or turn the crown to find the Settings icon.

Check that your Apple Watch is updated to the latest software version, which, again, you can do by navigating to Settings, tapping General and then Software Update. Finally, make sure Bluetooth is turned on, which is a toggle switch at the bottom of the Bluetooth menu.</p><h2>Other Bluetooth devices</h2><p>Your AirPods and AirPods Pro will connect to many Bluetooth-enabled, non-Apple devices.

## 2022 was an incredible year for handheld gaming

<p>The past year was stellar for handheld gaming, no matter the size of your actual hands. Between the Steam Deck, Playdate and an explosion of retro consoles, we received an embarrassing amount of mobile gaming goodness in 2022, and cloud play is only encouraging more innovation. Even though Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vita-sony-editorial-rip-140000761.html">still hasn’t revived the Vita</a>, it feels like the handheld market is in the throes of a renaissance — so let’s celebrate the milestones of the year right here.</p><div id="dd19eb6f9a6e4d92a8348c22ee5129d1"></div><p>December is a historic month for handheld gaming. Sony released the PlayStation Portable in Japan on December 12th, 2004, and then debuted the Vita in Japan on December 17th, 2011. Both of these consoles were hits with players, critics and developers, but a disorganized marketing scheme and failed cloud ambitions kept Sony from investing in handheld gaming after the Vita. RIP, etc. Basically, for the past decade we’ve been waiting (very patiently, mind you) for a breakthrough mobile device to finally make this industry viable again.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally in 2022, the handheld market is flush. The Switch paved the way for mobile play over the past few years, and massive corporations like Valve are finally getting in on the action. Cloud gaming has found its foothold, and the market for portable Android and Linux devices is buzzing, with major names like Razer getting involved. Meanwhile, more underground companies like Analogue, Ayaneo and Panic are quietly churning out high-quality handhelds for retro, PC and indie gaming.</p><figure><img alt="Steam Deck review 2022" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/f0a6e3c3-95ae-11ec-9dfe-80c9ffcad0b8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>But of course, Valve’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">Steam Deck</a> dominated the portable conversation in 2022. The Steam Deck is big, it’s heavy, it doesn’t have a great battery life – and it’s everything PC players have been waiting for, apparently. Valve started rolling out the Steam Deck in February, and by October it had shipped <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWEwZ0VJZUZnRFgwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NDhlNjk1Ni0yY2UwLTRkYjAtOWQ1Yi1mYjYxOWUzOGNkZWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb3TwlKuQ0V9IUp_UB_tQx7joqqW2X2piZ1DzOUX-ZGN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da0gEIeFgDX0">more than 1 million</a> of these beasts across the western world, with plans to expand into additional regions. Steam Deck comes in three flavors ranging from $400 to $650, which makes it more affordable than existing handheld PC devices from companies like Ayaneo. It comes with Steam pre-installed, but it’ll also run Windows if you really want to spend an afternoon screaming <em>why?</em> at the machine in your lap.</p><p>Imperfect though it may be, Steam Deck proved there’s heat in the handheld PC market in 2022. It’s a relatively accessible way to play PC games on a portable screen, and it successfully combines the Steam software with decades of hardware research at Valve. The Steam Deck is a great start from a company that’s known to lose focus easily, so hopefully it doesn’t all end here.</p><figure><img alt="Steam Deck review 2022" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/f0a6bcb0-95ae-11ec-9bf5-96d1cc025e59" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Even if Valve gets too distracted to make a Steam Deck 2.0, plenty of other companies are eager to pick up the thread in the mobile PC space. The most prominent name is Ayaneo, a brand that took off in 2021 thanks to an Indiegogo campaign that raised more than $2 million. Today, Ayaneo is continuing to iterate on its original PC device with sleek, Switch-sized machines capable of running titles from Steam, the Epic Games Store, Game Pass and other hubs. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html">Ayaneo Air Pro</a> starts at $700 and can technically handle high-fidelity games, though you’ll likely have to lower your framerate, resolution and expectations. The beefiest Ayaneo, the Next Pro, starts at $1,500 and it’ll run anything a Steam Deck can, but without the extra bulk.</p><p>Ayaneo makes extremely cute gadgets and the company is emerging as Valve’s main competitor for portable PC glory. The <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2-completely-different-amd-6800u-handheld#/">Ayaneo 2</a> is poised to pack even more power into a sleek package, though it’ll have a price tag of $1,000, at least. The exciting thing here is that there’s actual competition in the handheld space – companies are investing in mobile hardware more than ever, and not just when it comes to PC play. Recent upgrades in mobile processors are powering a ton of new devices built specifically for retro and cloud gaming.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/602244a0-7ca5-11ed-b757-bb5015c28fc7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>At the end of 2022, the market for retro handhelds is lush, covering every era from NES to GameCube at relatively affordable prices. On the NES to PSP side of things, this year we got the Miyoo Mini and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html">Retroid Pocket 3</a>: The Miyoo Mini costs about $60 and has a modern dual-core processor that can handle even some PS1 games, while the Pocket 3 is an Android-powered handheld that costs $120. For more modern emulation experiences, there’s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayn-odin-review-203045715.html">Odin by Ayn</a>, which can run PS2 and GameCube titles at 1080p on a 5.9-inch screen. The Odin costs between $200 and $290, depending on the model. For retro handhelds, the general rule is the hardware gets more expensive as the era progresses.</p><p>In the honorable mention section, we have the Analogue Pocket, which plays actual physical cartridges from the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, and is unsurprisingly about the size of a classic Game Boy. Analogue started shipping the Pocket at the end of 2021 and it enjoyed a sold-out year, with more orders and accessories due in 2023. Pocket is a special little handheld that breathes new life into classic cartridge libraries, and it comes with a price tag of $220 – which is just about what a Game Boy would cost in today’s coin.</p><figure><img alt="PS Plus Xbox Game Pass" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/0a478030-1a4f-11ed-b7ad-a808c6101da6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>OK, that’s enough about the past. If 2022 has proven anything, it’s that portable gaming has a strong future, and this is going to include cloud and phone play. Cloud technology has finally become reliable enough that even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-premium-comparison-video-152033098.html">Sony figured it out this year</a>, and Microsoft has continued to grow its enormous cloud network, which is intrinsically tied to Game Pass. Our slowly encroaching subscription-based future has created a rich environment for Android- and Linux-based handhelds that don’t need a ton of on-board processing power, as the Steam Deck does. Logitech recently dropped the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-preorder-amazon-logi-play-142636818.html">G Cloud Gaming Handheld</a>, which costs $350, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-5g-gaming-handheld-android-verizon-qualcomm-180049076.html">Razer Edge</a> is an Android-based handheld starting at $400 and expected to start shipping in January.</p><p>This year Razer also released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-v2-android-gamepad-announcement-150058248.html">Kishi V2</a>, which is a $100 gamepad that essentially turns your smartphone into a cloud gaming device. Backbone makes a similar product for iPhone and Android players, and this year the company rolled out an officially licensed <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1552670336428154881">PlayStation gamepad</a> just for iPhone. As mobile processors continue to evolve and cloud technology further stabilizes, smartphone gaming is only going to grow as an industry, and already mainstream entertainment companies like Netflix are joining the fray. Netflix specifically has ushered acclaimed games like <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>, <em>Into the Breach </em>and <em>Spiritfarer </em>onto mobile devices this year, and it’s introduced gems like <em>Poinpy </em>and <em>Hello Kitty Happiness Parade</em>.</p><figure><img alt="Playdate" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/7cf1eb00-bf2f-11ec-9f53-fe84f4e4559e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure><p>Finally, I’d like to take a moment to honor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">Playdate</a>. This brilliant business-card-sized indie gaming machine came out in April; it costs $180, it has a crank, and it doesn’t fit into any existing video game category. Playdate exemplifies innovation. It’s an open-source, crank-powered piece of magic offering some of the most unique experiences the video game industry has to offer, distilled on a miniscule, monochromatic screen. Playdate is pure joy in a tiny yellow package, and for me, it’s <em>the</em> standout handheld of 2022.</p><p>And that’s a wrap. Here’s to you, handheld gaming. Thank you for a fantastic year, and may the momentum of 2022 continue to generate creative ideas in this space. To the years and games ahead, cheers.</p>

## The best PC games for 2023

<p>So how do you categorize a beast like gaming on the PC? With decades of titles to pluck from (and the first port of call for most indie titles, too), there's so much to choose from. Gaming on your PC adds the benefits of (nearly always flawless) backward compatibility and console-beating graphical performance — if you've got the coin for it. The whole idea of what a PC is and where you can play it is shifting, too, with the rise of handheld “consolized” PCs like the Steam Deck. We've tried to be broad with our recommendations here on purpose – there are so many great games out there for your PC, consider these some starting points.</p><h2>Rollerdrome</h2><p></p><p><em>Rollerdrome</em> is lush. It’s incredibly stylish, taking cues from 1970s Hollywood sci-fi but with an attractive cel-shaded filter over every scene. Even better than its stunning visuals, <em>Rollerdrome</em> has smooth, precise mechanics that allow players to fall into a flow in every level. The game is all about gliding through the environments on rollerblades, picking up speed and doing tricks while dodging and shooting enemies, managing weapons and controlling time – and it all comes together in a thrilling dystopian bloodsport.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s a joy to dodge, dodge, dodge and then leap into the air, slow down time and take out the people shooting at you, refilling ammo and collecting health in the process. Meanwhile, an unsettling story of corporate greed unfolds naturally beneath the rollerblading bloodshed, keeping the stakes high. <em>Rollerdrome</em> was a sleeper hit of 2022, so if you’ve been napping on this one, now’s the time to wake up and play.</p><h2>Stray</h2><p></p><p><em>Stray</em> a perfectly contained adventure game that has you embodying a cat in a post-apocalyptic world humans have left behind. It has plenty of fresh ideas, each one pared down to its purest form. Plenty of actions in <em>Stray</em> exist simply because they make sense for a cat protagonist (and probably because they’re cute as hell). There’s a discrete button to meow, and the robots the cat shares its world with react with shock and frustration when you cut across their board game, throwing pieces to the floor. It’s possible to curl up and sleep basically any time, anywhere – even directly on top of a robot stranger. When the cat gets pets and cuddles from the robots, it purrs and the DualSense’s haptics fire up in response. The environmental puzzles take advantage of this cat-level perspective, inviting players to look at the world with different, light-reflective eyes.</p><p>As well as puzzle-solving, ledge-leaping and blob-dodging, <em>Stray</em> introduces a world of lighthearted dystopia, where robots don’t hate the humans that came before them. Instead, they attempt to cultivate plants that can survive in the dark, just because people would have liked that. Compared with most dystopian cyberpunk games, <em>Stray</em> is downright joyful.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you’ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It’s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It’s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you’ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard’s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Beat Saber</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/"><em>Beat Saber</em></a> is a euphoric gaming sensation that makes the most of virtual reality. You'll swing your unofficial lightsabers at incoming boxes, slicing and slamming them to the beat of the soundtrack. Similar to iconic rhythm-rail-shooter, <em>Rez</em>, which has its own VR iteration, <em>Beat Saber</em> often makes you feel like you're creating the music as you hit your cues. We might have had initial reservations on the soundtrack at launch but new tracks and customizations continue to add to the challenge. There's even a level creator for PC players, making this the definitive version.</p><h2>Control</h2><p></p><p>Take the weird<em> Twin Peaks</em> narrative of <em>Alan Wake</em>, smash it together with<em> Quantum Break</em>'s frenetic powers and gunplay, and you've got <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2NvbnRyb2xfdWx0aW1hdGVfZWRpdGlvbj8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ODgzMTdjLTA4YmMtMzc3Zi1hNDYwLTM2NDY5N2Y0Yjc1ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVoMosYPtd4HwheMmYKZb6sMF8-j_AKxiIauZp5Z3Sp3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fcontrol_ultimate_edition%3F"><em>Control</em></a>. Playing as a woman searching for her missing brother, you quickly learn there's a thin line between reality and the fantastical. It's catnip for anyone who grew up loving <em>The X-Files</em> and the supernatural. It's also a prime example of a studio working at their creative heights, both refining and evolving the open-world formula that's dominated games for the past decade.</p><h2>Disco Elysium Final Cut</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9nYW1lL2Rpc2NvX2VseXNpdW0_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDg4MzE3Yy0wOGJjLTM3N2YtYTQ2MC0zNjQ2OTdmNGI3NWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV_riA3RCmEe-kCXw-LaoWEc0kL6fiiH793WwDnrOQl6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fgame%2Fdisco_elysium%3F"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a> is a special game. The first release from Estonian studio ZA/UM, it's a sprawling science-fiction RPG that takes more inspiration from D&amp;D and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> than modern combat-focused games. In fact, there is no combat to speak of, instead, you'll be creating your character, choosing what their strengths and weaknesses are, and then passing D&amp;D-style skill checks to make your way through the story. You'll, of course, be leveling up your abilities and boosting stats with items, but really the game's systems fall away in place of a truly engaging story, featuring some of the finest writing to ever grace a video game.</p><p>With the <em>Final Cut</em>, released 18 months after the original, this extremely dialogue-heavy game now has full voice acting, which brings the unique world more to life than ever before. After debuting on PC, PS5 and Stadia, <em>Final Cut </em>is now available for all extant home consoles – including Nintendo’s Switch.</p><h2>Halo Infinite</h2><p></p><p>Master Chief's latest adventure may not make much sense narratively, but it sure is fun to play. After the middle efforts from 343 Industries over the last decade, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> manages to breathe new life into Microsoft's flagship franchise, while also staying true to elements fans love. The main campaign is more open than ever, while also giving you a new freedom of movement with the trusty grappling hook. And the multiplayer mode is wonderfully addictive (though 343 still needs to speed up experience progression), with a bevy of maps and game modes to keep things from getting too stale. The only thing keeping it from greatness is its baffling and disjointed story.</p><h2>FTL: Faster Than Light</h2><p></p><p>Who hasn't wanted to captain their own spaceship? Well, after a few hours of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2Zhc3Rlcl90aGFuX2xpZ2h0PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdrQ75BsafAXma244Ld51yOzFENYCToeILyDw_sN8_Q-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ffaster_than_light%3F"><em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em></a>, you might be rethinking your life goals. <em>FTL</em> is a roguelike, which means every game starts from the same spot. All you have to do is travel through a number of star systems, recruiting crew members and collecting scrap as you make your way towards a final showdown against a stupidly overpowered ship. Gameplay is roughly divided between a map view, where you can take as much time as you like to chart the most efficient route to your goal, and combat events which play out in real-time (although you can and will be using a pause button to slow things down).</p><p>Where the real fun comes in is in the narrative, which plays out in two ways. There's the structured side, where every so often you'll be asked to make decisions that may improve or hinder your chances of survival. And then there's the natural story you create for yourselves, as you're forced to decide, for example, whether it's worth sacrificing a crew member for the greater good.</p><h2>Hades</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/"><em>Hades</em></a> was the first early access title to ever make our best PC game list. It's an action-RPG developed by the team behind <em>Bastion</em>, <em>Transistor</em> and <em>Pyre</em>. You play Zagreus, son of Hades, who's having a little spat with his dad, and wants to escape from the underworld. To do so, Zagreus has to fight his way through the various levels of the underworld and up to the surface. Along the way, you’ll pick up “boons” from a wide range of ancient deities like Zeus, Ares and Aphrodite, which stack additional effects on your various attacks. Each level is divided into rooms full of demons, items and the occasional miniboss.</p><p>As <em>Hades</em> is a “roguelike” game, you start at the same place every time. With that said the items you collect can be used to access and upgrade new weapons and abilities that stick between sessions. <em>Hades</em> is on this list not for any reason other than it’s super accessible and very, very fun. You can jump in for 30 minutes and have a blast, or find yourself playing for hours.</p><h2>Half-Life: Alyx</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> feels like a miracle. After 13 years away from the franchise, Valve delivered a genuinely thrilling prequel to <em>Half-Life 2</em> while also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html">charting new territory for VR gameplay</a>. The gravity gloves, its key new feature, is the closest I’ve ever felt to having telekinetic powers. It gives you multiple movement options so you don’t get sick trotting around the expansive environments. Oh yeah, and it’s also absolutely terrifying, banking on the claustrophobic nature of VR. There’s no looking away when a facehugger leaps at you from the dark, or when a horrifically deformed zombie gets in your face. It might sound a bit hyperbolic, but <em>Alyx</em> might end up being one of the most important titles of this generation. Building a big-budget game for a niche VR market doesn’t make much sense for most companies, but for Valve, it’s Tuesday.</p><h2>Nier Automata</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/"><em>Nier Automata</em></a> takes the razor-sharp combat of a Platinum Games title and puts it in a world crafted by everyone's favorite weirdo, Yoko Taro. Don't worry, you can mostly just run, gun and slash your way through the game, but as you finish, and finish and finish this one, you'll find yourself pulled into a truly special narrative, that's never been done before and will probably never be done again. It's fair to say that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/">PC release</a>, as is unfortunately often the case, wasn't exactly the best and is still remarkably lacking in options, but it's at least stable now, and trust us when we say this one is unmissable.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator</strong></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> came out at the perfect time, when the world was on lockdown and airline travel was an impossibility for most people. Not only does <em>Flight Sim</em> let players pilot a vast array of aircrafts, but it presents the world on a platter in stunning, ridiculous detail. It’s an escape, it’s educational and it’s entertaining – is that what they mean by E3? – and there’s really nothing else on its level when it comes to realistic physics simulations. Pandemic or no, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is an incredible achievement with a long tail both inside and outside of the video game industry.</p><h2>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h2><p></p><p>Many were ready to write off the Resident Evil series after the disaster that was <em>Resident Evil 6</em>. What started as <em>the</em> horror game on the original PlayStation had become a bloated mess of an action game. Instead of throwing the whole franchise in the trash and forgetting about it, Capcom took a hard look at what wasn't working, which — surprise! — was basically everything, and thoroughly rebooted the formula. Borrowing from Kojima's <em>PT</em> and, in some ways, Creative Assembly's <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/"><em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em></a> is horror through powerlessness. For the majority of the game, you're basically unable to do anything but run from or delay your foes. And that's what makes it so good.</p><h2>Return of the Obra Dinn</h2><p></p><p>This is an unforgettable ghost-story-slash-murder-mystery with a distinctive old-school graphical style. It's unlike any game we've played in a while, with a low-key musical score and a style of puzzle solving that's like one satisfying, grisly riddle. In <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3JldHVybl9vZl90aGVfb2JyYV9kaW5uPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeP6nCFhSdxlwIEllwkLXaS0N5p2Vc5KzDND7MVUXX6w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Freturn_of_the_obra_dinn%3F"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a><em>,</em> you're put aboard a ship, alone. There is, however, a corpse near the captain's cabin. As you track the deceased's final footsteps, leading to yet more grisly ends, you need to figure out what happened. Who killed who? And who is still alive? Special mention to the sound effect that kicks in every time you solve the fates of three of the crew. Goosebumps.</p><h2>The Witcher 3</h2><p></p><p>It might be the best open-world RPG out there. Despite now being several years old, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9nYW1lL3RoZV93aXRjaGVyXzNfd2lsZF9odW50X2dhbWVfb2ZfdGhlX3llYXJfZWRpdGlvbj8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ODgzMTdjLTA4YmMtMzc3Zi1hNDYwLTM2NDY5N2Y0Yjc1ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeXrpItBXiYrNntA2YmkVjPCT991SIF-DZNMSSFqlepo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fgame%2Fthe_witcher_3_wild_hunt_game_of_the_year_edition%3F"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a> is a dense action game that acknowledges the maturity of the player with multiple — occasionally harrowing — storylines, choices that have consequences and almost too much game to wrestle with. It's not perfect; the combat system is rough, frustrating death comes in the form of falling from just a few feet and there's a lot of quest filler alongside many incredibly well thought out distractions. The scope and ambition on display will have you hooked, and once you're done, there are some excellent expansions to check out.</p><h2>Forza Horizon 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>deftly walks a fine line by being an extremely deep and complex racing game that almost anyone can just pick up and play. The game has hundreds of cars that you can tweak endlessly to fit your driving style, and dozens of courses spread all over a gorgeous fictional corner of Mexico. If you crank up the difficulty, one mistake will sink your entire race, and the competition online can be just as fierce.</p><p>But if you’re new to racing games, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> does an excellent job at getting you up and running. The introduction to the game quickly gives you a taste at the four main race types you’ll come across (street racing, cross-country, etc.), and features like the rewind button mean that you can quickly erase mistakes if you try and take a turn too fast without having to restart your run. Quite simply, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is a beautiful and fun game that works for just about any skill level. It’s easy to pick up and play a few races and move on with your day, or you can sink hours into it trying to become the best driver you can possibly be.</p><p></p>

## The EQS SUV is the height of Mercedes EV luxury

<p>Mercedes isn’t tip-toeing into electrification. The automaker put together an aggressive plan and it shows no sign of slowing down. That’s why every few months it seems like there’s another Mercedes-Benz EV being announced.</p><p>In all this removal of gas-powered engines, Mercedes still needs to make sure to build vehicles that exude the luxury customers have come to expect from the automaker. It started with the EQS as the electric version of the S-Class sedan and followed that up with the EQS SUV. A taller vehicle with more headroom, off-road capabilities and the number one feature wanted by the US market: it’s an SUV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the parity of tech features between the EQS and EQS SUV is impressive, the one thing that S-Class owners moving to an electric luxury vehicle will notice is the increased headroom in the EQS SUV. There’s also the design, which looks better on the SUV, and if you opt for all-wheel-drive the off-roading capabilities are there for when the second home happens to be up a dirt road.</p><p>Still, we put the EQS SUV to the test and found that overall it’s an impressive entry into the luxury EV SUV market, even with its weird regenerative brake pedal.

## Twitter Blue perks now include higher ranking replies and 60-minute video uploads

<p>Twitter Blue has enabled new perks for subscribers including &quot;prioritized rankings in conversations&quot; and video uploads up to 60 minutes in length, according to an <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">updated feature list</a> spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/twitter-blue-users-can-now-upload-60-minute-long-videos/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Both features were promised by Elon Musk last month when <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587500060853424129">he said</a> Blue subscribers who pay $8 per month would get &quot;priority in replies, mentions &amp; search&quot; and the ability to post long videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Reply priority is now in effect, with the support page stating that &quot;this feature prioritizes your replies on Tweets that you interact with.&quot; That seems to be the case on <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1606198170748424195">several</a><a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1604716932300955648">tweets</a> I looked at, with Twitter Blue subscribers (many with few followers) appearing as the top replies. It's not clear if users paying $8 per month will always appear at the top in replies, or whether or factors are also used.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="942ed2c4f873414985ab0eb815396c18"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">soon, subscribers with the blue checkmark will get priority ranking in search, mentions, and replies to help lower the visibility of scams, spam and bots</p>— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1602426811656413189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Twitter support said earlier that priority rankings will &quot;help lower the visibility of scams, spam and bots.&quot; However, some users have expressed <a href="https://twitter.com/AlWerner68/status/1606260356531118080">concern</a> that the new system will lower the experience for non-paying users, or that paid priority might help spammers, trolls and others amplify their messages.&nbsp;</p><p>The new video rules will boost length from 10 minutes and 512MB to 60 minutes and 2GB at up to 1080p resolution, though only on the web — the 10-minute rule still applies to Android and iOS users. Twitter also notes that it may &quot;modify or adapt your original video for distribution, syndication, publication or broadcast by us and our partners&quot; or change the bitrate/resolution depending on a viewer's internet speeds.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk said that Twitter will eventually pay creators for uploaded videos, noting that it might even exceed the 55 percent cut that YouTube offers. However, it hasn't said whether that will be done with ads or other means. It's also not clear how it may address piracy issues, given that much of its moderation team <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/15/elon-musk-cuts-twitter-content-moderation-staff/10706732002/">has been let go or quit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: YouTube is the new home of NFL Sunday Ticket

<p>YouTube is ready for some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-155108503.html https://www.engadget.com/...">more football</a>. The streaming service has snagged the rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package, which offers access to out-of-market games that air on Fox and CBS each Sunday. DirecTV, the current home of Sunday Ticket, has held the rights since 1994, but the bundle will move to Google’s streaming service next season. YouTube and the NFL didn’t announce the terms of the deal, but according to <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> YouTube will pay $2 billion per year in a seven-year pact – around $500 million more per season than DirecTV is paying.</p><p>Having exclusive rights to a bundle with many out-of-market NFL games should draw even more users to YouTube. Live sport coverage is turning into the next battleground for streaming. Amazon Prime Video has an 11-year deal to stream Thursday Night Football games that started this season. Meanwhile, Apple is pushing further into live sports as well, with a 10-year deal to stream every Major League Soccer game via Apple TV starting in 2023.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-employees-us-user-data-journalists-210339650.html"><ins>ByteDance fired four employees who accessed US journalists' TikTok data</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html"><ins>The best PlayStation 5 games for 2023</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-making-its-internal-video-blurring-privacy-tool-open-source-150052840.html"><ins>Google is making its internal video-blurring privacy tool open source | Engadget</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-companies-union-labor-2022-150022946.html"><ins>Rank and file tech workers have been fed up.

## Jack Sweeney brings a delayed version of @ElonJet back to Twitter

<p>Last week, Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-elonjet-banned-suspended-elon-musk-private-jet-153132962.html">banned</a> Jack Sweeney's @ElonJet account that tracked Elon Musk's private jet, then unveiled a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-rules-about-location-sharing-amid-elonjet-controversy-005013326.html">new policy</a> against sharing live locations shortly afterward. Now, Sweeney is back with a new account called @ElonJetNexDay that still tracks Musk's aircraft, but adds a 24-hour delay to the location, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/jack-sweeney-brings-back-elonjet-but-delayed-to-twitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported.</p><p>It appears to be Sweeney's effort conform to Twitter's new rules, which state that it's permissible to share &quot;publicly available information after a reasonable time has elapsed, so that the individual is no longer at risk for physical harm.&quot; The account has only been online for a short time, however, so it remains to be seen whether Twitter will see it the same way</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sweeney and his @ElonJet account have been on Musk's radar for a while. In January, a few months before Musk announced a deal to buy Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-elonjet-twitter-bot-221826608.html/">he offered Sweeney $5,000 to delete the account</a>. Sweeney rejected the overture, instead asking for $50,000. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/twitter-suspends-elonjet-account-that-tracks-elon-musks-private-jet-.html/"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, @ElonJet had more than half a million followers.&nbsp;</p><p>The ban came about after Elon Musk said a car carrying his son X Æ A-12 was followed by a stalker in Los Angeles. Twitter soon told Sweeney that his account &quot;broke Twitter rules,&quot; though didn't specify which ones. Musk later said that &quot;legal action&quot; would be taken against Sweeney and &quot;organizations who supported harm to my family.&quot;</p><p>Sweeney's @ElonJet tracker bot now has 67,000 followers on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@elonjet">Mastadon</a> and tracks jets belonging to Musk and others on Facebook and Instagram. The bans are part of a large amount of Twitter drama around Musk that recently culminated in one of Musk's famous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/it-looks-like-elon-musk-is-going-to-find-someone-new-to-run-twitter-121055836.html">Twitter polls</a>, with a decisive number of users voting that he should step down as CEO of Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fallout from Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal continues over four years after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-17-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-analysis-chris-wylie.html">first exposed</a>. Parent company Meta has agreed to pay $725 million to settle a long-running class-action lawsuit accusing Facebook of allowing Cambridge Analytica and other third parties to access user's private information, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-pay-725-mln-settle-lawsuit-relating-cambridge-analytica-2022-12-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>The settlement resolves user claims that Facebook violated federal and state laws by allowing the company's preferred vendors and partners to harvest their personal data without consent. It's reportedly the largest ever in a US data privacy class action and the most Meta has ever paid to resolve a class-action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,&quot; the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which is still subject to approval by a federal judge. &quot;Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program,&quot; Meta said in a statement, adding that the settlement &quot;was in the best interest of our community and shareholders.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Cambridge Analytica, now defunct, worked for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaigns. It accessed the personal data of up to 87 million people by an app (thisisyourdigitallife) and used the information gathered to target individuals with personally tailored messages. The scandal was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-17-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-analysis-chris-wylie.html">exposed</a> by <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em> in 2018, thanks in large part to whistleblower Christopher Wylie.</p><p>In 2019, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-facebook-will-pay-5-billion-fine-for-cambridge-analytica-data-b.html">agreed to pay</a> a $5 billion fine following a Federal Trade Commission investigation and $100 million to settle US Securities and Exchange Commission claims. It also paid £500,000 (about $644,000) in fines to the UK, a pittance compared to what it would have paid had the GDPR been in place when the scandal occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook hasn't put Cambridge Analytica behind it yet, either. The company is still fighting a lawsuit by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-19-washington-dc-sues-facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal.html">Washington DC attorney general</a>, as well as a number of state attorneys general.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/wireless-charging-platform">a wireless phone charger</a> that holds not one, not two, but three entire phones! And charges them wirelessly! Tesla makes it! For just $300! Shut up and take my money! Are you kidding me?! This is phenomenal! JANET! HEY JANET, GET MY WALLET, IT'S ON THE NIGHTSTAND.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Inspired by the angular design and metallic styling of Cybertruck,&quot; with 15W of power! That sounds like a lot! I should see what my normal charger does, bet it's not half as much as this thing. Stupid normal charger, not even modeled after a truck that's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-production-2023-152051543.html">not even in production yet</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And look at this build quality. It's got everything: aluminum housing, an alcantara surface (who doesn't love the feel of a suede-like microfiber material?) and a detachable magnetic stand that both lays flat and sits at an angle! This way I can never not be looking at my three phones, even when they're charging. This is going to be so awesome. Best three hundred dollars plus tax I'll probably ever spend. JANET, WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT WALLET?</p><p>Hell yeah, it uses FreePower technology, that means I'll be able to just throw a few grand worth of Qi-compatible earbuds, mobile devices, smart watches and accessories on this thing all willy-nilly. Won't have to line them up or anything because that's how I do it. I'm the type who moves fast and breaks things.</p><p>Aw, whaddya mean it's not coming out until February? In Tesla months that could be years from now! JANET! IX-NAY ON THE ALLET-WAY!</p>

## The Lastpass hack was worse than the company first reported

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-reveals-another-security-breach-075158853.html">being hacked for the second time in as many years this August</a>, password manager app Lastpass announced on Thursday the most recent intrusion was much more damaging than initially reported with the attackers having made off with users' password vaults in some cases. That means the thieves have people's entire collections of encrypted personal data, if not the immediate method to unlock them.</p><p>&quot;No customer data was accessed during the August 2022 incident,&quot; LastPass CEO Karim Toubba, explained. However, some of the app's source code was lifted and then used to spearphish a Lastpass employee into giving up their access credentials, then used those keys to decrypt and copy off, &quot;some storage volumes within the cloud-based storage service.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Among the encrypted data obtained by the hackers included basic customer account information like company names, billing, email and IP addresses; and telephone numbers, Toubba continued. &quot;These encrypted fields remain secured with 256-bit AES encryption and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user’s master password using our Zero Knowledge architecture,&quot; Toubba said. &quot;As a reminder, the master password is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by LastPass.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Still, you're going to take the company's word for it? I'm not. It'll be a pain but swapping out all of your various existing site passwords for new ones — as well as picking a new master password — might ultimately prove necessary to regain your online security. Or you could just tell Lastpass to go kick rocks and switch over to 1Password or Bitwarden.</p>
