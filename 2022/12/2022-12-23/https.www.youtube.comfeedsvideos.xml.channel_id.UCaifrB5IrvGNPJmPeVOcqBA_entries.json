Crusted with ice and infested with the dead, the dwarves there have perished and rumor has it that the brute that killed them still roams those rime crusted wastes. A mighty feat it'd be for someone to capture that monster. Though, surely none would dare such an insane feat..\n\n--------------------\n\nYou can send fan art to Kruggsmash@gmail.com if you want it featured at the end of the episode OR if you just want me to see it. Please remember to let me know what you'd like to be called when the art is shown and if you have a title for the piece! Also remember that your art is totally valid and if anybody gives you guff about it, i'll kick them right in the ass.\n\n--------------------\n\nThanks to everyone who helped out with this episode!\n\n -Mrs K for her unending support and expert waxwork (she colors all the drawings.
