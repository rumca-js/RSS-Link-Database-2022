<p>After a decade or more of gaming keyboards being synonymous with big, thicc (note the two Cs!) MX-style switches, it looks as if thin is in once again. Razer&rsquo;s here to meet the trend with an update to its Deathstalker line. Previously a series of ultra&ndash;sleek, ultra-slim boards, the new Deathstalker Pro uses low-profile mechanical switches to land somewhere between the new and the old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Razer has put just about every one of its premium features into this design, with the notable exception of its analog switches, which haven&rsquo;t gotten the miniaturization treatment yet. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s the general gaming goodness you&rsquo;re familiar with, plus dual-channel wireless, a snazzy volume wheel, and a dedicated media button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that enough for a $250 keyboard? Frankly, no. But if you feel like treating yourself (or a gamer gift recipient), it&rsquo;ll be a nice change of pace from the chunky status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="deathstalker-v2-pro-features">Deathstalker V2 Pro: Features&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Deathstalker V2 Pro is the biggest and most expensive of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-deathstalker-v2&amp;xcust=2-1-1438527-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a trio of new boards</a>. It comes in the same full-size form factor, sans wireless powers, or in a more compact wireless and tenkeyless design. Beyond that you get the choice between clicky or linear switches &mdash; most gamers will prefer the latter. It comes in any color you want, so long as you want black (white coming eventually!), but Razer&rsquo;s typical per-key RGB Chroma lighting is present, sans any embellishment on the side and bottom.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Deathstalker V2 volume wheel" class="wp-image-1438530" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09743.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Razer&rsquo;s low-profile switches are a little stiff compared to the larger MX-style keys with longer key travel, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to get used to them. They&rsquo;re much more comfortable than the super-skinny Ultra Cherry Low Profile seen on the slightly more expensive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357631/corsair-k100-air-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Corsair K100 Air</a> and roughly comparable to the Kailh Choc keys that have been on the market for a while. If you&rsquo;re used to any mechanical board (or a really good laptop keyboard), you&rsquo;ll feel right at home.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Desthstalker V2 key switches" class="wp-image-1438531" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09758.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Those low-profile keys make the keyboard notably more sleek than Razer&rsquo;s conventional designs. With a height of just one inch at the thickest (about 1.75&Prime; with the dual-stage feet fully extended), it&rsquo;s easy to toss in a bag&hellip;so long as your bag can accommodate its full-size length of a tad over 17 inches. Go for the TKL design if you need something a bit more compact.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="deathstalker-v2-pro-thin-is-in">Deathstalker V2 Pro: Thin is In</h2>



<p>The most obvious addition on the top of the board is the comfy, extra-wide volume scroll wheel on the far right. This has become something of a standard in premium designs, but it&rsquo;s well-implemented here: a solid metal wheel with comfy kerning lets you scroll confidently. It&rsquo;s a little tricky to get the downward push (a la a gamepad joystick) to set volume to mute by default &mdash; I often found myself scrolling a bit after pressing and thus canceling the mute action. The play/pause button to the left is fine, and easy to distinguish.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Deathstalker V2 Pro versus full-height mechanical keyboard" class="wp-image-1438532" height="341" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09814.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Deathstalker V2 Pro versus full-height mechanical keyboard</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>The aluminum top extends to the sides before transitioning to a weight-saving plastic bottom. On the top edge, you&rsquo;ll find a power toggle that switches between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (with 1000Hz, 1ms &ldquo;HyperSpeed&rdquo; tech, literally too fast for me to measure) when not in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position. There are also three dedicated device buttons, a handy change from tucking that feature in the function layer.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Deathstalker V2 Pro device controls and charging port" class="wp-image-1438534" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09802.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a smart layout. While I prefer a little more key travel, I was able to transition to the Deathstalker on my usual games with no trouble. Again, it was far more comfortable than the Corsair K100 Air on the extreme end of the thinness meter. Battery life was about a week of regular use (including hours of typing for work every day) with the lights on medium. If you can live without them, Razer claims almost 200 hours of use, a figure I have no reason to doubt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="deathstalker-v2-pro-software">Deathstalker V2 Pro: Software&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Razer&rsquo;s Synapse driver system has become simpler and more straightforward over the years, a much-appreciated change. I also like how you don&rsquo;t have to log in to make changes, even though Synapse makes it <em>really </em>clear that it wants you to. The quick links for reprogramming the scroll wheel are helpful &mdash; by default, you can set it to control standard volume, mic volume, standard mouse-style scrolling, page zoom, device brightness, or scroll through Windows apps.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Synapse Deathstalker V2 Pro" class="wp-image-1438536" height="645" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/razer-synapse.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Otherwise the software is its usual, serviceable self, with a huge amount of lighting and device-linking options. You also get the choice to set time-outs for lighting and the wireless power-saving mode, which takes a second to wake the keyboard up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately in order to get that programming to stick, you need to keep Synapse installed and running. I&rsquo;ve seen similar limitations on the built-in profiles before (see also left and right scrolling on Razer mice). It&rsquo;d be nice if Razer could find a way around this limitation, because at the moment it feels like an intentional omission to keep Synapse around.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="deathstalker-v2-pro-still-too-pricey">Deathstalker V2 Pro: Still Too Pricey&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Aside from just one software limitation and a slightly finicky mute button &mdash; which you can easily program around &mdash; it&rsquo;s hard to find any low points for the Deathstalker. Except for the $250 price, of course. I realize that there are a lot of $200+ keyboards out there, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean any of them are fairly priced, and the Deathstalker&rsquo;s low-profile keys aren&rsquo;t a feature that demands such a premium.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Deathstalker V2 keys" class="wp-image-1438535" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC09837.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>To justify this expense, the keyboard would need something with more <em>oomph </em>in its spec sheet. More dramatic lighting, incredible battery life, the ability to transform and roll out, heck, I&rsquo;d even take a wrist rest. There&rsquo;s a notable lack of one, despite some very comfy Razer wrist rests included in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541284/razer-blackwidow-v3-pro-review-a-wireless-keyboard-with-gaming-audacity.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">keyboards like the Huntsman and Blackwidow</a> (the latter of which is cheaper than the Deathstalker).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to similar offerings like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NY9ZRZG/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1438527-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logitech G915</a>, the Deathstalker is pricey. Compared to budget options from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/829816/redragon-k596-wireless-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Redragon</a> and Keychron, it&rsquo;s exorbitant.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a nice board if you want something sleeker than normal and you&rsquo;re already invested in Razer&rsquo;s ecosystem. But for regular gamers, it&rsquo;s just too expensive to recommend. </p>

## Happy Festivus! Air your Windows grievances via the Feedback Hub

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Whether you celebrate Festivus or not, you can air your grievances about Windows today &mdash; or any day &mdash; via the Windows Feedback Hub.</p>



<p>The Windows Feedback Hub is an app within Windows 10 and Windows 11. It&rsquo;s like a suggestion box: you can tell Microsoft what&rsquo;s wrong (or right) about Windows 10 or 11, suggest new features, alert developers of bugs, and so on. It&rsquo;s a direct line to Microsoft, even if they might not directly (or quickly) respond to your feedback.</p>



<p>The Feedback Hub is a more powerful version of the ballot box. Not only can you suggest your own improvements, but you can find other suggestions or complaints and upvote them too. If there&rsquo;s a critical mass of feedback on a given issue, Microsoft has to take care of it, right?</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-the-windows-feedback-hub">How to use the Windows Feedback Hub</h2>



<p>First, make sure that you&rsquo;re signed into your Microsoft account on a Windows machine. To open the Feedback Hub, press the Windows key and type <strong>Feedback Hub</strong> in the box.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Feedback Hub" class="wp-image-1431708" height="922" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Feedback-Hub-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Windows Feedback Hub home screen.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Feedback Hub opens onto the Home screen, which really could use a visual redesign after several years of existence. There are two prominent buttons: &ldquo;Report a problem&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suggest a feature.&rdquo; The page will also report other elements of your participation with the Windows community, including whether you&rsquo;re part of the Insider program. One handy feature is a list of recent announcements by the Windows team, announcing new features (generally to Insiders) as well as any new Insider builds.</p>



<p>Both of the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suggest&rdquo; buttons lead to a similar screen, where you can &ldquo;Summarize your feedback&rdquo; with a summary headline, then dive into more detail if you wish. Don&rsquo;t forget to continue to the entries following it, either, including the choice of a &ldquo;category.&rdquo; </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Feedback Hub" class="wp-image-1431709" height="919" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Feedback-Hub-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Your initial feedback in the Feedback Hub goes here.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s these smaller categories that specify which feature or app or section within Windows that your complaint or suggestion is addressing. As you might imagine, suggestions/complaints about specific topics will be routed to the teams responsible for those parts of Windows. </p>



<p>Remember, too, that you&rsquo;re making a public declaration to Microsoft. If you&rsquo;re signed in, Microsoft will see your name and so will others. Don&rsquo;t be childish and simply complain that &ldquo;this thing sucks!&rdquo; &mdash; not only is it not helpful, but it will likely be dismissed outright.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Feedback Hub" class="wp-image-1431707" height="947" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Feedback-Hub-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft makes a guess as to where your Feedback Hub feedback should go, but feel free to correct it.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Naturally, you might not be the first to have this particular complaint or suggestion. Microsoft then directs you to &ldquo;find similar feedback,&rdquo; which presumably groups your feedback alongside it. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Feedback Hub" class="wp-image-1431712" height="926" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Feedback-Hub-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Others may have the same complaint.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Finally, you have the option of sending a screenshot or screen recording to support your request or document a bug. For the latter, you can ask Microsoft to send along diagnostic information (if you opt in) to help find the underlying causes of the bug.</p>



<p>While the other headings in the left-hand navigation bar can be useful (though Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t appear to have kept its Achievements up to date), the Feedback listing is worth checking out. Here, you&rsquo;ll see what other Windows users think needs to be fixed, from both a top-down perspective as well as a category view. You&rsquo;re welcome to upvote and comment underneath any request. Microsoft will also occasionally append a note on whether they&rsquo;ve addressed the issue or not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Feedback Hub" class="wp-image-1431710" height="927" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Feedback-Hub-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Though it&rsquo;s somewhat buried, this is the richest part of the Feedback  Hub.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Longtime users may complain that Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t respond to feedback as quickly as they used to. And sometimes it feels more satisfactory to vent on Twitter, Facebook, or even YouTube. But if you ever want to complain about Windows or provide a helpful suggestion, open the Feedback Hub! That&rsquo;s the place to do it.</p>
