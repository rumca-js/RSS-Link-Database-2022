Covers that feel even more emotional than the originals are rapidly becoming a hallmark of Magaziine and this week is certainly no exception. In this week’s “Cry Me a River”, we hear vocals from Arielle Kasnetz and Ebony Loren that perfectly encapsulates feelings of regret, sadness, disgust, and just the perfect amount of anger. Pairing their vocals with the amazing synth section from Jack, Will, & Swatkins makes this song feel like the ultimate “living well is the best revenge” song.
