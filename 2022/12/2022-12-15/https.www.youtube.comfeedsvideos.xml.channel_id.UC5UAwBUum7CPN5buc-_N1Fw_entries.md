Notekit is a nice alternative for Linux and Windows. It uses markdown. It doesn't have a mobile app, or syncing capabilities though.

Nextcloud Collectives lets you create knowledge bases straight from your Nextcloud server. You can create Collectives, which are basically notebooks, and pages inside of these. They support text formatting, adding images, todolists, emojis, codeblocks, or tables.

Obsidian is NOT open source, available for Linux, windows, macos, iOS and Android. It lets you organize text documents in one place, with a focus on connecting your documents, with a graph view that represents all the links from one note to another. It supports markdown, and has a big plugin system. It's really powerful.

Zettlr is another open source, and free of charge alternative, more geared towards research. It supports tabs in the interface, it has full markdown capabilities, including YAML frontmatter variables, it lets you organize your files through folders, and it handles external reference documents that you can link to your notes.

All of the previous solutions didn't include mobile apps, or native syncing capabilities, so let's look at one that does all that: Joplin. It supports images, videos, documents, audio files, math formulas, as well as note sharing and collaboration, saving web pages as notes with a browser extension, and you can write in markdown. It has mobile apps for iOS and Android, and you can sync your notes using your own cloud storage, like Nextcloud, Dropbox or OneDrive, or you can use Joplin Cloud.

And if all you want is hand written notes, then there's Rnote. It supports writing notes using a stylus, with pressure sensitivity, it has shape tools, selection tools, you can customize the page background and format, configure stylus buttons, it supports drag and drop, importing from various file formats.

Now, let's looks at non open source alternatives.

Zoho Notebooks lets you create notebooks, with notes inside of them. They support rich txt formatting, adding media files, like images or audio, linking other file types like PDFs, you can set reminders in notes, have todo lists, tables, quotes, code blocks, and it supports hand written notes as well. They have a mobile app for iOS and Android, a web clipper extension to save web pages to your notes, and it has a Linux version as well, although it seems to only be a debian package.

Notion, is an extremely flexible program, that lets you create not only text notes, but also todo lists, project management tools, tables, knowledge bases, meeting notes, roadmaps, kandban boards, and more. You can create your own templates or grab them from the community, and you can organize all of that into one single workspace.

Evernote does everything, from todos, text, rich formatting, audio notes, web clippings, notebooks, tags, advanced search, tables, calendars, task management, it's evolved past its note taking roots and basically became a full on workspace where you can do anything you need that's work related.
