About a year ago I </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/personal-response-to-omicron">wrote</a>
that I'd now:



<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
follow official guidance and mask regulations, cheerfully go
along with precautions others need, and test+isolate when sick, but
I'm not going to go above and beyond to attempt to reduce spread the
way I did for earlier parts of the pandemic.
</blockquote>



<p>

And yet I'm often wearing an N95 in situations where they're not
required and a large majority of other people aren't masked.  Are
these in tension?

</p>

<p>

My views haven't changed.  I still think that if my region and the
communities I'm part of aren't going to put a serious effort into
keeping covid from spreading then it doesn't make sense for me to make
large sacrifices on my own for pro-social reasons.  But if I get
covid, or one of the several other things going around, I'll need to
isolate to avoid getting other people sick.  That means missing things
I'd be very sad to miss, and I'll take steps to avoid that:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>I masked at the <a href="http://metasub.org/2022-agenda/">MetaSUB</a> conference the
weekend before Thanksgiving.

</p></li>
<li><p>I masked at Sunday's <a href="https://www.eaboston.org/">EA dinner</a> and my work's holiday
party because I'm running music for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3403227779922411">secular
solstice</a> this Saturday (sort of an atheist church service inspired
by ideas from the effective altruism and rationalist communities).

</p></li>
<li><p>I'm planning to mask at the solstice event because it's just
before relatives come to town for Christmas.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

On the other hand, I didn't mask at Thanksgiving and I'm not planning
on masking at Christmas because being sick right after that is, while
not ideal, basically fine.

</p>

<p>

While this does have pro-social effects, slowing down the rate of
transmission of airborne diseases, my motivation here is primarily
selfish: I don't want to miss things.
