The two pillars of the harsh zero-Covid policy of the CCP over the past three years are the full-scale nucleic acid testing and the city lockdowns. For ordinary Chinese, 7 to 10 nucleic acid tests a week is the norm, and for a large city with tens of millions of people, a city-wide nucleic acid test completed in just 2 to 3 days is not uncommon.

In late November 2022, a white paper revolution took place in over 20 cities in China, with "No Nucleic Acid Test, Yes Freedom" as one of the slogans of the movement.  In parallel with the white paper revolution, Chinese netizens are searching for an individual named "Zhang Shanshan. " This person has revealed to the public the shocking truth of the CCP's nucleic acid testing.

Overseas Chinese students used to be a considerable asset to the Chinese Communist Party CCP. In recent years, intelligence agencies in Western countries have come to realize that the Beijing government has a large network of secret agents abroad including various hometown associations, chambers of commerce, and the CSSA Chinese Students and Scholars Association at universities. In those CSSA, certain students are picked and paid by local embassies and consulates to help monitor other Chinese students. This network of Chinese students overseas has also been manipulated by the CCP to export its values to Western countries and to interfere in the internal affairs of the host countries.
