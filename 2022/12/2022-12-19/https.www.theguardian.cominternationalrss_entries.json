It\u2019s a noticeably different version of the song to the one that appears on their eponymous 1979 debut album. The intro is long and slow, reflecting songwriter Jerry Dammers\u2019 increasing interest in jazz and easy listening, which would controversially infect the Specials\u2019 second album More Specials. Then the song erupts into frantic ska and the band\u2019s members suddenly spring into life, leaping up and down, rushing backwards and forwards across the stage. Except for Terry Hall, who continues to stand more or less stock still, his face impassive, an occasional nod his solitary concession to what\u2019s happening around him. As the song progresses, audience members start to climb on stage and dance, swamping the band. Dammers gleefully dives into their midst, but Hall has retreated to the rear of the stage, by the drums. He keeps singing about the awfulness of provincial nightlife \u2013 \u201cIs this the place to be? What am I doing here?\u201d \u2013 while staring balefully at the mayhem before him. The song ends and the screen goes black as Hall emits a mirthless laugh.</p><p>It was a very Terry Hall moment. Everyone remembers the Specials in their prime as a thrilling mass of cartoonish kinetic energy \u2013 when the comedy show Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News hamfistedly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnpY2vCwvU0\">attempted to parody</a> them, it was with a song called I Like Bouncing \u2013 but Hall was invariably the eye of the storm: he might occasionally move in time to the music (and at one point in Dance Craze he climbs down from the stage and sings directly into the rowdy front row) but in comparison with his bandmates, he was a statue, fixing the crowd or the viewer at home with an unblinking, mournful stare.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/19/terry-hall-the-self-assured-eye-of-the-specials-storm\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/19/trump-criminal-charges-jan-6-panel-capitol-attack", "title": "House January 6 panel recommends criminal charges against Donald Trump", "date_published": "2022-12-19 22:41:26+00:00", "description": "<p>The referral marks the first time in US history that Congress has taken such action against a former president</p><p>The January 6 committee has referred Donald Trump to the justice department to face criminal charges, accusing the former president of fomenting an insurrection and conspiring against the government over his attempt to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election, and the bloody attack on the US Capitol.</p><p>The committee\u2019s referrals approved by its members on Monday are the first time in American history that Congress has recommended charges against a former president.

Necking raw egg, albeit sweetened and mixed with cream, is something you can probably only do if you\u2019ve been brought up in a very specific culture (or you happen to be on an absurd protein kick). Things get even less appealing when alcohol is involved, as eggnog often comes spiked with some amount of brown spirit, because then it becomes a hellish hybrid of booze and hangover cure in one. But maybe nog newcomers are going in too hot. After all, what is eggnog if not a weird sort of custard? And what is custard, if not a woefully underused recipe ingredient? That\u2019s right: forget about drinking eggnog. This year I want you to eat it.

Each time I take part in the count, I turn out the light for a moment inside the darkness of the mountain to experience the unique sensation of stillness. I\u2019ve started to try to bring that experience with me out of the mine and into my everyday life. Whenever I get the chance, I switch off for a little while and sit in the dark. In an armchair, in the garden, or in the forest. It\u2019s rare that the darkness is as dense and compact as it is in the underworld of the mine passages, but a dark room or an unlit forest path grants the same kind of rest. Darkness is a pause from the constant flood of impressions, it\u2019s a visual silence \u2013 and a sort of primitive experience \u2013 in the otherwise too well-illuminated modern world.</p><p>For bats, darkness isn\u2019t a form of respite: it\u2019s essential. This animal, which has looked roughly the same for at least 55 million years, has always been nocturnal. None of the 1,400 bat species alive today have acclimatised to the brightest hours of daytime. Darkness is their security, and their senses are formed accordingly. For humans, it\u2019s the opposite: we\u2019re a highly diurnal animal, dependent on sense impressions; light is our safety. Being afraid of the dark is woven deep within our genetic and cultural inheritance and it isn\u2019t strange that today we light up the gardens of our houses, industrial areas and carparks. Humanity has extended the day past dusk and into the night, all the while squeezing out those that seek the darkest corners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/19/the-big-idea-why-we-need-to-make-the-world-a-darker-place\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/19/the-football-daily-christmas-awards-2022", "title": "The Football Daily Christmas Awards 2022", "date_published": "2022-12-19 12:29:46+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/05/the-fiver-email-sign-up\">Give the one you love something special this year: a free subscription to Football Daily.
