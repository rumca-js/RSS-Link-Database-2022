It’s a time for happiness, joy, self-reflection, and growth--and usually a little too much sugar but that’s what time off is for. But all those sweeping and wonderous emotions often come packed like a snowball with a flurry of stress, sleep deprivation, and not nearly enough time for rest.</p><p dir="ltr">This has been a busy year, and that’s beginning to become an evergreen statement for us all, collectively as a world. And so it’s important that everyone remember to take some time away for you and the people that are important to you. But just because you’re going to be surrounded by others, or maybe by yourself, doesn’t mean you can keep it festive while you’re resting.</p><p dir="ltr">Make some space for quiet this holiday season, not just for reflection and introspection, but for yourself with the sound of a crackling fire to soothe you. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/26-hbo-max-original-shows-and-movies-pulled-from-the-service/2900-4288/">HBO Max</a>, Netflix, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-horror-movies-on-shudder-that-are-dying-to-be-watched-this-halloween/2900-4398/">Shudder</a> all make it easy to celebrate the things you love with some creative and interesting yule logs ready to stream whenever you're ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Yule be sure to log these too, as we’ve carefully selected just a few of the best across the many that are available. And we’ve got the most fun and probably weirdest surprise from HBO Max’s Adult Swim Yule Log up first and ready to burn.</p><p dir="ltr">And a nice, festive fire always pairs nicely with pixelated cheer, so when you’re done burning one over here, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/winter-wonderlands-11-fun-video-games-set-during-christmas/2900-4509/">GameSpot’s got a list of snowy, seasonal games too</a>. And if things feel too happy, you can always invite Krampus and more over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/8-holiday-horror-movies-to-terrify-you-during-the-christmas-season/2900-4538/">from our list of holiday horror</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Adult Swim Yule Log</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4079138-adult-swim-yule-log.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the weirdest entry on this list but most definitely the only one with a plot. That’s right, the Adult Swim Yule Log had a lot of time in the kitchen with the energy of Too Many Cooks. That last part isn’t part of the metaphor. Adult Swim Yule Log was put together from the people that made Too Many Cooks, an Adult Swim fever dream sensation from the mid 2010s.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place in front of and within the room of the fireplace, Adult Swim Yule Log (aka The Fireplace) has a full story with dialogue, characters, and actors. Whether or not it becomes a recurring holiday favorite for the streaming age remains to be seen but one thing is for sure: Adult Swim Yule Log is creative and weird, but ambitious if nothing else. Be sure to check it out on HBO Max this holiday season, if for no reason to see what you think of what must be the first of its kind.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="[Various] Sign up for HBO Max">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1591/15918215/3807477-hbomax.jpg" />                                 <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">Sign up for HBO Max</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">Gain access to original shows and movies for $15/month</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">See more at HBO Max</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2.

This must be what it’s like to sit inside of a house or tavern inside of the show.</p><p>The Game of Thrones Fireplace lasts for over three hours, so it’ll burn long into the night without you or guests needing to add anymore logs. And so you don't have to, we did skip to the end though and can confirm the wiggly dragon egg does not hatch.

The magical fire is what powers the tall, magical, and moving castle in Studio Ghibli’s classic, Howl’s Moving Castle.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few different views in this feature, pulled straight from the film, for better or worse. Some segments work really well, with Calcifer burning brightly and silently, with a fire crackling sound playing underneath. But there are several minutes of footage where Calcifer is talking to a character offscreen and it’s just awkwardly muted.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s a curious decision when there’s plenty of footage shown that works better, that is shown as well. It’s still cute and functions just fine. The editing curiously feels sloppy and like a YouTube fan edit, instead of something officially available on HBO Max.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="[Various] Sign up for HBO Max">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1591/15918215/3807477-hbomax.jpg" />                                 <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">Sign up for HBO Max</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">Gain access to original shows and movies for $15/month</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://cnetpartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?aff_id=1&amp;offer_id=1&amp;aff_sub=[subid_value]&amp;url=https://www.hbomax.com/">See more at HBO Max</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4.

The fire should also help keep the hearts of Witcher fans warm alongside the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-cross-saves-and-cross-progression-explained/1100-6509998/">new PS5/Xbox Series update</a>, which was recently released for free to owners of The Witch III: Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red’s critically-acclaimed masterpiece.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7.

If you’re looking for a classic, standard fire, without having to lift a finger, except to reach for the remote, it’s perfect. Rick, Morty, and boring eggs that definitely could have hatched after three hours and ten minutes of wiggling are cool but nothing can compete with a classic, Christmas fire.</p><p dir="ltr">The Classic Edition contains original wood but Netflix has lovers of Birchwood covered too, with Fireplace for your Home: Birchwood Edition. Either way, you’re still going to want to have a blanket though since none of these fires are warm. Certainly not warm enough to hatch a dragon egg.</p></h3></p><br />

## Steven Spielberg Regrets Jaws Playing A Role In The "Decimation" Of Shark Populations

<p>Steven Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws tells a story about a shark that is out for vengeance. It hunts down and kills people. This doesn't happen in real life, but the film's negative depiction of sharks seemingly played a role in the rush in sportfishing for the mighty creatures, and it's something that Spielberg regrets.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001g8m4">BBC</a>, Spielberg said he is sorry for playing a role in the "decimation" of shark populations due to the film, and the book it was based on.</p><p>"That's one of the things I still fear--not to get eaten by a shark, but that sharks are somehow mad at me for the feeding frenzy of crazy sport fisherman that happened after 1975, which I truly, and to this day, regret the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film," he said, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jaws-steven-spielberg-regrets-decimation-sharks-1235284344/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.

## Producers Says Margot Robbie's Pirates Of The Caribbean Movie Isn't Dead Yet

<p>Jerry Bruckheimer is a legendary producer who has been behind some of the biggest movies of all time, including Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack has been since made a Disney icon, even being included in the Pirates ride at Disney theme parks, the first new addition to the ride in decades. </p><p>With Depp stating he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/johnny-depp-is-done-with-pirates-of-the-caribbean-for-good/1100-6502704/">hanging up the captain's hat for good</a>, there's a lot of speculation of where the franchise can go from here. There was a Margot Robbie-led Pirates movie, but there are conflicting reports on the status of that production with Robbie herself saying it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/margot-robbies-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movie-is-not-going-forward-she-says/1100-6509115/">not moving forward</a>, but it also may <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/margot-robbies-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movie-script-may-not-be-dead-just-yet/1100-6509675/">not be dead in the water</a>. Bruckheimer wanted to set the record straight. </p><p>"I think we're getting very close on that one, too. We have a very good script. We developed two of them," Bruckheimer explained to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/jerry-bruckheimer-interview-career-top-gun-maverick-sequels-1235282900/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "The one with Margot Robbie and one with a younger cast. The Margot Robbie one needs a little more work. The younger cast one is close. Hopefully, we'll get both of them."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/producers-says-margot-robbies-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movie-isnt-dead-yet/1100-6510174/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Amazon Studios' Lord of the Rings TV series, The Rings of Power, is making a big change for Season 2, with Adar actor Joseph Mawle (Game of Thrones) dropping out. Amazon Studios boss Vernon Sanders discussed this shakeup, what's on tap for Season 3, and more in a new interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/lotr-the-rings-of-power-amazon-vernon-sanders-interview-investment-season-2-spoilers-pace-battles-season-3-renewal-1235201384/">Deadline</a>.</p><p>Regarding Mawle's departure from The Rings of Power, Sanders simply said, "Unfortunately, it didn't work out."</p><p>"Joseph was tremendous and gave an incredible performance. The character of Adar in Season 2 has some really exciting dynamic things to play," Sanders said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-boss-talks-lotr-rings-of-power-losing-game-of-thrones-actor-and-how-show-has-more-than-paid-off/1100-6510170/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The DC Extended Universe was riddled with problems for almost a decade, with director Zack Snyder's polarizing take on Superman, the less-than-promising box office receipts (outside James Wan's Aquaman and Patty Jenkins' first Wonder Woman film), and inner-turmoil controversies with Joss Whedon, Ezra Miller, and harassment from Snyder's own fanbase to studio executives, even after the Snydercut Justice League was produced.</p><p>Last week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">Henry Cavill would not reprise his role as Superman</a> going forward in Gunn and Peter Safran's all-new DCEU and setting off a wildfire of backlash that resulted in the hashtag "#fireJamesGunn" trending for almost two days. Gunn understood that this would happen and addressed his fans, and DC movie fans as well, about how he sees the choices that were made as very difficult but did what was best for the characters.</p><p>"One of the things Peter and I were aware of when we took the job of heads of DC Studios was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fake-accounts-were-behind-the-snydercut-push-report/1100-6505608/">certain minority of people online</a> that could be, well, uproarious and unkind to say the least," Gunn posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/james.gunn.509994">social media</a>. "Our choices for the DCU are based upon what we believe is best for the story and best for the DC characters who have been around for 85 years."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-tells-fans-hard-choices-had-to-be-made-for-dc-reboot/1100-6510171/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns/">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a> puts an XCOM spin on superhero combat, combined with a semi-open-world area to explore when your team isn't actively trying to take down Hydra. The open base of operations is full of secrets to find and hidden pathways to unlock. You'll need to obtain four <strong>Words of Power</strong>--Open, Reveal, Purify, and Break--to open up those closed paths, so here's how to get them all.</p><h2>All Words of Power Locations</h2><h3>Open</h3><p>The first Word of Power opens closed doors around the Abbey and its surrounding forest. It's given to you through story progression, so you won't have to worry about finding it. Early on in the game, a quest will automatically start when you're forced to visit Agatha's shrine. The short quest will take you to a Blood Gate. Interact with the gate to start an easy fight that your demon dog Charlie will help with.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4076745-marvel%27smidnightsunsscreenshot2022.12.03-22.43.24.59.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4076745-marvel%27smidnightsunsscreenshot2022.12.03-22.43.24.59.jpg" /></a></figure><p>After the fight, you'll receive the first of <strong>four Moon Seals</strong>, which will give you the ability to use Open in the forest around the Abbey.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-how-to-get-all-words-of-power/1100-6510017/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Still, for the best look at what 2023 PC games are coming, this list has you covered with a bit of everything.</p><p>From long-awaited sequels, to genre-bending new IP, to exciting remakes and reboots built from the ground up, here are the most anticipated PC games for 2023 and beyond.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alan Wake 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079032-3916452-alanwake2site.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Speaking of unlikely sequels, Alan Wake 2 is a game for which fans have been clamoring for over a decade. The cult classic got a semi-sequel in 2012, but not until Remedy confirmed the existence of the Remedy Connected Universe (RCU) and openly admit that Control and Alan Wake take place in the same universe did the wheels start moving again publicly. For the Finnish studio, the sequel is the fulfillment of a promise 13 years in the making.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079028-4033740-acmirage.jpg" /><br /><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em><br /><h3><p>If recent Assassin's Creed games have gotten too big for your enjoyment, don't worry. Mirage may be the salve you've been seeking. Said to play more like early Assassin's Creed games, such as those starring Altair and Ezio, Mirage is not the 100-hour RPG that Ubisoft has been turning this series into for the past six years. It could even be nostalgic for some players.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Avowed</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913931-avowed.png" /><br /><h3><p>One of the games that developer Obsidian Entertainment has up its sleeve is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/">Avowed</a>, and it's intriguing considering the studio's track record (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds/">The Outer Worlds</a>). Avowed looks to be the first big RPG from Obsidian under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella, but all we know so far comes from the short teaser trailer shown off during the Xbox showcase from July 2020, which revealed it as a new first-person fantasy RPG set in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Baldur's Gate III</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1581/15811374/3612521-baldur%27s%20gate%203.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After proving its RPG mettle with the Divinity: Original Sin games, Larian Studios is making a true and proper sequel to the series that inspired it. Baldur's Gate 3 follows the events of Shadows of Amn and takes notes from both the classic Baldur's Gate games and the Divinity franchise. An early access version was released in 2020, and despite some rough spots, it showed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review/1900-6417601/">a great deal of promise</a>. It's currently slated for a full release in 2022.</p><p>Release date: August 2023</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Company of Heroes 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913932-company.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The World War 2 real-time strategy series Company of Heroes is coming back after a long hiatus. This time the game will focus on the Italian and North African theaters of war, and includes new features like a Tactical Pause that allows you to queue up commands and increased destructibility. An alpha test conducted in late 2021 helped prepare tacticians for the battle to come, but we don't expect to see the full game released until late 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dead Island 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079029-4025401-dead.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Dead Island 2 is a game that once looked unlikely to exist at all. After shuffling around from studio to studio, it's finally nearly here as the next game from Dambuster Studios (Homefront: Revolution). The sequel moves to LA (or HELL-A, as the trailers say), and though that isn't an island, the series' penchant for gory dark humor is alive and well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079031-4044210-gsdeadspacepreorder.png" /><br /><em>Dead Space</em><br /><h3><p>Often lauded as one of the best horror games of its generation, if not ever, Dead Space is getting the remake treatment other recent horror games have seen. From what we've seen, it's set to be a faithful recreation that still includes some smart streamlining for a 2023 audience. Get ready to "cut off their limbs" all over again.</p><p>Release date: January 27, 2023</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo IV</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1581/15811374/3612522-diablo%204.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After years of post-launch support for Diablo 3, Blizzard is finally putting out a proper sequel with Diablo 4--but it's been a long time coming, and it may be longer still. The studio known for its "polish it until it's perfect" approach has hesitated to put a date on Diablo 4, and so far has only shown off small snippets of the development process as it keeps fans informed of its progress. Now the studio is dealing with ongoing legal action that has led to some creative departures, which could impact development still. Previously planned for 2022, it has been pushed back, meaning we won't see it until at least April 2023. That's still a long time to wait, but we could also at least start to see more of the game shaping up as we get closer to its release.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest change is Blizzard's focus on making Diablo IV feel a bit more like a live-service game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-feels-like-a-demonic-destiny-thanks-to-it/1100-6471114/">Its overworld will be public</a>, and you can expect to run into other characters as you wander the wilds and engage enemies. There will even be public events and world bosses to defeat with the help of strangers. Dungeons will still be instanced for you and your party, but the inclusion of other players in the short demo we tried at BlizzCon made Sanctuary feel more like a living world beset by evil than in past titles. The only trouble is, we have no idea when Blizzard means to release Diablo IV--and by all accounts, it doesn't sound like it'll be in players' hands anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: TBA</strong></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Elder Scrolls 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1581/15811374/3612523-elder%20scrolls%206.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">All we know about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> is that it's real and it's being worked on. We got a short teaser trailer with a title, and that's it. Here we are patiently waiting. Maybe we'll get another Skyrim remaster for new-gen consoles and PC in the meantime.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Everwild</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913933-everwild.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everwild/">Everwild</a> is a brand-new IP from Rare, and looks to be an adventurous game set in an expansive outdoors with a stunning art style. While we don't know exactly what to expect from Everwild, it seems like a marriage between the natural and supernatural world with interactions revolving around wildlife and your party of four, which is teased in its reveal trailer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fable</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913934-fable.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There is very little we know about the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable/">Fable</a> right now, but at least we know it's real. Its reveal concluded the Xbox Showcase back in July 2020 and confirmed that developer Playground Games is behind the project. Fable is an RPG series known for its take on choice and consequence, and how they affect the way your character looks, grows, and is perceived in the game world. It's exciting to think about what Fable could be in this new generation.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Forspoken</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913971-3770592-3713048-projectathia.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Forspoken (previously Project Athia) is a new fantasy action game from Square Enix with a fish-out-of-water story at its core. A regular girl from our world is pulled into a fantastic setting complete with dragons, and in doing so she gains her own supernatural abilities to ward off evil.</p><p>Release date: January 24, 2023</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hogwarts Legacy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913935-hogwarts.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> is the much-anticipated action RPG set in the Harry Potter universe, but in this adventure in the Wizarding World, we don't need Harry. The story takes place in the late 1800s, but all the things you know and love about the franchise are still here: spells, potions, magical beasts, and the house rivalries of Hogwarts. J.K. Rowling isn't directly involved in the project--take that for what you will.</p><p dir="ltr">Release date: February 10, 2023</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Homeworld 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913936-homeworld3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Gearbox's revival of the Homeworld franchise is markedly more connected to fan feedback than most. As a crowdfunded campaign, the studio invited surveys from investors on what elements or aspects of the original Homeworld games were most important to them. The project has brought on some key personnel from the original development studio, and studio Blackbird Interactive cut its teeth on the Homeworld Remastered Collection. It's due out in late 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Last of Us Part 1</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079025-3988687-sgf_lastofus_20220609_site.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Last of Us originally released in 2013. Now, 10 years and two remasters later, it's finally coming to PC. The move was expected, though still not guaranteed, given Sony's more recent interest in bringing its prestigious first-party games to PC. For players who have managed to avoid spoilers for all these years, you're in for a treat. And by treat, we mean an emotionally devastating roller coaster.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lord of the Rings: Gollum</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913938-lordoftherings.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Listen, I'm not sure who wanted a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum/">Lord of the Rings game starring Gollum</a>, but we'll give it a chance, of course. If you check the Steam page, the release date is marked as "Lurking until the time is right." We respect that.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mass Effect</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079039-3789993-masseffectlegendary.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>That's right; a new Mass Effect is coming. Announced at The Game Awards 2020, the upcoming entry in the fan-favorite series still seems to be early in development, with Bioware at the helm. With only a teaser to go by, very little is known about the game. Many speculate that it may more directly tie into the original trilogy than continue from where Mass Effect: Andromeda left off. No release date has been confirmed, but if it's anything like the Dragon Age game in development, then it's likely still a while out.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Minecraft Legends</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079034-875618_front.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Not a ton is known about Minecraft Legends right now, but the prospect of the beloved survival sandbox series migrating into a new genre is exciting. It's even more exciting when you consider the last similar effort, Minecraft Dungeons, was a neat entry into the action-RPG space, offering up a Diablo-lite experience for the often-younger Minecraft audience. Legends is said to be a strategy game, and that can mean different things, but for now we're intrigued.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913956-prince.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> first came out in 2003 and turned the series into a 3D action platformer. In a way, it also established the framework for parkour gameplay elements we've seen throughout Ubisoft's games since then. The remake was shown in action through its reveal trailer and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed/1100-6485234/">just recently pushed slightly back</a> to March 2021.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913942-stalker.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a> has been slowly teased since 2018. Much like the rest of the series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 takes place in the Nuclear Exclusion Zone (or "The Zone") in radiated Chornobyl, but supernatural elements lurk about to create a horror-like atmosphere. It's said to have one of the biggest open worlds ever in games, which sounds pretty daunting to explore and ambitious for the first-person action franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Redfall</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913940-redfall.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of a spate of games centered around superpowered multiplayer heroes taking on hordes of monsters, Redfall catches our attention based heavily on the pedigree. Arkane Studios, the developer behind Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, certainly knows how to make games that relish in granting you superpowers, so having those skills put toward a cooperative game make it one to watch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil 4</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079030-3985331-re4.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>You can't mention horror games without Resident Evil 4, and amid an ongoing and highly successful Resi revitalization campaign from Capcom over the past several years comes the full remake of arguably its most beloved series entry to date. Leon, Ashley, and those unforgettable chainsaw-wielding killers are sure to look lovely in the RE Engine, even if we'll sometimes be running for our lives too much to notice.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Returnal</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079036-3824096-returnal-review.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Expect to see Playstation games come to PC more often going forward, and expect to see few of them look as mesmerizing as Returnal. This bullet hell third-person shooter brings Housemarque's trademark arcade gameplay into a more story-centric framework with strong Alien vibes. It's as gorgeous as it is unforgiving.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Senua Saga: Hellblade 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913951-senua.png" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> continues the harrowing journey of the titular protagonist that started in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/">Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</a>. Although we don't know much about the next of this sequel, it was revealed alongside the Xbox Series X in 2019 with a cinematic trailer, and it's one of the major upcoming games from Ninja Theory, which is now under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Citizen</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913955-starcitizen.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">At this point, Star Citizen is most famous for raising an incredible amount of money. After ending its Kickstarter campaign 2012, developer Cloud Imperium continued raising money through crowdfunding and release of purchasable modules that are said to eventually be operable within the game itself. It currently sits at more than $400 million raised, with no official release date for the commercial product. Though some playable slices have been available, the uncertainty around a release has made it a hotbed of controversy. It's almost certainly not coming in 2022. But as an ongoing project that could make a big splash when or if it materializes, lots of people are looking forward to their virtual voyage among the stars.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Starfield</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913963-starfield.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the big hitters in development at Bethesda is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>, which seems to be sci-fi space-themed take on the studio's RPGs. Not much, if anything, is known about Starfield gameplay-wise other than it's said to have a major game engine overhaul. Todd Howard has spoken about it in vague terms, too, and mentioned we'll see it before The Elder Scrolls VI.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913947-suicide.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Rocksteady helped create one of the all-time great superhero franchises with Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels, and now it's returning to the world with a take on the antihero troupe Suicide Squad with Kill the Justice League. We haven't seen much from the game aside from a teaser, but we know that it centers around the four title characters--Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and King Shark--taking on brainwashed superheroes like Superman and The Flash. It's set in the same universe as the Arkham games but takes place in Metropolis instead, so we'll get a very different view of the world Rocksteady created.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>System Shock</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913948-system.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most revered first-person shooters of all time is getting a remake this year. System Shock was a major inspiration for later hits like BioShock, and after a successful Kickstarter campaign, Night Dive Studios is bringing it back. What originally began as a remaster has morphed into a full-on reboot. An early alpha version was released in May 2020, and now the wait is on for more details. Night Dive has run into development troubles related to the pandemic and other factors, but the game is said to be coming in 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079027-download%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Who will survive and what will be left of them? The famous tagline of the 1974 movie will soon be something you and your friends must ask yourselves as Gun Media is adapting the all-time horror classic into a smart and scary asymmetrical multiplayer game. Just the sound of the chainsaw alone gives us goosebumps.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Total War Warhammer 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/3913949-totalwar.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Creative Assembly has built up a reputation for itself with top-tier expertise in real-time strategy. That makes its return to the Warhammer universe with Total War Warhammer 3 an exciting treat for fans who have been waiting for a proper sequel since 2017. As usual for the Total War franchise, you'll have to engage in careful diplomacy and all-out battle to navigate the campaign. Owning the first two games will unlock their races in multiplayer, and a new set of factions include the Kislev and Grand Cathay human civilizations, and four based on Warhammer's Chaos Gods. It's coming on February 17, 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3533556-screenshot-slider-17.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is such a fascinating concept considering the cult status of the original games from 2000 and 2004. It's a first-person RPG set in the same World of Darkness universe as its tabletop RPG source material, but in a modern-day Seattle, and it looks to build on what the Bloodlines did in 2004.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Wolf Among Us 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4079026-3614602-trailer_wolfamongus_20191212.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The continuing story of Bigby Wolf seemed lost to time when Telltale Games was shuttered in 2018, but with the studio reborn for a new era--thankfully alongside a new game engine--our neo-noirish fantasy vibes are back in play. It's been so long that this sequel may wind up feeling like a reboot, but in any event, we're just glad to be huffing and puffing as the Big Bad Wolf again soon.</p></h3></p><br />

## Final Fantasy 7 Remake Buster Sword Controller Isn't Practical, But Is Extremely Cool

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> can now be played with a Buster Sword controller, thanks to the ingenuity of controller-making maestro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64/about">Super Louis 64</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video uploaded to <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperLouis_64/status/1603601560956801024?s=20&amp;t=zslmnFQmBEH-OkNGph_-jg">Twitter</a> over the weekend, Louis shows how his latest controller build can detect inputs like slashes, guards, and thrusts while battling some of the game's early Shinra guard enemies. The only problem is thrusting and swinging a giant, heavy sword to play a video game isn't exactly practical, but that's not exactly the point. Even if Louis looks worn out after testing out the controller weapon, it's still cool to see it in action and just goes to show how fantastical it is that Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife can swing around the massive piece of steel for hours like it's no problem.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">It's done, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FF7R?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#FF7R</a> is now fully playable with an actual BUSTER SWORD!

His most recent project has been working on making specific controllers for each of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/">Final Fantasy XIV's</a> classes. That quest recently saw him create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BTcSPZS1is">book controller</a> in order to play the MMORPG's Scholar class, where scribbling in the book in real life allows him to cast spells in-game. When asked when he was going to craft a controller for FFXIV's Dark Knight class, Louis on Twitter says he may have had an "ulterior motive" in making the Buster Sword controller first.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-buster-sword-controller-isnt-practical-but-is-extremely-cool/1100-6510165/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The year's almost over, but Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are getting at least one more raid before the calendar turns. As reported by <a href="https://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml">Serebii</a>, the last 2022 raid for the game is a seven-star Tera Raid Battle that will let trainers fight and catch a Cinderace.</p><p dir="ltr">As you might expect, Cinderace isn't catchable in either game in any form, so players who are looking to fill out their PokeDex as much as possible will definitely want to check it out. Though Cinderace is usually a fire-type Pokemon, this special raid Cinderace will be of the special Fighting Tera type, and will have a Mightiest Mark to show that it was caught during the raid.</p><p dir="ltr">The seven-star Cinderace Tera Raid Battle will be available during two different time periods. The first begins at December 29 at 7 PM ET / 4 PM PT and will continue until December 31 at 7 PM ET / 4 PM PT. The second will run from January 12 at 7 PM ET / 4 PM PT until January 14 at 7 PM ET / 4 PM PT. This may be your only chance to catch a Cinderace during this generation, so don't delay.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-violet-has-a-cinderace-raid-on-the-way/1100-6510164/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Footage from Assassin's Creed Jade, an upcoming mobile game set in China, appears to have leaked. The video shows traversal and combat, in what appears to be one of the game's early sections.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-assassins-creed-codename-jade-gameplay-appears-online/">VGC</a>, the footage leaked on Reddit and appears to be from an early build. The gameplay, recorded from an iPhone, occasionally displays watermarks that disclaim, "This is an early version of the game and does not represent the final quality of the product." The leaked footage seems to be from the game's opening, tutorial sections. It shows a character leaping across a section of the Great Wall of China, as a village beyond it is under assault by the Xiongnu army. Touchscreen controls are visible, but the interface and gameplay is generally similar to recent console Assassin's Creed games on console, complete with a minimap, objective markers, and light/heavy attacks.</p><div><blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/zpgb96/assassins_creed_jade_game_leak/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Assassin's creed: Jade game leak</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/">assassinscreed</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In Jade, players will create their own characters, rather than see the return of Assassin's Creed Chronicles protagonist Shao Jun.

<p dir="ltr">While the next James Bond has yet to be named, the man who most recently played him says he was thinking about killing off the suave British spy as early as 2006. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Daniel Craig looked back at the road to leaving the character behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Don't read ahead if you want to avoid spoilers for Craig's final film in the Bond franchise, 2021's No Time To Die.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked by BBC Radio 4's Martha Kearney whether Craig had any regrets with his Bond being killed off at the end, Craig said (via <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/global/daniel-craig-james-bond-death-1235463337/">Variety</a>), "No, none at all… I had an incredibly fortunate 17 years of my life making this.

<p dir="ltr">Hard to believe, but 2022 is nearly behind us. As we're all headed off for a rejuvenating holiday break, Prime Video has given us more reasons to look forward to 2023 with its full list of new shows and movies on the platform. Some of that content will be available on January 1, while other shows and movies will be available a little later next month. For more, check out our similar January 2023 rundowns for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-hulu-in-january-2023-how-i-met-your-father-season-2-the-drop/1100-6510137/">Hulu</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-disney-plus-in-january-2023-star-wars-the-bad-batch-willow/1100-6510155/">Disney+</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On January 13, the quirky Nazi-hunting show The Hunt from writer-director Jordan Peele will return for its second and final season. Peele executive produces the series, in collaboration with creator David Weil (The Twilight Zone). The show, which was the TV debut of Al Pacino, debuted back in 2020. Hunters follows an eclectic group of Nazi hunters in 1977 New York, and wades deeply into a number of wild conspiracies and explorations of revenge fantasies. All eight episodes of the final season drop on January 13.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">For something completely different, Shotgun Wedding is worth a shot (no pun intended), especially if you're a White Lotus fan itching to see more of Jennifer Coolidge wielding a gun. Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel star in a movie that sees their character's families coming together for "the ultimate destination wedding, just as the couple begin to get cold feet. And if that wasn't enough of a threat to the celebration, suddenly everyone’s lives are in danger when the entire party is taken hostage."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-amazon-prime-video-in-january-2023-hunters-season-2-shotgun-wedding/1100-6510158/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nvidia Removing GameStream Support From Shield Devices

<p dir="ltr">Nvidia Shield device owners have enjoyed the platform's PC streaming capabilities for years now, but that's set to change. The GameStream feature--which allows users to stream PC games on Shield TVs and tablets in 4K--will be removed from Shield devices in mid-February.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5436">a post</a> from Nvidia, users who don't install the update will not have access to many Shield features, including the GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Nvidia also says that GameStream will stop working at some point in the future even for those die-hards.</p><p dir="ltr">The company recommends that consumers use Steam Link instead, which requires users to download an app. Nvidia also recommends GeForce Now as a possible option, though it requires a monthly fee for 4K streaming. It's not clear why Nvidia has decided to end support for this service, but the fact that they're explicitly pushing users towards a pay subscription model as an alternative arguably speaks for itself.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-removing-gamestream-support-from-shield-devices/1100-6510156/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But for every blockbuster like Elden Ring or God Of War: Ragnarok taking center stage, there are thousands of smaller games waiting in the wings that are just as worthy of attention in their own way. From pizza delivery spies and deck-building relationships to sword-wielding spiders and books about plants, 2022 offered countless weird and wonderful games that thrived outside the mainstream.</p><p dir="ltr">We've rounded up 20 of the best games from independent developers and boutique publishers, all of them released this year across a staggering range of genres and on various platforms from PC to all major consoles and even mobile, that we feel deserve a little extra time in the spotlight. Indeed, 2022's bench was so deep that only one of these games made it onto any of our other Best Of lists. We simply had to find a way to spread the love even further.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Beacon Pines</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076415-beaconpines.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Hiding Spot</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Fellow Traveller</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch, Xbox</p><p dir="ltr">Beacon Pines is a novel reimagining of the choose-your-own-adventure formula where the malleable story doesn't so much branch as split into multiple versions of itself, each one potentially twisting back in time to recontextualize earlier events. The adorable children's illustrated storybook presentation belies a surprisingly sinister tone where the cute deer and fox pair of protagonists frequently meet with death.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Betrayal at Club Low</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076416-betrayalatclublow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Betrayal at Club Low</p><p dir="ltr">Developer: Cosmo D</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Cosmo D</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">From the developer of Tales From Off-Peak City comes a similarly unhinged espionage adventure where you go undercover as a pizza delivery man attempting to extract a compromised fellow agent from a ludicrous nightclub. Imagine Hitman but played as a role-playing game where the success of your chosen actions is determined by dice rolls against your skills of deception, observation or, um, cooking.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Case of the Golden Idol</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076417-thecaseofthegoldenidol.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Developer: Color Gray Games</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Playstack</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">An ingenious detective adventure, The Case of the Golden Idol takes the classic Clue framing ("It was [so-and-so] with the [murder weapon] in the [specific location]") and demands you fill in the blanks to solve a series of increasingly fiendish murder mysteries. While the visual aesthetic may require some acclimating, the labyrinthine design--part Return of the Obra Dinn, part classic point &amp; click adventure--is whipsmart and immediately fascinating.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076418-deadeyedeepfake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: nodayshalleraseyou</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: nodayshalleraseyou</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">The mysterious solo developer who goes only by the name nodayshalleraseyou promises that their debut game is all style and no substance. This is nonsense. Beyond the exquisitely minimal presentation mimicking a CRT display from some high-res alternate history 1980s, Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum is a deep and intelligent immersive sim, a kind of top-down take on Deus Ex mixed with Tom Francis' Gunpoint and Heat Signature.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dorfromantik</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076419-dorfromantik.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Toukana Interactive</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Toukana Interactive</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch</p><p dir="ltr">From the German "dorf" meaning village, Dorfromantik is a beguiling puzzle game about constructing idyllic hamlets across the sprawling European countryside. Tiles appear at random and can only be placed next to other tiles, with adjacency bonuses for pairing like terrain types boosting your score. There's a high-score challenge, but much of the enjoyment comes from making a lovely little place, so much so the developers added a stress-free Creative Mode for the full release this year. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dread Delusion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076422-dreaddelusion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Developer: Lovely Hellplace</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Dread XP</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding to the Elder Scrolls with its setup--you begin as a prisoner recently released and now free to explore a large open world--Dread Delusion has something of a selective memory when it comes to drawing inspiration from '90s PC RPGs. It relishes the weird and wonderful, borrowing the bits that linger in the memory because there was always something odd about them. Also, it refers to experience points as "delusions," which is itself a mystery you must get to the bottom of.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076423-theexcavationofhobsbarrow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Developer: Cloak and Dagger Games</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Wadjet Eye Games</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">Folk horror is fertile ground for games, with its penchant for subterranean suspense and the collision of the fantastic and the mundane. A surprisingly tense adventure, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow certainly nails the atmosphere, as you get your hands dirty digging up its earthy layers of mystery as an antiques evaluator visiting a small village in the north of England.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Frog Detective 3: Corruption At Cowboy County</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076426-frogdetective3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Grace Bruxner, Thomas Bowker</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Worm Club</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">The third--perhaps final?--chapter in the Frog Detective series is as charmingly silly as ever with the titular detective assigned to crack the case of the missing (cowboy) hats in Cowboy County. Also, how do I put this… all the horses are missing and the cowboys have resorted to riding scooters instead. The puzzles are light and breezy, designed always with a view to making you smile rather than making you think, and the jokes have a hit-rate nearly as high as Frog Detective's own case clearance.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Islets</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076427-islets.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Kyle Thomson</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Armor Games</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox</p><p dir="ltr">While we wait… and wait… for the Hollow Knight sequel we ordered years ago to arrive, Islets proves to be a plentiful appetizer ahead of the main course. Despite a whimsical atmosphere buoyed by vibrant characters and a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, Islets still delivers an inventive platforming challenge as you backtrack to explore previously inaccessible areas and literally connect the world back together.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>I Was A Teenage Exocolonist</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076428-iwasateenageexocolonist.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Northway Games</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Finji</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch</p><p dir="ltr">Deck-building carries real emotional weight in this coming-of-age sci-fi story. Repeatedly live through a decade of the life of a teenager living on the fringes of the known universe; as you grow up, your deck grows in kind, new cards handing you new ways to deal with the challenges life in a far-flung colony throws your way. It's a relationship sim at heart, where the refreshingly progressive identity options allow you to play any card you like.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Mortuary Assistant</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076429-themortuaryassistant.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Darkstone Digital</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Dread XP</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">A first-person horror experience that combines the rigorous procedure of a detective investigation with the expectant terror of the creepiest jump-scare thriller, as you conduct autopsies while trapped inside the world's most demonically-possessed morgue. The Mortuary Assistant is indie horror at its finest, committed to one core concept and resolutely determined to explore it to its fullest–and most frightening.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>NeverAwake</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076432-neverawake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Developer: Neotro</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Phoenixx</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox</p><p dir="ltr">Neotro is a small Japanese studio whose name portmanteaus "neo" and "retro," a philosophy exemplified by this thoroughly modern take on the twin-stick shooter. NeverAwake is an unsettling yet cartoonish peek into the nightmares of a young girl in a coma, with her trauma manifested in waves of enemies in bullet-hell-style shoot-'em-up levels. The action is spectacular but the mood is often disturbing.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Patrick's Parabox</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076433-patricksparabox.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Patrick Traynor</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Patrick Traynor</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch</p><p dir="ltr">Patrick's Parabox may look like a simple box-pushing puzzle game, but its simple, uncluttered design hides layers of complexity. Infinite layers, in fact. Solo developer Patrick Traynor has posed a recursive series of brainteasers where boxes are pushed inside other boxes into yet more boxes and back into themselves. Impressively, it's delivered without fat, just screen after screen after screen of box cleverness.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prodeus</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076434-prodeus.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Developer: Bounding Box Software</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Humble Games</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox</p><p dir="ltr">From former Raven Software veterans, Prodeus is a leading light of the jokingly-named "boomer shooter" genre, reviving the breakneck-paced feel of '90s FPSs like Doom and Quake with the spectacular, FX-filled look of a modern shooter. Levels are designed first and foremost as combat arenas rather than real places, and the explosive action foregrounds improvisational skill rather than scripted set-pieces.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Roadwarden</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076436-roadwarden.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Moral Anxiety Studio</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Assemble Entertainment</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">A self-described "illustrated text-based RPG," Roadwarden is in some ways the most old-fashioned game on this list. Yet its sense of open-endedness, of letting you set your own goals, feels shockingly progressive. That pioneering attitude stems from the core concept: You're a scout, basically, exploring an uncharted land and reporting back. Exceptional writing and the growing realization there are countless story threads to unpick will encourage many a return journey.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>SpiderHeck</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076437-spiderheck.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Developer: Neverjam</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Tinybuild</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch</p><p dir="ltr">Though it features a single-player challenge mode and online play, SpiderHeck is best enjoyed in local multiplayer with several at least slightly competitive friends and a group of rowdy onlookers. Each player is a neon spider, slinging themselves across wireframe battle arenas, lobbing bombs, swinging laser swords, and blasting each other with rocket launchers. There's even an enjoyable co-op wave mode for when the competition gets overheated.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Strange Horticulture</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076438-strangehorticulture.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Bad Viking</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Iceberg Interactive</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps you wouldn't think that a game almost entirely about researching and identifying plants would be one of the year's best, but that element of leftfield novelty may well help explain why Strange Horticulture is so compelling. Every plant requested by your customers is a new case to crack and another opportunity to thumb through your beautifully illustrated book of botanical information to deduce the answer. It'll grow on you, trust me.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Taiji</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076439-taiji.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Developer: Matthew VanDevander</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Matthew VanDevander</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC</p><p dir="ltr">The influence of The Witness is obvious in this dazzling puzzle game set on a mysterious island, its curiously abandoned structures strewn with puzzle panels. Solutions are arrived at gradually, with each new panel ushering in greater complexity, wordlessly teaching you through an accumulation of incremental lessons. The riddle of the island's creation is the throughline, but it's the virtuosity of the puzzle chains that will hook you 'til the end.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wayward Strand</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076440-waywardstrand.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Ghost Pattern</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Ghost Pattern</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox</p><p dir="ltr">A hospital for elder care housed on an airborne zeppelin tethered off the coast of Melbourne is the unlikely setting for one of the year's sweetest stories. Teenager Casey has to tag along with her mother as she works a weekend shift at the hospital. But what starts as a grudging obligation transforms into a tender tale of maturing as Casey learns more about the patients and staff, their life stories intersecting in affecting ways with touching moments of humor and poignance.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wylde Flowers</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4076441-wyldeflowers.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Developer: Studio Drydock</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher: Studio Drydock</p><p dir="ltr">Platforms: PC, Switch, iOS</p><p dir="ltr">The farming life-sim is brewed with an extra dash of narrative intrigue in Wylde Flowers, a Stardew Valley-like where you play a young woman returning to her small island home town and quickly discovering that being a witch apparently runs in the family. There's a surprising amount of story to reveal in between all the potion-making, agriculture, mining, and inevitable romantic pursuits, all delivered by a delightfully charismatic and wholesome cast of characters.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

<p>Has there ever been a stunt that Tom Cruise didn't like? Hard to say, but the actor was back at it with a new promo video for Top Gun: Maverick in which he's shooting an airborne scene for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 and Part 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The special announcement video begins with Cruise hanging out of a helicopter, thanking audiences for going to the theaters and supporting Top Gun: Maverick.

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">The long-awaited follow-up to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally almost here. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (which had been informally known as Breath of the Wild 2) is coming in May 2023. That's not much longer to wait for the sequel to one of Nintendo's most beloved games. Even as close as we are, though, there's a lot we still don't know. Nintendo is notoriously secretive about its games before launch, and it seems especially inclined to keep this anticipated Zelda game under wraps.</p><p dir="ltr">That hasn't stopped fans from speculating, making some educated or at least interesting guesses about what might really be going on. In case you need a refresher, here's a primer on everything we know--and everything we suspect--about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-everything-we-know/1100-6492308/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Mission: Impossible movie franchise has been going strong for nearly 30 years, and the upcoming Dead Reckoning Part 1 and 2 are set to close the franchise with a bang. Cruise took to Twitter to thank his fans as he and his daredevil team of stunt experts go through what it takes to pull off a stunt that he has had in mind for years: a motorcycle jumps off into a cliff into a base jump.</p><p>Dead Reckoning has been long-delayed and actor/producer of the film, Tom Cruise, did not want the movie to hit streaming, a bet he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-i-wouldnt-let-top-gun-maverick-debut-on-streaming/1100-6503592/">similarly made for Top Gun: Maverick and one that paid off</a>. The film was partially filmed in Norway, where the stunt takes place, and director/producer Christopher McQuarrie along with Cruise talks us through the process of what all has to happen to make this particular stunt work. </p><p>"There's a lot going into this stunt," McQuarrie explains. "So Tom put together this master plan to coordinate with all these experts in each of the disciplines involved to make this whole thing happen."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-shows-off-absolutely-wild-stunt-hes-had-in-mind-for-mission-impossible-for-years/1100-6510143/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

It's notably not an actual game, but a portal through which players can enjoy multiple Assassin's Creed experiences. Frankly, it sounds a lot like Netflix or Xbox Games Pass, but solely for Assassin's Creed.

## Fable 4: Everything We Know

<p dir="ltr">The Fable series has been dormant since 2010, assuming you don't count Fable: The Journey, because no one does. But the series his coming back, with a new Fable coming from Playground Games, the studio behind the popular Forza Horizon series. Fable is a very different kind of game, but Playground is a talented studio that should bring something new to the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Fable was first announced with a mood teaser in May 2020. Unfortunately, we don't know much else about it yet. Below, we've run down all the details currently out there about Fable, which is often referred to as Fable 4, although we don't know if that number is reflective of where the game will fit in the franchise.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The teaser trailer</h2><p dir="ltr">Our first look at Fable didn't give any story or gameplay details, but it did certainly set a mood. The trailer showed off a fairy flitting her way through an idyllic fantasy forest, before suddenly getting eaten by a huge toad. That certainly sets the mood for the irreverent tone the Fable series is known for. And notably, the trailer simply refers to it as "Fable," indicating this could be a reboot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-4-everything-we-know/1100-6485774/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, Hogwarts Legacy is a single-player RPG where players get to experience life as a student at the esteemed wizarding school. The game is set in the 1800s, 100 or so years prior to the original book series, and has an original story created by the development team at Avalanche Software.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been many Harry Potter games made, from the old 3D platformers based on the early movies and the Lego games covering the entire series, but this is the first time an original story is being told in a full RPG. Hogwarts Legacy has also been surrounded by controversy since its announcement due to Harry Potter creator JK Rowling's comments on transgender issues.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">JK Rowling controversy</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="JK_Rowling_controversy">JK Rowling controversy</h2><p dir="ltr">While not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowling-is-not-directly-involved-with-harry-potter-game-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6482315/">directly involved with Hogwarts Legacy</a>, JK Rowling and her anti-transgender stance have plagued the game and everything related to Harry Potter. The developers took the unusual step of making it clear that Rowling had no direct involvement in Hogwarts Legacy. In its FAQ, WB stated, "J.K. Rowling is not directly involved in the creation of the game, however, her extraordinary body of writing is the foundation of all projects in the Wizarding World."

<p>For its next adventure, Bethesda is transcending the confines of Medieval prisons and retro bomb shelters to boldly go where, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-was-the-place-for-summer-game-fest-2022/1100-6504390/">as it turns out</a>, many games are going: space.

Game director Todd Howard said being able to focus exclusively on Xbox and PC is in the best interests of Starfield. However, he definitely hears and feels for PlayStation owners who won't be able to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">"You don't ever want to leave people out, right?" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-todd-howard-talks-exclusivity-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6492977/">Howard said back in June 2021</a>.

<p>It has been more than 15 years since the Nintendo Wii got Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, bringing a supposed end to Samus Aran's first-person adventures. However, Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017, instantly becoming one of the Nintendo Switch's most anticipated games despite fans only knowing the name and the logo. In the years since, we have heard very little about the game's progress, though we do know it was essentially restarted back in 2019 as development moved from one studio to another. But to paint a complete picture of what is public, here is what we know about Metroid Prime 4 so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Release date</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not revealed a release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4/">Metroid Prime 4</a>, simply stating that the game was "in development" during E3 2017 before later offering an apology for the wait back in 2019. During this second update, Nintendo's Shinya Takahashi said it would be missing its internal release target for the game, but since we don't know what that is, it's unclear when we can expect Metroid Prime 4. Nintendo's earnings reports continue to only list Metroid Prime 4's release as TBA.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What we know so far</h2><p dir="ltr">In the grand scheme of things, the real answer is "almost nothing," but there are a few things we've come to understand about Metroid Prime 4's development.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Rocksteady’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight, released in 2015, which means it has been seven years since we played a new Rocksteady game. In video game time, that is an eternity. As a four-player co-op shooter, Suicide Squad is a big departure from its previous single-player action games, but we’re excited to see the studio tackle something new… even if it is taking place in a familiar universe.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1755/17559665/3981849-squad.jpg"><img alt="Task Force X is either looking at a bird or a plane.
