  <p id="WzQqWL">Twitter has officially announced Blue for Business, a subscription geared toward companies that want to “verify and distinguish themselves on Twitter,” <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/twitter-blue-for-business.html">as its press release says</a>. The service will let companies link their main accounts with those of their employees to make it easier to show that someone actually does work for them.</p>
<p id="ZjgaN0">The company is testing the service with “a select group of businesses,” including its own employees. Esther Crawford, director of product management at Twitter, has a little bird badge next to her blue checkmark that verifies her as an employee at the company, as you can see in <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1604956453932236800">this tweet</a> of her announcing Blue for Business.

The new option is described as a native Tumblr streaming service powered by Livebox. (Livebox is operated by the Meet Group, a subsidiary of the dating app company ParshipMeet Group.)

  <p id="fFNMv9">Got your 2023 planner in hand? Good, because OnePlus wants you to save the date for its global flagship phone launch on February 7th. Dubbed Cloud 11, the event will take place in New Delhi and will debut the OnePlus 11 5G and OnePlus Buds Pro 2. </p>
<p id="VINJRV">A teaser image accompanying Monday’s news lines up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23349247/oneplus-11-pro-leaks-alert-slider-camera-redesign-features-rumors">previously</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23494862/oneplus-11-leak-alert-slider-camera-specs-launch">leaked</a> renders, showing a redesigned camera bump. Separately, company spokesperson Spenser Blank confirmed that a Hasselblad-branded camera system and the much-beloved alert slider will return on the OnePlus 11 — both features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23289302/oneplus-10t-review-specs-price-screen-fast-charging-camera">omitted from the OnePlus 10T</a>. </p>

  <p id="ZGb0ZM">The Nintendo Switch’s lousy performance is as enduring as the console itself. Grainy, stuttery graphics are synonymous with playing games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">on the 2017 system</a>, which hasn’t gotten a spec upgrade to boost how games look and run. And in the five-plus years since the Switch was released, remarking on disappointing visuals has been a fixture in our reviews of the console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch">best</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420732/bayonetta-3-review-nintendo-switch">games</a>. </p>
<p id="s2lwze">The Switch’s hardware is pulling in the opposite direction of Nintendo’s modern software, which is bigger, better, and more ambitious in scope than ever before. And yet, its strategy of supporting a low-powered device that gets slowly updated is no different for the Switch than it was for Nintendo’s previous consoles. This long-tail strategy has been successful...</p>

  <p id="6AsGzP">Have you ever sat on the toilet, pondering your day, using your phone even though that’s kind of gross to do on the john, avoiding everyone in the house, and thought, “I wish Alexa was in here with me?” That is, what I assume, the designers of the Kohler Numi 2.0 Smart Toilet were thinking when they made this $11,500 toilet that has Alexa inside.</p>

It still has Alexa built-in, and it still has lots of LED lights and speakers, so any guests who come over will know you appreciate the techier things in life. There doesn’t appear to be a warning built into the toilet telling users Alexa is listening to their bowel...</p>

  <p id="4HuaQJ">Nvidia is planning to remove GameStream, a feature for streaming PC games, from its Shield TVs and tablets. GameStream has been a feature of Nvidia Shield devices ever <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review">since they were portable</a>, allowing Shield owners to stream games to their TV from a PC at up to 60fps in 4K resolution.</p>
<p id="bTXmfy">Shield owners will be disappointed to hear that Nvidia isn’t just discontinuing its GameStream feature, but it’s actually going to remove it from devices. An <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5436">update due in mid-February</a> will totally remove the GameStream feature, in a bizarre move after nearly 10 years.</p>
