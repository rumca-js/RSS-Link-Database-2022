Together they break down the ideas of social credit and easy activism, and paint the picture of a world we can strive for, without the demonization and destruction of the one we currently inhabit.\n\nBj\u00f8rn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as \u201cFalse Alarm,\u201d \u201cThe Skeptical Environmentalist,\u201d and \u201cHow to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.\u201d He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.\n \n \n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nShopify: Sign up for a free trial: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee: Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\n\n- Links -\n\n\nFor Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg:\n\nWebsite: https://www.lomborg.com/ \n\n\"What are the smartest solutions for the world?\u201d We did a big book with 50+ teams of economists and several Nobel Laureates, but you can skip to the one-pager here: https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/s...\n\nThinking about climate, read my free, peer-reviewed article https://www.sciencedirect.com/science... , or my new book, False Alarm https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/154....\"\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:30) Intro\n(3:15) Symbolism of the climate cult\n(13:35) Battle for balance\n(19:17) Don\u2019t panic\n(23:20) the Messianic urge\n(30:00) When it\u2019s the end of the world\n(34:00) Hyper simplified moralism\n(40:00) The correct use of science\n(46:00) The better solution, delayed gratification\n(51:33) The problem with \u201cneed\u201d\n(53:45) Wealth for the typical person\n(58:00) Imposing degrowth, inviting totalitarianism\n(1:05:00) Flawed predictions, the real fight\n(1:12:49) The wrong comparison, the right idea\n(1:19:30) Indoor air pollution\n(1:22:00) Education, double for nothing\n(1:30:03) Zone of proximal development\n(1:34:12) Ethical wealth\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkRJb4UbPM", "date_published": "2022-12-19 18:04:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
