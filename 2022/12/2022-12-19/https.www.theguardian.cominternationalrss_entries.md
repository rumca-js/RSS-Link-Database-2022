## Terry Hall was the self-assured eye of the Specials storm

<p>As the pioneering 2 Tone band’s lead singer, Hall’s impassive style made him a star – and helped him weather the vicissitudes of fame, the changing charts and British decline</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/19/terry-hall-lead-singer-of-the-specials-dies-aged-63">Terry Hall: lead singer of the Specials dies aged 63</a><br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2022/dec/20/the-specials-terry-hall-a-life-in-pictures">Terry Hall: a life in a pictures</a></p><p>As the credits roll on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Craze">Dance Craze</a>, the impossibly exciting 1981 concert film shot at the height of the 2 Tone movement, the Specials perform Nite Klub. It’s a noticeably different version of the song to the one that appears on their eponymous 1979 debut album. The intro is long and slow, reflecting songwriter Jerry Dammers’ increasing interest in jazz and easy listening, which would controversially infect the Specials’ second album More Specials. Then the song erupts into frantic ska and the band’s members suddenly spring into life, leaping up and down, rushing backwards and forwards across the stage. Except for Terry Hall, who continues to stand more or less stock still, his face impassive, an occasional nod his solitary concession to what’s happening around him. As the song progresses, audience members start to climb on stage and dance, swamping the band. Dammers gleefully dives into their midst, but Hall has retreated to the rear of the stage, by the drums. He keeps singing about the awfulness of provincial nightlife – “Is this the place to be? What am I doing here?” – while staring balefully at the mayhem before him. The song ends and the screen goes black as Hall emits a mirthless laugh.</p><p>It was a very Terry Hall moment. Everyone remembers the Specials in their prime as a thrilling mass of cartoonish kinetic energy – when the comedy show Not the Nine O’Clock News hamfistedly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnpY2vCwvU0">attempted to parody</a> them, it was with a song called I Like Bouncing – but Hall was invariably the eye of the storm: he might occasionally move in time to the music (and at one point in Dance Craze he climbs down from the stage and sings directly into the rowdy front row) but in comparison with his bandmates, he was a statue, fixing the crowd or the viewer at home with an unblinking, mournful stare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/19/terry-hall-the-self-assured-eye-of-the-specials-storm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>High rents, low pay and spiralling food costs have left younger workers  struggling to make ends meet and worried about the future</p><p>In May 2021, while much of the world was still navigating Covid-19, the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/employment/youth/The-Updated-OECD-Youth-Action-Plan.pdf">OECD warned</a> that young people were being disproportionately hit by the crisis and that there was a risk of “long-term scarring” on their careers and on their economic outcomes. <a href="https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/delivering-for-youth-how-governments-can-put-young-people-at-the-centre-of-the-recovery-92c9d060/">It also found</a> that many young people were suffering from increased instances of depression and anxiety about jobs and personal finances. These worries have not gone away but the inflated cost of living rather than the pandemic, appears now to be acting as the main drag on younger lives. Across the continent, under-30s find their ambitions frustrated by worsening economic conditions. Some of them spoke about the pressures they face in making ends meet, often while juggling work and studies. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/19/my-balance-is-on-zero-young-europeans-on-their-first-experience-of-inflation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The cloaking of Argentina’s hero in a bisht was a public rebuke to critics. But we’ll forget that, and celebrate the amazing World Cup games</p><p>The World Cup has left us with two images of Lionel Messi. One is of him in his Argentinian team shirt, holding up the trophy. The other is of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/qatar-2022-dishes-up-sporting-surprise-and-a-coronation-for-lionel-messi">emir of Qatar</a>, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, putting the traditional Arab men’s cloak, the black <em>bisht</em>, round Messi, just before he receives the trophy. The second image showed the rich state, which had bought the World Cup, rubbing in the world’s noses in it. It should always be an indelible reminder us of what happens when sports organisations give in to the power of money.</p><p>But the other image tells a story we can all associate with. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">a final</a> that ranks as the greatest ever, the greatest player finally wins the one trophy missing from his collection and joins the pantheon of the game’s legends, Pelé and Maradona. The climaxing of the competition reminded us that football can still produce magic, mystery and enthralling drama, and provide the most unexpected twists and turns that uplift us, and, for a few brief hours, make us connect us with strangers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/fifa-qatar-lionel-messi-football-emir-bisht-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The diatribe against Meghan shows how low the rightwing media is willing to go</p><p>What good can possibly come of reacting to Jeremy Clarkson? It is his manifest purpose, his life’s work to rile the right-thinking, so that he can laugh at humourless libtards.

<p>What do you get when you cook with eggs, cream and the occasional shot of booze? That’s right – Christmas on a plate</p><p>Unless you’re American, eggnog is a tough sell. Necking raw egg, albeit sweetened and mixed with cream, is something you can probably only do if you’ve been brought up in a very specific culture (or you happen to be on an absurd protein kick). Things get even less appealing when alcohol is involved, as eggnog often comes spiked with some amount of brown spirit, because then it becomes a hellish hybrid of booze and hangover cure in one. But maybe nog newcomers are going in too hot. After all, what is eggnog if not a weird sort of custard? And what is custard, if not a woefully underused recipe ingredient? That’s right: forget about drinking eggnog. This year I want you to eat it.

## The big idea: Why we need to make the world a darker place

<p>It’s not just bats and other animals that suffer the effects of light pollution – humans need darkness too</p><p>Every year, deep in certain Swedish mines, the bat population is recorded. Each time I take part in the count, I turn out the light for a moment inside the darkness of the mountain to experience the unique sensation of stillness. I’ve started to try to bring that experience with me out of the mine and into my everyday life. Whenever I get the chance, I switch off for a little while and sit in the dark. In an armchair, in the garden, or in the forest. It’s rare that the darkness is as dense and compact as it is in the underworld of the mine passages, but a dark room or an unlit forest path grants the same kind of rest. Darkness is a pause from the constant flood of impressions, it’s a visual silence – and a sort of primitive experience – in the otherwise too well-illuminated modern world.</p><p>For bats, darkness isn’t a form of respite: it’s essential. This animal, which has looked roughly the same for at least 55 million years, has always been nocturnal. None of the 1,400 bat species alive today have acclimatised to the brightest hours of daytime. Darkness is their security, and their senses are formed accordingly. For humans, it’s the opposite: we’re a highly diurnal animal, dependent on sense impressions; light is our safety. Being afraid of the dark is woven deep within our genetic and cultural inheritance and it isn’t strange that today we light up the gardens of our houses, industrial areas and carparks. Humanity has extended the day past dusk and into the night, all the while squeezing out those that seek the darkest corners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/19/the-big-idea-why-we-need-to-make-the-world-a-darker-place">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An epic tale of two Indian revolutionaries told in all its plot-twisting, tiger-fighting, action-packed glory makes for a joyous, often ludicrous movie of air-punching brilliance</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-movies-films-of-2022-in-the-us">50 best movies of 2022 in the US</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture">More on the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>Sometimes, quantity can be quality. This bracing Indian epic is told in such massive strokes, it made every other action movie this year look timid and unambitious. Where else could you find an anticolonialist dance number, a prison breakout involving a man wielding two rifles while being carried on his friend’s shoulders, or a hero ambushing his enemies’ palace by crashing a truck through the gates and leaping out the back, a flaming torch in each hand, alongside a menagerie of tigers, leopards and other wild animals – in slow motion? The movie is jam-packed with surreally bonkers yet brilliantly orchestrated moments like this, and it’s an utter joy.</p><p>Nothing about RRR is small: the size of the crowd scenes, the scale of the battles, the sadistic villainy of the British, the three-hour running time. It was the most expensive Indian movie ever made (an estimated $72m) and it shows. The story is set in the 1920s, during the British Raj, and parallels the journeys of two men who are opposed politically, yet similar in their unbreakable determination and superheroic athleticism. One is Komaram Bheem (NT Rama Rao Jr), who goes to Delhi in search of a girl stolen from his village by the British. The other is Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan), an Indian Imperial Police officer who is determined to rise to the top – by finding Bheem. In their dual quests, both men assume secret identities and – irony of ironies – they become best buddies! But the bromance is destined not to last.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/19/best-movies-of-2022-in-the-us-no-5-rrr">Continue reading...</a>

Despite being teammates, they didn’t speak much during the first six months. “At the beginning, I thought she was arrogant, but as I got to know her, I found myself really drawn into her character,” says Ann-Katrin.</p><p>At the time, Jess was living at home with her family in Barford, Warwickshire, but was keen to spread her wings. “By 2017 I wanted to move out, and found out that Ann was looking for a housemate,” says Jess. “In February, we moved in together in Solihull.” They quickly became great friends, sharing their passion for football and films. “Jess was chilled and there was no drama at all,” says Ann-Katrin. “We like all the same TV shows, so there’s never any fighting over the remote.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/19/how-jess-carter-met-ann-katrin-berger-as-far-as-i-knew-i-thought-i-was-straight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mandy Matney’s Murdaugh Murders and Hedley Thomas’s The Teacher’s Pet have recently seen the subjects of their investigations jailed. But why are podcasts doing the work of police, and can the legal system keep up?</p><p>Mandy Matney is tired. It is late November, and she is busy finishing up the 69th episode of her podcast <a href="https://murdaughmurderspodcast.com/">Murdaugh Murders</a>, a true-crime investigation she began in 2019, and which has now evolved into a complex puzzle of unsolved deaths, insurance fraud, drugs, power and murder. The previous day, a jury in Charleston, South Carolina delivered the first guilty verdict related to the case, and Matney was of course there to cover it. “It was super exciting, and really felt like a huge sigh of relief,” she says. “It’s been a crazy couple of weeks.”</p><p>Hedley Thomas knows this feeling well. Earlier this year, he experienced a similar vindication when his 2018 podcast series <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-teachers-pet/id1385379989">The Teacher’s Pet</a> led to the conviction of former high school PE teacher Chris Dawson for the murder of his wife, Lynette, who disappeared from the couple’s Sydney home 40 years ago. For the past year, Thomas has also been reporting on the murder of another Queensland woman, Shandee Blackburn, and the failings of a DNA laboratory, in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/shandees-story/id1589336606">Shandee’s Story</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/19/true-crime-podcasts-mandy-matney-murdaugh-murders-hedley-thomas-teachers-pet-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Lautaro Martínez had got a fluffy mic from somewhere and was singing into it. Champagne or something fizzy was sprayed around.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what those fucking journalists say,” they sang as they bounded past those journalists and out of there. “Because here is the national team.” Not just any national team: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">the world champions</a>. “I had felt it was going to be,” Messi said. “You have to enjoy it.” Over the last month he has done so, more than ever before, which is part of what had brought them to the final although Messi admitted that they had suffered too. But then as Nico Tagliafico insisted: “If you don’t suffer it doesn’t count.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/19/lionel-scaloni-transformed-argentina-2022-world-cup-winners-qatar">Continue reading...</a>

If you had told me 20 years ago that I would one day stop reading books, I would have said you were crazy.

Cut to 2021, when I realized I had only read five books that year, and the previous year, only eight.</p><p>I didn’t have to wonder why. I already knew it was my phone. We see our phone’s own calculation of how many hours we’ve spent on it each day, and we can’t quite believe it. <em>What?</em> Hours, I realized, that I used to spend reading books. So I made a New Year’s resolution for 2022: more books, less phone. I set a goal for myself of fifty books.

<p>My partner and I needed affordable, secure accommodation at a hard time. Too many are missing out due to shortages and stigma</p><p>After living in a cramped bedroom at my parents’ house during the difficult months of lockdown, my partner and I decided we wanted to get a place of our own in early 2021. But, as is the case for so many other young people, there was no way we’d be able to get a mortgage and buy our own property. Neither of us had savings or great credit scores, and I was constantly in and out of work due to poor mental health. When many banks decided to scrap 5% mortgages owing to economic turmoil, saving up for a deposit became impossible.</p><p>At the time, our only viable option seemed to be privately renting, but finding a place wasn’t easy – properties were snapped up before we could make an offer, and the prices were steep. And as someone with autism and anxiety disorder, the possibility of finding the perfect place and then being asked by the landlord to move out caused my anxiety to spiral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/social-housing-affordable-secure-accommodation-shortages-stigma">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for zabaione

<p>Also known as zabaglione or even sambayon, this boozy, whipped dessert hits the right festive note every time</p><p>What expands but doesn’t fill, and disappears immediately? Zabaione! I have spent far too much time this week thinking about how to riddle what may be my favourite pudding: a boozy, warm, puffed cream. Riddles that turned into terrible jokes after reading Sophia Loren’s wonderful, frisky description of how, in southern Italy, there is a custom of giving newlyweds a good stiff zabaione, “the implication being that the young bride and groom will need all the strength they can get as they put their backs into the first days of wedlock”. </p><p>I made zabaione recently, with a friend who lives in paradise, in a house surrounded by a wild garden, on the edge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maggiore">Lago Maggiore</a>. While it can be made in advance (and kept in the fridge), we agree it is best made and eaten immediately. So, after a meal of gnocchi and vitello tonnato (which I will write about one day), we stood at her stove in our socks, very Sophia Loren, and set up a double boiler and mixed yolk, sugar and fortified wine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/19/rachel-roddy-recipe-zabaione">Continue reading...</a>

That is why we want these strikes averted.</p><p>That is why it is incumbent upon ministers to actually engage now in a meaningful negotiation in order to avoid these strikes.</p><p>If someone has a life and limb emergency, they should call 999. And if it’s not that kind of emergency, they will be told to seek different advice.</p><p>If they think they’ve got the kind of emergency where they would usually call 111, then they should do that, or they should consult a GP or pharmacist. They must use the usual routes available to them and take that advice. There may well be alternative advice available to them that wouldn’t ordinarily be the case.</p><p>This is going to be an incredibly challenging and disrupted week, not only because we have the ambulance service coming out on strike across nearly every region, but also because we’ve got these sequential strikes.</p><p>So we’ve got nurses’ industrial action on Tuesday, and then ambulance services on Wednesday, and I think one will impact the other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/dec/19/union-leaders-dismiss-talks-avert-ambulance-strike-nhs-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From storm-tossed seascapes to skating on the Thames, our cultural critics select wintry wonders for the season’s dark days</p><p><br />Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara play secret lovers in Carol, Todd Haynes’s sumptuous 2015 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s semi-autobiographical novel The Price of Salt. In 1950s Manhattan, Therese (Mara) is an aspiring photographer working in the toy section of a department store for the Christmas season. There, she meets the glamorous Carol (Blanchett), who is buying a doll for her daughter. Their chemistry is instant; an excuse to further meet is proffered when Carol leaves behind a pair of leather gloves. They share furtive, longing glances across the snow, have tête-à-têtes in the booths of cosy diners and reflect on failing relationships with men at holiday parties. The romance is slow burning and exquisite, the city blanketed with snow and lashed with rain, the cold-weather costuming immaculate. <em>Rebecca Liu</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/19/winter-culture-long-dark-carol-cate-blanchett-grouper-orlando">Continue reading...</a>

Given that she’s singing all this over a backing track where jazzy drums and free piano improvisation crash into a reggaeton beat nicked from Daddy Yankee and Wisin’s 2004 hit Saoco, and a synth so filthily distorted it could find a home on a Nine Inch Nails album, it’s a lyric that amounts to stating the obvious, albeit very entertainingly.</p><p>It’s not a collection of sounds that many mainstream pop stars would chose to open the follow-up to their 2m-selling international breakthrough album. But Rosalía’s third album delights in flinging diverse, even contradictory styles together – dembow, hip-hop, dubstep, salsa, industrial, bachata, the experimental electronics of Arca, R&amp;B, flamenco, pure radio-ready pop – and presenting the results to the listener with an insouciant take-it-or-leave-it shrug. It’s the work of an artist who clearly sees her success as a platform that enables you to do what you want rather than an end itself. “Es mala amante la fama y no va a quererme de verdad,” as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd">the Weeknd</a> puts it on their collaboration La Fama: fame’s a lousy lover and won’t ever love you for real.

Her skin has the sheen and glow of someone with a diet rich in omegas and antioxidants, her smile is campaign-ready, her cleavage, cartoonishly framed by a tight, black peekaboo top, is magnificent and cheering on a dull autumn afternoon in my kitchen. I’m pretty confident Claire won’t mind me saying that. Not only is the London-born 30-year-old model in possession of a wicked sense of humour and a contagious cackle, she knows the power clothes have to attract and provoke. “We tell stories when we get dressed in the morning,” she says later. “Whether you like it or not, we’re all telling a story.”</p><p>It is mid-October and Claire is in her apartment in Brooklyn, where she lives when she’s not in London. She’s been in town for a week, the longest she’s been in one spot since the summer. Fashion month happened in September; Claire walked in 14 shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris. “I feel like I’ve been on tour,” she says, “but without the lovely singing voice.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/19/alva-claire-i-dont-do-things-by-halves-the-rise-of-one-of-fashions-top-models">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Freed from the shadow of 9/11, the country’s artists are building on a rich heritage – to international acclaim</p><p>In August, Pakistan’s three censor boards cleared Saim Sadiq’s award-winning film Joyland for release. Shot in Lahore, the film is about a young married man from a conservative family who finds work at a dance theatre and falls in love with a trans woman struggling to land her moment on stage. It was the first Pakistani film to screen at Cannes and it won the Un Certain Regard prize, receiving a standing ovation nearly10 minutes long. </p><p>Even though the film was then subject to various <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/14/joyland-pakistan-bans-oscar-contender-film-about-trans-love-affair">bans in Pakistan</a>, after being accused of pushing an LGTBQ+ agenda and misrepresenting Pakistani culture, it finally appeared in Pakistani cinemas in November, with Malala Yousafzai signing on as executive producer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/19/pakistan-art-pop-culture-joyland-ms-marvel">Continue reading...</a>

We were exhausted and overwhelmed. By mid-March, the city of Kharkiv, situated 25 miles from the Russian border, looked unreachable from Kyiv, where I live. Ukrainians were adjusting to this new life. Under the constant shelling, hotels and shops were not able to offer any kind of normal service. We were not sure whether petrol stations were open. Yet the second-biggest city in Ukraine, where around 2 million people were living, was too important to stay away from. I had close friends who could host me. So I went.</p><p>It was my friends who had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/kyiv-putin-bombs-invasion-airstrikes-ukraine-russia">said</a>, in the early hours of the morning of 24 February, that “Kharkiv is being bombed”, confirming our worst fears. I had visited them in January, before the war, reporting on the mood in the city, and visited their newly bought apartment on the top floor of an old house in the centre. Kharkiv was the first place in Ukraine to have its city centre shelled.

<p>If there were ever a moment that made it undeniably clear the Patriots Dynasty was ancient history, New England’s jaw-dropping loss to the Raiders on Sunday may have been it</p><p>Sometimes when watching sports, one witnesses a play so ridiculous and inexplicable that one’s brain cannot even properly process what exactly has just happened. Case in point: the bizarre final sequence of the New England Patriots’ backbreaking 30-24 road loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. If there ever were a moment that laid bare how the Patriots Dynasty was officially in the rear-view mirror, we may have just witnessed it.</p><p>Officially, the game ended with Raiders defensive end Chandler Jones picking off a lateral thrown by Patriots receiver Jakobi Meyers and rumbling into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. In the official game stats, it went down as a fumble recovery.

<p>Tiger is a protective father but the decision to catapult his son into public view at the PNC Championship is an interesting one</p><p>Nobody who owns a yacht named Privacy is likely to pursue publicity. Tiger Woods has made the keeping of secrets an art form despite spending the majority of his life as one of the most recognisable people on earth. Hank Haney, the golf coach, once told the story of being chastised by his star client for giving a television executive a nod towards Woods’s likely schedule. Any member of the media who claims they properly <em>know </em>Woods is spoofing; there is deliberate, visible distance kept between the 15-times major winner and all but those within his inner sanctum. So many questions, so few answers.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the profile given to 13-year-old Charlie Woods – and at his father’s own volition – is intriguing. The PNC Championship in Orlando ordinarily provides a bit of hit-and-giggle for high-profile golfing families but the now routine involvement of Team Woods raises interest levels significantly. Including to the point where it can make for uncomfortable reading or listening. This weekend, we have seen Charlie’s divot pattern assessed. Every pose and swing is likened to his iconic father. This is a child, subject to the kind of scrutiny that would be deemed unhealthy by plenty of onlookers. How does Charlie seamlessly return to the classroom having been plastered all over the Golf Channel for 72 hours?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/19/tiger-woods-charlie-woods-golf-comment">Continue reading...</a>

## Say She She: Prism review – boundary-busting discodelic soul

<p><strong>(Karma Chief)<br /></strong>The Brooklyn trio conspire to produce an idiosyncratic album that ranges from drum- machine funk to small-hours sublimity</p><p>You can imagine Brooklyn-based trio Say She She’s “discodelic soul” fitting neatly into New York’s early-80s post-punk, post-disco world. That’s not to say that their sound is self-consciously retro – in fact, there’s something very 2022 about its warm, lo-fi, bedroom pop-adjacent production – more to suggest that, as with a lot of artists of the early 80s scene, there’s something appealingly idiosyncratic and boundary-busting about their sound. It stirs together everything from budget electronics to soft Philly soul and the echoing space of dub and tops it off with beautiful vocal harmonies: all three members – London-born Piya Malik and Americans Nya Parker Gazelle and Sabrina Cunningham – started out as classical singers.</p><p>A little less spiky than their singles Forget Me Not and Norma, which were inspired by feminist activists the Guerrilla Girls and the overturning of Roe v Wade, respectively, Prism offers an embarrassment of fabulous songs. Pink Roses deals with grief via spindly bargain-basement disco. The title track throws up off-centre, drum-machine-driven funk – if you want a recherché comparison, its rhythm vaguely recalls Voggue’s post-disco hit Dancin’ the Night Away – while the beatless, weightless closer, Better Man, is an exercise in small-hours sublimity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/19/say-she-she-prism-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bereavement policies in the US are dismal, leaving workers without time or pay to grieve</p><p>I distinctly remember reading the bereavement leave policy in the employee handbook when I started my new job as a 22-year-old recent graduate. Three days seemed short to me, but if paired with a couple of sick days it would probably be enough to take a week off to support my family, help with arrangements and travel to a memorial service if an older extended family member passed away.</p><p>“I can make that work,” I thought to myself, hopeful that it wouldn’t be necessary. Less than two years later, when I was 24, my spouse Eli died suddenly and unexpectedly in an accident. I don’t remember much from that night, except that I ran to the bathroom after his death was confirmed; nausea was the first symptom of shock. I was shaking so harshly that all I could hear were my teeth chattering as they knocked together uncontrollably.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/19/us-poor-bereavement-policies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Swinging paintcans, electrified sinks, a drop from a zipwire … in The Unofficial Science of Home Alone, the comics undergo the Christmas classic’s booby traps – to see what would <em>really</em> happen</p><p>In a grey corner of Borehamwood in deepest Hertfordshire, a film set is coming alive with one of Christmas’s most magical traditions: cartoonish ultraviolence. Bags of unopened marbles lie ready to shatter someone’s vertebrae. A blowtorch is rigged to incinerate the first person to step through a doorway. Piles of dented paint tins are freshly bent out of shape from being swung into torsos. And everywhere there is tinsel, fake snow and twinkling fairy lights. ‘Tis the season to be jolly, all right – jolly badly hurt.</p><p>This is the set of a new show celebrating one of the all-time classic Christmas movies. The Unofficial Science of Home Alone is a look at what would happen if you actually subjected someone to the film’s booby traps. To do so, they’ve created an exact recreation of the set and the pranks – with a couple of exceptions. First (presumably for legal reasons) the staircase is lined with photos of a family that looks like (but is not) the McCallisters, including a fake Macaulay Culkin whose blazer and dodgy bow-tie make him a closer match to a young Niles Crane.

Over the course of the weekend, an Arctic airmass that was sitting over northern Canada, characterised by extremely low temperatures and strong high pressure, slid to the south across Alberta and Saskatchewan into eastern states of the Pacific north-west. Temperatures across these regions averaged about -23C at around midday on Sunday.</p><p>Through the week, this airmass will slowly spread southward across central states, with temperatures ranging from 10-30 degrees below average. Later in the week, the airmass will extend to the south, reaching Texas and even Florida, with some areas possibly reaching up to 45 degrees below normal. This cold airmass is likely going to interact with an area of low pressure across the eastern half of the country towards the end of the week, threatening significant snowfall to states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/19/weather-tracker-temperatures-set-to-plunge-across-us-states">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ambitious documentary pieces together snatches of public and private history since the uprising against Assad</p><p>Diana El Jeiroudi’s film is a complex and sprawling curation of images, sequences and ideas orbiting the central subject of Syria and its anti-Assad uprising: this ambitious work is something between a conventional contemporary documentary (and by that token without a voiceover that would introduce or explain things), a video diary, an installation piece where clips filmed years apart are presented randomly or free-associatively. It perhaps has the procedural aesthetic of YouTube (where many people under siege in Homs uploaded their own searing footage of lives under attack), with videos queued up to be played by the user.</p><p>One of the many questions the viewer might have is about the meaning of the title: is the Syrian republic silent in that its tyrannical government shuts down dissenting voices? Or is it that the silence is elsewhere in the rest of the world, which is unsure how or if to respond? The film is sited partly in Syria itself, where the film-maker’s friend, geneticist Rami Abou Jamra, is carrying out medical research about inherited learning difficulty; there are dramatic scenes of demonstrations, attacks and some brutal images of torture scars and bullet wounds. It also shows the director’s home life in Berlin, where she lives in exile with fellow film-maker and partner Orwa Nyrabia who, like El Jeiroudi, is a director of the Dox Box documentary film festival back in Syria (where he briefly went missing) and also the director of the Amsterdam documentary film festival.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/19/republic-of-silence-review-syria-assad-documentary-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Minorities need better policing and healthcare. What they get is a discussion about the hurt feelings of the rich and famous</p><p>You probably won’t remember this, considering everything that followed, but when Harry and Meghan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-windsor-gospel-power-pageantry">got married</a>, there was a popular view in the media that their union was a watershed moment for British race relations. The wedding, we were told, cast a spell on black, white and mixed-race people alike, enchanted by the nods to Meghan’s Afro-American cultural heritage during the ceremony. “A new era dawns,” a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/world/europe/meghan-markle-prince-harry-wedding.html">New York Times</a> headline read. “Modern” was a word often used to describe the pair. A modern wedding, for a modern couple, in a modern Britain.<br /><br />This new era did not dawn. But the prophecies of it are useful to revisit, because they should remind us that it didn’t matter then, and it doesn’t matter now. Because the country that Harry and Meghan married in was one that, just a few months before their wedding, declared Paulette Wilson, who had lived in Britain for 50 years, “removable to Jamaica” and detained her in Yarl’s Wood. The Windrush scandal was also “modern” Britain.</p><p>The diversity and inclusion struggles of rich, famous people say little about the country as a whole outside the lives of those rich, famous people. But even though they are tiny in number, they are gigantic in influence. Their ability to amplify their grievances means that we plot the racial history of this country via the journeys of its least relevant protagonists, such as princes and Hollywood actors. <strong> </strong>These figures inhabit such a different universe that not even their publicists are grounded enough to tell them that complaining in a Netflix documentary that the ceilings of their temporary palace cottage were too low is not something they should be attempting to solicit sympathy for.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/harry-and-meghan-racism-britain-netflix-documentary">Continue reading...</a>
