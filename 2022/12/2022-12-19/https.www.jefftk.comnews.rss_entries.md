In 2011 effective altruists in Oxford had two main organizations: </span>

<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a> and 

<a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>.  They wanted to
incorporate, and created the 

<a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for
Effective Altruism</a> as an umbrella organization to host them: [1]

</p>

<p>

Over time they started running other projects: <a href="https://www.eaglobal.org/">conferences</a>, supporting local
groups, the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">EA
forum</a>, <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-health">community
health</a>, etc.  There was effectively a "CEA" community-focused
organization within the "CEA" umbrella organization:

</p>

<p>

This was pretty confusing: when someone said "CEA" did they mean the
organization focused on the EA community ("CEA runs EA Global") or the
umbrella organization ("80k is part of CEA")?  This got even more
confusing as there started to be more organizations and projects:

</p>

<p>

In September 2022 the umbrella organization renamed itself to
<a href="https://ev.org/">Effective Ventures</a>:

Unfortunately the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9gHTYC5qbSH9E37vx/cea-ops-is-now-ev-ops">announcement</a>
wasn't very clear about what specifically was changing, and a lot of
people are <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=F9SNzY8T6oTwhXZdq#F9SNzY8T6oTwhXZdq">still</a> <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xBfp3HGapGycuSa6H/i-m-less-approving-of-the-ea-community-now-than-before-the?commentId=hfibmmctEsuwBKqp3#hfibmmctEsuwBKqp3">confused</a> about when to say "CEA" and when to say
"EV".  Hopefully this history and the diagrams clear things up a bit!

[EDIT: changed 'EVF' to 'EV'; <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xaMLvzbaBMFjX88Z2/cea-disambiguation?commentId=sbxFkjEKBTFT5mbgh">Shakeel
says</a> they prefer the latter.]
