Pine Tar Poker is a yahtzee-inspired poker game with just a touch of cosmic horror for iOS and Android.<p>I started working on this idea last January by making a paper prototype: a simple printed score sheet I could use with a real deck of cards. I had some fun with that, so I brought it into Unity and kept expanding on it over the last 11 months during nights and weekends. It's tough for me to stay motivated on side projects and see them through to release, but the act of shipping something is so fulfilling that it's usually worth the pain. For Pine Tar, I stretched myself in the narrative department by adding a bit of a Lovecraftian tone to what would otherwise be a Western saloon setting.<p>One thing that kept me motivated during development was seeing my dad get hooked on the card game. He'd text me when he got his first royal flush and when he prestiged the score sheet -- he got every hand type in one game! He has amassed so much in-game cash, I think I need to expand the number of digits I show there!<p>If you get a chance to try it, let me know what you think! If you can't afford it and want to try it, I have a few codes for both platforms, my email is in my profile.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34058358\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34058358</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://www.pinetarpoker.com", "date_published": "2022-12-19 22:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Sydney CBD is bringing back pedestrian \u201cbeg buttons\u201d", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/sydney-cbd-is-bringing-back-pedestrian-beg-buttons/\">https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/sydney-cbd-is-bringing-back-pedestrian-beg-buttons/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34058004\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34058004</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 28</p>", "link": "https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/sydney-cbd-is-bringing-back-pedestrian-beg-buttons/", "date_published": "2022-12-19 21:29:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "American EVs reduced gasoline consumption by just 0.54% in 2021", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/american-evs-reduced-gasoline-consumption-by-just-0-54-in-2021/\">https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/american-evs-reduced-gasoline-consumption-by-just-0-54-in-2021/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057981\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057981</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/american-evs-reduced-gasoline-consumption-by-just-0-54-in-2021/", "date_published": "2022-12-19 21:28:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "How did Roomba-recorded photos end up on Facebook?", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/\">https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057699\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057699</a></p>\n<p>Points: 31</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/", "date_published": "2022-12-19 21:04:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "What happened to the first cryogenically frozen humans?", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/the-future/cryonics-horror-stories/\">https://bigthink.com/the-future/cryonics-horror-stories/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057671\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34057671</a></p>\n<p>Points: 29</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://bigthink.com/the-future/cryonics-horror-stories/", "date_published": "2022-12-19 21:02:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: What is the cheapest, easiest way to host a cronjob in 2022?", "description": "<p>I thought this could start a good debate on the subject.

You can use it to store environment variables and inject them into your applications locally or into CI/CD and production infrastructure. It can be used with any language/framework and is platform independent with a super easy setup.<p>We know secret managers exist but, in our experience, they\u2019re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three \u2014 other nicer ones are closed-source and don\u2019t have self-hosted options available. That\u2019s why we\u2019re on a mission to make secret management more accessible to every developer \u2014 not just security teams.<p>We\u2019ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations.

"https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Tell HN: Google Maps location data is used for GeoIP updates", "description": "<p>Hi,<p>I've been meaning to write this for a few years now.\nI saw https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032484 and lots of great replies there - but I happen to have an insight which I kept track of for years now.<p>Some background first. Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).\nMy \"workaround\" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786", "date_published": "2022-12-19 14:57:24+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "google"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "A few new things in Emacs 29", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://mbork.pl/2022-12-19_A_few_new_things_in_Emacs_29\">https://mbork.pl/2022-12-19_A_few_new_things_in_Emacs_29</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052468\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052468</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "link": "https://mbork.pl/2022-12-19_A_few_new_things_in_Emacs_29", "date_published": "2022-12-19 14:34:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Code Design Decision \u2013 Always throw custom exceptions", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/getparthenon/parthenon/wiki/Design-Decision:-Throw-Custom-Exceptions\">https://github.com/getparthenon/parthenon/wiki/Design-Decision:-Throw-Custom-Exceptions</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052363\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052363</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://github.com/getparthenon/parthenon/wiki/Design-Decision:-Throw-Custom-Exceptions", "date_published": "2022-12-19 14:25:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Structuring Clojure Applications", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://yogthos.net/posts/2022-12-18-StructuringClojureApplications.html\">https://yogthos.net/posts/2022-12-18-StructuringClojureApplications.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052268\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052268</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://yogthos.net/posts/2022-12-18-StructuringClojureApplications.html", "date_published": "2022-12-19 14:16:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Pixel Accurate Atkinson Dithering for Images in HTML", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html\">https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052253\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052253</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html", "date_published": "2022-12-19 14:15:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: Has anyone here turned around their life in their 40s?", "description": "<p>I know the best of my life is behind me, but I need help salvaging what's left of it. I've been meaning to ask for help for a couple of years now, but only now got around to it after being scared by my first real suicidal ideation a few nights ago. HN is probably not a suitable platform for this, but /r/advice seems to be not very active and I can't post on /adv/ due to some IP range ban. There are no mental health facilities in the small town where I live. I let my professional network decay and die, and there is literally nowhere else I can get any kind of useful, actionable advice.<p>I'm a 43-years-old single guy, NEET for the past decade. I got my Master's in the US in the late 2000s and was gainfully employed there for a few years (NOT in my field of education; long story) until I had to return to my home country to take care of my ailing father. He passed on within a year of my return, leaving my family with a financial mess, and his death took a lot out of me. I still obviously miss him, but in wallowing in depression and self-pity, I let the prime of my life pass me by.<p>As I stand, I have no current skills related to either my education (MEng) or my previous work experience (BI Reporting/Analytics). I don't have ideas/skills/network for entrepreneurship.<p>I had all the desires of a regular guy: a wife, kids, a house, meaningful work, etc. I mean I still do, but I guess I'm too late for the first few. Every night I promise myself to do/be better tomorrow and somehow get myself to sleep. I was once looked up to, now I'm a pity case and an example case of how not to throw one's life away.<p>With every passing day, I am becoming more bitter, angry and disillusioned. I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't know how to even _start_ thinking of ways to get myself out of this hole.<p>Ideally, I would prefer to go back to the US; not only for the dollars (they're nice), but also because I actually was happy there. I'd do all the things that I didn't do enough of because I was focused on saving money and because I thought that there would always be time for them when I was more stable/settled.<p>The good: No diseases AFAIK, no vices at all other than severe procrastination and a masterful ability to lie to myself. I have ~US$25k-equivalent in salary savings from a decade ago.<p>Sorry if the above text is rambling and not very cohesive. I've probably also skipped over some useful information I should have provided. Please do ask. I'll take some time reflecting on your replies and then respond.

I haven't been to the eye doctor since, but at that point my vision was around 20/20 or slightly impaired. I did get glasses, which I rarely wear, but I have been wearing them more recently because I feel that my eyesight may be becoming more of an issue. For example, after long periods of coding or looking at my phone screen, I see floaters. Sometimes I wake up seeing them and have a low-productivity day or take a nap and some Advil in the hope that it is related to a migraine.<p>I am mainly interested in what tools, settings, and themes people with astigmatism use, and if you have any preference for light or dark themes. Personally, I cannot stand light, whether it is physical light or light on screens. When my 5-year-old turns on the overhead light in my bedroom, I pull the blanket over my head or shout to turn it off. I feel like Gizmo from Gremlins.<p>I am a developer, and my main tools are Terminator + Tmux, Chrome, DBeaver, and Visual Studio Code. The font I am using is Jetbrains SemiBold. I just tried the Solarized Dark theme and I am kind of liking it, but I feel like I might be able to find something slightly better. Before that, I have used Night Owl, GitHub Dark, Material, and a few others.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
