injection-site reactions (sore arm for example)

generalised symptoms such as ‘flu-like’ illness

headache, chills, fatigue (tiredness), nausea (feeling sick), fever, dizziness, weakness, aching muscles, rapid heartbeat

they may be reported more frequently in younger adults

Overall, our advice remains that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks in the majority of people. 

The benefits of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and serious complications associated with COVID-19 far outweigh any currently known side effects in the majority of patients.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax. 

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. 

Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.

Few days, primarily occurred within 14 days,

more often after the second dose,

more often in younger males

risk profile appears to be similar for the second and the third dose

Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 

Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis,

such as (acute or persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations following vaccination.

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

Who can get a COVID-19 vaccine
