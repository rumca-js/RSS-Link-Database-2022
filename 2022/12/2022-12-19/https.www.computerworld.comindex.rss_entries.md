First, it’s a patch that either installs with no problems or leads to a blue screen of death (BSOD). It can also be an indicator we have a problem getting updated drivers on our systems.

It ensures only trusted software can be loaded and executed on during the boot process by using cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of the process and the software being loaded.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3683213/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-microsoft-s-kb5012170-patch.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
