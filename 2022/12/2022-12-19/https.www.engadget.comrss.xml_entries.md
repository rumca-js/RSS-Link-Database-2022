<p>Earlier this year, Porsche <a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycans-will-charge-faster-and-go-farther-with-latest-ota-updates-082654912.html">released a substantial software update</a> for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">sporty Taycan EV</a> that delivered range and charging speed improvements. If you feel those enhancements weren't enough, the automaker is <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2022/products/porsche-taycan-on-board-charger-reduces-charging-times-30721.html">releasing a hardware upgrade</a> for existing Taycan models that halves charging times. On Performance Battery-equipped Taycans, Porsche says its new 19.2 kW onboard charging module cuts Level 2 charging times from nine-and-a-half hours to just under five hours. Meanwhile, those with Performance Battery Plus models can look forward to refilling their car's battery from zero to full in a little over five hours, down from ten-and-a-half hours previously. The module also adds Plug and Charge capabilities to 2020 Taycans, a feature that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-2021-030224656.html">first arrived on 2021 models</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Porsche Taycan charging module" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/16a03f40-7ff1-11ed-bbf6-9720185310c9" style="height: 1200; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Porsche</div></figure><p>Dramatically improving your Taycan's charging times will cost you $1,850.15. It will also take your local Porsche dealership about 12 hours to install the module, so if you're thinking about purchasing the upgrade for your EV, expect to be without your car for at least a day. The module is also available as an upgrade for new Taycans. You can add it to your order by selecting the KB4 option from the online configurator. If you want to take advantage of 19.2 kW charging speeds at home you can also purchase Porsche's new wall charging unit. It retails for $1,586 (not including installation fees) and requires a 100-amp circuit for the best possible performance, though Porsche says it can also work with lower-capacity circuits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## Twitter 'Affiliate' badges arrive to combat brand impersonation

<p>In mid-November, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-organization-related-accounts-verification-194525167.html">said</a> Twitter was working on a feature that would allow brands and organizations to identify accounts associated with them. A month later, the company has begun rolling that feature out. As first spotted by social media consultant (and former<em> Next Web </em>journalist<em>) </em><a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1604931247620456450?s=20&amp;t=n8qcTKUufR0FQnPuBNgKgw">Matt Navarra</a>, Twitter has added a new &quot;Affiliate&quot; badge that can appear alongside an account's verified checkmark. The purpose of the icon is to point you to the account's parent account if it's not the primary account of a brand or organization. For instance, if you visit the <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport">Twitter Support account</a>, you can click on the badge to go straight to the main Twitter account. Brands now also have square profile pictures to further differentiate their presence on the platform.</p><p>Musk first announced the feature in the same week that Twitter made its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">first failed attempt</a> at rolling out paid account verification. After the company began enrolling users into its revamped Twitter Blue subscription, verified trolls used the service to impersonate brands and celebrities. The situation was a nightmare for businesses like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-insulin-not-free-eli-221824378.html">Eli Lilly</a>. The pharmaceutical firm saw billions of dollars erased from its market cap after a fake &quot;verified&quot; account misled people into believing the company was making insulin free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="abd8171bbd8f45399157b76005c99b79"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW!

## A fan reverse-engineered 1995's 'Star Wars: Dark Forces' to make it easier to play on modern systems

<p>By modern standards, 1995's <em>Dark Forces </em>doesn't look like much, but it's rightfully considered one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-star-wars-games-on-pc/">more important Star Wars games</a> ever released. Not only did it introduce important technical innovations to the first-person shooter genre, but it also went on to have an outsized effect on later <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PVNzcFdObWdhNnVRJmFiX2NoYW5uZWw9RWNrc0NsaXBzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0N2I5OWQ4NS0yNTY1LTQ4NzAtOGQxOS1iZDdhYzIzY2YzMjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATs8GWYKs72r1ywJ6Grg2pX_iVECdIUjvT7DY_3tRtP4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSspWNmga6uQ%26ab_channel%3DEcksClips">Star Wars canon</a> and spawned the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-star-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy-ps4-switch.html">Jedi Knight series</a>. However, like a lot of games from the mid-'90s, revisiting <em>Dark Forces </em>can be challenging. Before today, your best bet was to buy a digital copy of the game<em>&nbsp;</em>from either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32400/STAR_WARS__Dark_Forces/">Steam</a> or <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3N0YXJfd2Fyc19kYXJrX2ZvcmNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDdiOTlkODUtMjU2NS00ODcwLThkMTktYmQ3YWMyM2NmMzIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAddJiL6TLp4k-ikM36P9HMLWE21jWS7Imuvt1qOam6jM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_wars_dark_forces">GOG </a>and use <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a> to emulate it on a modern computer. <em>Dark Forces</em> is <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/GAMES:Star_Wars:_Dark_Forces">one of the easier games</a> to get running on DOSBox, but the software can be intimidating if you've never used it before.</p><div id="840ec8a8f4de48bd8a4106f8439d3edc"></div><p>Enter The Force Engine. The <a href="https://theforceengine.github.io/">project</a> is primarily the work of <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine">LuciusDXL</a>, who spent three years reverse engineering LucasArts' proprietary Jedi Engine to make the two games that were built with it ‚Äî <em>Dark Forces </em>and 1997's <em>Outlaws </em>‚Äî easier to run on modern systems. With version 1.0, TFE is compatible with both the GOG and Steam versions of <em>Dark Forces</em>. Once you've installed the software, it will automatically detect the game's executable, and you can start playing without needing to do things like adjusting cycles in DOSBox.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What's more, it adds a handful of features to make it easier to appreciate <em>Dark Forces</em> in 2022. One big addition is support for modern widescreen resolutions, so you don't have to play the game at its original 320 by 200 resolution. Other optional quality-of-life improvements include full mouselook support and a new save system that allows you to make quicksaves. If you're a fan of <em>Outlaws</em>, LuciusDXL says they're working on adding support for the cult classic shooter as part of TFE's version 2.0 release. While there's no release date for that yet, LuciusDXL <a href="https://theforceengine.github.io/Roadmap.html">estimates</a> it won't take them nearly as long now that they've gone through the process of reverse-engineering <em>Dark Forces</em>.</p>

## The best Nintendo Switch games for 2023

<p>Just five years ago, Nintendo was at a crossroads. The Wii U was languishing well in third place in the console wars and, after considerable pressure, the company was making its first tentative steps into mobile gaming with <em>Miitomo</em> and <em>Super Mario Run</em>. Fast-forward to today: The Switch is likely on the way to becoming the company‚Äôs best-selling ‚Äúhome console‚Äù ever, and seven Switch <em>games</em> have outsold the Wii U console. Everything‚Äôs coming up Nintendo, then, thanks to the Switch‚Äôs unique hybrid format and an ever-growing game library with uncharacteristically strong third-party support.</p><p>However, the Switch's online store isn't the easiest to navigate, so this guide aims to help the uninitiated start their journey on the right foot. These are the games you should own ‚Äî for now. We regularly revise and add to the list as appropriate. Oh, and if you've got a Switch Lite, don't worry: Every game on the list is fully supported by the portable-only console.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdTUjFCUk41P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARSMfKdTVgEk3ja-Ql5O3gEHCgEiR_uH8TLM4tsVHerU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07SR1BRN5"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> is the best game in the series yet. It streamlines many of the clunky aspects from earlier games and gives players plenty of motivation to keep shaping their island community. As you'd expect, it also looks better than any previous entry, giving you even more motivation to fill up your virtual home and closet. The sound design reaches ASMR levels of brain-tingling comfort. And yes, it certainly helps that <em>New Horizons</em> is an incredibly soothing escape from reality when we're all stuck at home in the midst of a global pandemic.</p><h2>Bayonetta 3</h2><p></p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em> is a delicious amplification of the series‚Äô most ridiculous themes. It indulges in absurdity without disrupting the rapid-fire combat or Bayonetta‚Äôs unrivaled sense of fashion and wit. <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is joyful, mechanically rich and full of action, plus it allows players to transform into a literal hell train in order to take down massive beasts bent on destroying the multiverse. Bayonetta elegantly dances her way through battles, dropping one-liners and shooting enemies with her gun shoes in one moment, and turning into a giant spider creature the next.</p><p>The Bayonetta series just keeps getting weirder, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs losing its sense of satisfying gameplay along the way. In the franchise‚Äôs third installment, Bayonetta is powerful, confident and funny; she‚Äôs a drag queen in a universe loosely held together by witchcraft, and the chaos of this combination is truly magical.</p><h2>Astral Chain</h2><p></p><p>I was on the fence about <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bc3RyYWwtQ2hhaW4tTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwN05RRjc0TTM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR3jcHvEHVPju10gNjSLwIo_zbdlzxjIKKSe76NJpQvv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAstral-Chain-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07NQF74M3"><em>Astral Chain</em></a> from the day the first trailer came out until a good few hours into my playthrough. It all felt a little too generic, almost a paint-by-numbers rendition of an action game. I needn't have been so worried, as it's one of the more original titles to come from PlatinumGames, the developer behind the Bayonetta series, in recent years.</p><p>In a future where the world is under constant attack from creatures that exist on another plane of existence, you play as an officer in a special force that deals with this threat. The game's gimmick is that you can tame these creatures to become Legions that you use in combat. Encounters play out with you controlling both your character and the Legion simultaneously to deal with waves of mobs and larger, more challenging enemies. As well as for combat, you'll use your Legion(s) to solve crimes and traverse environments.</p><p><em>Astral Chain</em> sticks closely to a loop of detective work, platforming puzzles and combat ‚Äî a little too closely, if I'm being critical ‚Äî with the game split into cases that serve as chapters. The story starts off well enough but quickly devolves into a mashup of various anime tropes, including twists and arcs ripped straight from some very famous shows and films. However, the minute-to-minute gameplay is enough to keep you engaged through the 20-hour or so main campaign and into the fairly significant end-game content.</p><p>Does <em>Astral Chain</em> reach the heights of <em>Nier: Automata</em>? No, not at all, but its combat and environments can often surpass that game, which all-told is probably my favorite of this generation.

It's a great platformer, but it's also a puzzle game. It's extremely punishing, but it's also very accessible. It puts gameplay above everything, but it has a great story. It's a beautiful, moving and memorable contradiction of a game, created by MattMakesGames, the indie studio behind the excellent <em>Towerfall</em>. So, <em>Celeste</em> is worth picking up no matter what platform you own, but its room-based levels and clear 2D artwork make it a fantastic game to play on the Switch when on the go.</p><h2>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EcmFnb24tUXVlc3QtWEktRWx1c2l2ZS1EZWZpbml0aXZlLU5pbnRlbmRvL2RwL0IwN05RR0RYUlk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATtEkVVMJKVpot09mb9yKTD4LQufirePuQJHccNZsP8L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDragon-Quest-XI-Elusive-Definitive-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB07NQGDXRY"><em>Dragon Quest XI</em></a> is an unashamedly traditional Japanese role-playing game. Most of the characters are established RPG tropes: mute protagonist-who‚Äôs-actually-a-legendary-hero, sister mages, mysterious rogue and the rest. Then there‚Äôs the battle system, which has rarely changed in the decades of the series. (There‚Äôs a reason that this special edition features a 16-bit styled version of the game: The mechanics and story work just as well in more... graphically constrained surroundings.) While the story hits a lot of familiar RPG beats, everything takes an interesting turn later on. And through it, the game demands completion. RPGs require compelling stories, and this has one. It just doesn‚Äôt quite kick in until later.</p><p>This eleventh iteration of the series also serves as a celebration of all things Dragon Quest. Without getting too deep into the story, the game heavily references the first game, taking place in the same narrative universe, just hundreds of years later.</p><p>The Switch edition doesn‚Äôt offer the most polished take on the game ‚Äî it‚Äôs available on rival consoles ‚Äî but the characters, designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame, move around fluidly, in plenty of detail despite the limits of the hybrid console. And while it‚Äôs hard to explain, There‚Äôs also something just plain <em>right</em> about playing a traditional JRPG on a Nintendo console.</p><h2>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXJlLUVtYmxlbS1Ib3VzZXMtTmludGVuZG8tRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDdETTdLRDRXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcEmBmuXrAF337sijYudHXk7PJvCm_WJALON4PEQBCKN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFire-Emblem-Houses-Nintendo-Digital%2Fdp%2FB07DM7KD4W"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a> is one hell of a game.

It's an action-RPG developed by the team behind <em>Bastion</em>, <em>Transistor </em>and <em>Pyre</em>. You play Zagreus, son of Hades, who's having a little spat with his dad, and wants to escape from the underworld. To do so, Zagreus has to fight his way through the various levels of the underworld and up to the surface. Along the way, you‚Äôll pick up ‚Äúboons‚Äù from a wide range of ancient deities like Zeus, Ares and Aphrodite, which stack additional effects on your various attacks. Each level is divided into rooms full of demons, items and the occasional miniboss.</p><p>As <em>Hades</em> is a ‚Äúroguelike‚Äù game, you start at the same place every time, with the levels rearranged. With that said, the items you collect can be used to access and upgrade new weapons and abilities that stick between sessions. <em>Hades</em> initially caught our attention just for its gameplay: You can jump in for 30 minutes and have a blast, or find yourself playing for hours. As the game neared its final release, the storytelling, world-building and its general character really started to take shape ‚Äî there‚Äôs so much to do, so many people to meet and even some romance stuffed in there. You could play for hundreds of hours and still have fun.</p><h2>Hollow Knight</h2><p></p><p>This was a real sleeper hit, and one of very few Kickstarter games to not only live up to but exceed expectations. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Ib2xsb3ctS25pZ2h0LU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDdRSFhNM0pZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASK479VKqSlkjjATizIaol_0AHoFXK1ZFdFESa_HNadL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHollow-Knight-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07QHXM3JY"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a 2D action-adventure game in the Metroidvania style, but it's also just a <em>mood</em>. Set in a vast, decrepit land, which you'll explore gradually as you unlock new movement and attack skills for your character, a Burtonesque bug-like creature. Short on both dialogue and narrative, the developers instead convey a story through environment and atmosphere, and it absolutely nails it.</p><p>You'll start out feeling fairly powerless, but <em>Hollow Knight</em> has a perfect difficulty curve, always allowing you to progress but never making it easy. For example, it borrows the Dark Souls mechanic where you'll need to travel back to your corpse upon death to retrieve your "Geo" (the game's stand-in for Souls), which is always a tense time. Throughout it all, though, the enemies and NPCs will never fail to delight. For a moody game, it has a nice sense of humor and levity imbued mostly through the beautifully animated and voiced folks you meet. Given its low cost and extremely high quality, there's really no reason not to get this game. Trust us, it'll win you over.</p><h2>Into The Breach</h2><p></p><p>When is a turn-based strategy game not a turn-based strategy game? <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnRvLUJyZWFjaC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDdIMlJDTEpYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ6A7FscFue0kj6YIjiivOsIamIRL74fBR7IQQLGJ5pb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInto-Breach-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB07H2RCLJX"><em>Into the Breach</em></a>, an indie roguelike game where you control mechs to stem an alien attack, defies conventions, and is all the better for it. While its core mechanics are very much in the XCOM (or Fire Emblem, for that matter) mold, it's what it does with those mechanics that's so interesting. A traditional turn-based strategy game plays out like a game of chess ‚Äî you plan a move, while predicting what your opponent will do in return, and thinking ahead to what you'll do next, and so on, with the eventual goal of forcing them into a corner and winning. At the start of every <em>Into the Breach</em> turn, the game politely tells you <em>exactly</em> what each enemy character is going to do, down the exact square they'll end on and how much damage they'll inflict. There are no hit percentages, no random events, no luck; each turn is a puzzle, with definitive answers to how exactly you're going to come out on top.</p><p><em>Into the Breach </em>battles are short, and being a roguelike, designed to be very replayable. Once you've mastered the basics and reached the end, there are numerous different mechs with new attack and defense mechanics to learn and master as you mix-and-match to build your favorite team. If you're a fan of either puzzle or turn-based strategy games, this is a must-have.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDZXTExIWEM5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbqryi76xo7iqi0OSiZFdJ2qtoRw36MWbouVYggK6l2N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB06WLLHXC9"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</em></a> signals the biggest shift in the series since the Nintendo 64's <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, and it might well be one of the best games of the past decade.

There's crafting, weapons that degrade, almost too much to collect and do and a gentle story hidden away for players to discover for themselves.

The first release from Estonian studio ZA/UM, it's a sprawling science-fiction RPG that takes more inspiration from D&amp;D and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> than modern combat-focused games. In fact, there is no combat to speak of, instead, you'll be creating your character, choosing what their strengths and weaknesses are, and then passing D&amp;D-style skill checks to make your way through the story. You'll, of course, be leveling up your abilities and boosting stats with items, but really the game's systems fall away in place of a truly engaging story, featuring some of the finest writing to ever grace a video game.</p><p>With the <em>Final Cut</em>, released 18 months after the original, this extremely dialogue-heavy game now has full voice acting, which brings the unique world more to life than ever before. After debuting on PC, PS5 and Stadia, <em>Final Cut </em>is now available for all extant home consoles ‚Äì including Nintendo‚Äôs Switch. Loading times are a little slower than on other systems, so it might not be the absolute best platform to play it on, but <em>Disco Elysium</em> is an experience unlike the rest of the Switch library, which is why it makes it on this list.</p><h2>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NYXJpby1LYXJ0LURlbHV4ZS1OaW50ZW5kby1EaWdpdGFsL2RwL0IwMU4xMDM3Q1Y_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjOWVhNzc3LTI0YzItNDRiZS05MzZkLWJkNWE1NDQzNWNjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW8YM_F6RFQfAdeTnF8fGsF8NAwrfCWh1NDrqu6ew53s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMario-Kart-Deluxe-Nintendo-Digital%2Fdp%2FB01N1037CV"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's</em></a> vibrancy and attention to detail prove it's a valid upgrade to the Wii U original.

The music, sound effects, art style, level design and variety of moves you can pull off all contribute to this vibe ‚Äî and even though the game looks entirely different from its predecessors, the end result is the same: skateboarding bliss.</p><h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser‚Äôs Fury</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdXBlci1NYXJpby0zRC1Xb3JsZC1Cb3dzZXJzLUZ1cnkvZHAvQjA4SkNaS1RRVz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGM5ZWE3NzctMjRjMi00NGJlLTkzNmQtYmQ1YTU0NDM1Y2NmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARXXJoTVtkNmLtCudO6r_x5ITfcqG3hm0igXTYdBnGUH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSuper-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury%2Fdp%2FB08JCZKTQW"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was unfairly slept on when it originally launched in 2013, mostly due to the fact very few people had a Wii U. It's a superb translation of old-school Mario mechanics into 3D (<em>Mario 64</em> is a masterpiece, yes, but unless you're a speed-runner it doesn't quite have the pace of the NES and SNES games). It's also a great multiplayer game, as you can play simultaneously with three other players and race through levels ‚Äî the winner of each level gets to wear a crown in the next.</p><p>With the move to the Switch, and Nintendo finally starting to figure out online gaming, you can now do that remotely, which is a huge plus. The bigger addition is <em>Bowser's Fury</em>, an all-new game of sorts that plays more like a blend of <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>and <em>3D World. </em>There are some really creative challenges that feel right out of <em>Odyssey</em>, blended with the lightness and speed of the Wii U game. (It should be noted that <em>Bowser's Fury</em> is also only good for one or two players, unlike the main game.)

There are about 80 characters to test out here (although 10 of them are locked behind DLC).</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdXBlci1TbWFzaC1Ccm9zLVVsdGltYXRlLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDdETUZSTkY5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzllYTc3Ny0yNGMyLTQ0YmUtOTM2ZC1iZDVhNTQ0MzVjY2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAenCRbEIi5oXDPq0wplecE47mLr-yOd2eU38dX9NtUQe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07DMFRNF9%3F"><em>Super Smash Bros.

<p>Game developer King said today it‚Äôs shutting down <em>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run</em>.

All in-app purchases are already turned off, and players will have until the game‚Äôs last day to spend any purchased purple crystals.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game was an auto-runner in the vein of <em>Temple Run</em>.

Our technical wizards in the Studio are already busy putting their finishing touches to more exciting features and islands which will be available very soon.‚Äù Although it isn‚Äôt shocking that a developer‚Äôs (possibly outsourced) customer-support team would be left in the dark about an unannounced cancellation, it‚Äôs harder to excuse suggesting to a fan the game is about to receive exciting new content when it was actually on its deathbed.</p><p>Crash Bandicoot fans still have adventures to look forward to on bigger screens.

<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/fortnite"><em><ins>Fortnite</ins></em></a> maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games/"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a> will pay $520 million to settle allegations that it violated the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/coppa/"><ins>COPPA</ins></a>) and &quot;tricked millions of players into making unintentional purchases,&quot; using deceptive design strategies called dark patterns, the Federal Trade Commission said. The agency notes that there are two separate settlements, each of which broke FTC records.</p><p>Epic will pay $275 million for allegedly violating the COPPA rule as part of a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2223087EpicGamesSettlement.pdf"><ins>proposed federal court order</ins></a>. The agency says that's the largest penalty it has obtained to date over a rule violation. Epic will also refund customers $245 million over its billing practices and use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-21-dark-patterns-gives-name-and-definition-to-scammy-web-design-p.html/"><ins>dark patterns</ins></a>. The FTC claims that's the largest refund in a gaming-related case and its biggest administrative order to date. It will decide whether to finalize the consent order after a 30-day public comment period.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked <em>Fortnite </em>users, including teenagers and children,&quot; FTC chair Lina M.

The game generated $9 billion in profit between 2018 and 2019, and $5.1 billion in gross revenue in 2020.</p><p>The FTC claimed that Epic violated the COPPA rule by collecting personal data from <em>Fortnite </em>players aged under 13 without notifying or seeking consent from their parents. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2223087EpicGamesComplaint.pdf/"><ins>In its complaint</ins></a>, the FTC said parents who wanted Epic to delete personal information on their kids had to &quot;jump through extraordinary hoops&quot; and even then the company sometimes didn't honor those requests.</p><p>The agency also accused Epic of engaging in &quot;unfair practices&quot; and harming children and teens by enabling voice and text chat by default. &quot;Children and teens have been bullied, threatened, harassed and exposed to dangerous and psychologically traumatizing issues such as suicide while on <em>Fortnite</em>,&quot; the FTC claimed.</p><p>As part of the COPPA settlement, the FTC says there's a first-of-its-kind provision that forces Epic to have more stringent default privacy settings for kids and teens, including making sure that voice and text chat are off by default. The company also needs to delete personal data it has collected on <em>Fortnite </em>players unless a player says they're 13 or over or it gets parental consent to retain the information.</p><p>Earlier this month, Epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-cabined-accounts-kids-fortnite-fall-guys-rocket-league-metaverse-153028144.html"><ins>rolled out &quot;cabined accounts&quot;</ins></a> for young <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Fall Guys </em>and <em>Rocket League </em>players.

The agency said these design decisions led consumers to pay &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars in unauthorized charges.&quot;</p><p>The FTC said children were able to buy V-Bucks, <em>Fortnite</em>'s in-game currency, without parental consent until 2018. &quot;Some parents complained that their children had racked up hundreds of dollars in charges before they realized Epic had charged their credit card without their consent,&quot; the agency noted. The FTC has targeted the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-10-ftc-amazon.html"><ins>Amazon</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-10-google-in-app-purchase-ftc-refund.html"><ins>Google</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-15-apple-settles-with-ftc-agrees-to-pay-out-32-5-million-to-custo.html"><ins>Apple</ins></a> for similar reasons in the past.</p><p>On top of that, Epic allegedly locked the accounts of users who disputed unauthorized payments with their credit card companies. The FTC said Epic ignored more than a million user complaints and employee concerns over wrongful charges.</p><p>Along with the $245 million Epic will pay to cover refunds, the proposed consent order seeks to block it from using dark patterns to charge users or otherwise charge them without obtaining explicit consent. Epic will also agree not to enact blanket bans for accounts that perform chargebacks, only disabling those it suspects of actual fraud. The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/fortnite"><ins>will send emails</ins></a> to those who made <em>Fortnite </em>in-game purchases when it has more details to share about the refund program.</p><div id="234f2f736b65499185c688f8f29472bd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Epic Games creator of the video game Fortnite, to pay a total of $520 million over FTC allegations Epic violated the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act and deployed dark patterns to dupe millions of players into making unintentional purchases: <a href="https://t.co/yHaQx8VXlu">https://t.co/yHaQx8VXlu</a></p>‚Äî FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1604841410418466816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true"><ins>said in a lengthy statement</ins></a> that, among other things, it has &quot;restored thousands of accounts that were banned due to reported chargebacks under our previous policy.&quot; Payment information will no longer be saved by default, with users offered the chance to opt out.

## The Dyson Zone headset is comfy enough to sleep with, but still makes you look like Bane

<p>When I first checked out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dyson-zone-headphones-mask-wearable-air-filtration-device-050027799.html">Dyson Zone in March</a>, the company didn't allow us to take our own photos of video of the demos, since they were still a ways from production. Now that we have new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dyson-zone-noise-canceling-headphones-pricing-availability-announced-000119196.html">details about the pricing and availability</a> of Dyson's air-purifying headphones, the company invited us to check out the device again, this time with video. The Dyson Zone will be available in March at a starting price of $950.</p><p>My second experience with the Dyson Zone was very similar to the first, except I was able to test it in more situations. Our video producer Joel Chokkattu and I were accompanied by a company rep while we took the headset out on the streets of New York, walking around for a block on a rainy day. As expected, passersby gawked when I snapped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bane_(DC_Comics)">Bane-like</a> visor onto the headset, and one person even turned their head in shock.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To see if the Zone would be comfortable enough for me to wear on a long flight, which is how I believe most people would want to use it, I laid out on a couch with the entire device on. It wasn't terrible. We also got to check out the companion app and see a live chart showing the sound levels in our surroundings.</p><div id="e79df0616abf4114ae52bf5dc9524537"></div><p>As a reminder, the Dyson Zone is not designed to protect against COVID-19 or other viruses. It does not seal to your face, even if the visor does cover your nose and mouth. It does leave the chin exposed, and there's a gap between the device and your skin. You can use inserts like an N95 mask attachment that the company offers as part of a package, but on its own the Zone is only getting rid of particles and acidic gasses like nitrogen dioxide and ozone.</p><p>For the full details, check out our video above and let us know what you think!</p>

Its battery doesn't last nearly as long as something like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html">Switch Pro Controller</a>, but it's an improvement over the PS4's pad, and it's rechargeable through a USB-C port.

<p>While plenty of gadgets cross our desks, we at Engadget also end up buying a lot of things for ourselves throughout the year. In 2022, some of us <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">upgraded our TVs</a> while others invested in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-tempered-glass-lid-slow-cooking-review-143053689.html">new cookware</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lume-cube-edge-light-irl-143059698.html">desk</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-yeti-nano-microphone-irl-143058272.html">accessories</a> that upped our productivity. But there are plenty of things we've been loving recently that haven't made it onto the site. Here, our staffers look back on the year that was by gushing about their favorite items they bought this year.</p><h2>Nest Hub Max</h2><figure><img alt="Google Nest Hub Max" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/439d0550-77ea-11ed-bbf7-f21ead352a14" style="height: 1200; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>I got a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtSHViLU1heC1DaGFsay80MjUzNTQzNDQ_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzcyMjRlZi0wODRkLTRjZjYtOTgyOS1lOTI4YzVmMDZkZmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQElCLxGe1jtzJCxf3eEeSbFSUQzhUG4357IkDkNmWpo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Chalk%2F425354344%3F">Nest Hub Max</a> last year for Christmas and over the past 12 months, it‚Äôs probably brought me more joy than any other gadget. By setting Google Photos to automatically upload pictures of my son to an album linked to the Nest Hub, every day I‚Äôm treated to a slideshow of all the fun times we‚Äôve had. When people say kids grow up fast, they‚Äôre totally right. But as a photo viewer with voice controls, the Nest Hub max lets me relive those memories while being also an important part of my smart home control center. <em>‚Äì Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>55-inch LG B2 OLED smart TV</h2><figure><img alt="55-inch LG B2 OLED smart TV" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f744e860-770a-11ed-97db-3858c2868352" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>In prioritizing big purchases for our new home, I knew I wanted to get a better TV and soon. Not only did we need a new one quickly for our living room while my fiance used our old one in the basement he‚Äôd claimed as his man cave, but I also wanted to see if I could get a good deal during Amazon‚Äôs October Prime Day event. I ultimately decided to splurge on the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MRy01NS1JbmNoLVJlZnJlc2gtQUktUG93ZXJlZC1PTEVENTVCMlBVQS9kcC9CMDlSTU5EMjlCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzcyMjRlZi0wODRkLTRjZjYtOTgyOS1lOTI4YzVmMDZkZmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ6KB-niouG0HXLLKj6LxexJ0TvUdJY1ATmKkC6gQ-xe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLG-55-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED55B2PUA%2Fdp%2FB09RMND29B">55-inch LG B2 OLED smart TV</a> when it dipped under $1,000 during that period. To say the difference from our old LED TV was instantly noticeable is not hyperbole: as soon as we set the thing up, we were stunned by the quality. Blacks are deep and colors are much more vibrant than on any TV we‚Äôve had before.</p><p>We‚Äôve watched a lot of things on it so far, from live sports to documentaries to sitcoms and everything looks much sharper and more colorful than we‚Äôre used to. We‚Äôre also pleasantly surprised by LG‚Äôs webOS. This is the first TV we‚Äôve used with it and it was super easy to get accustomed to. We like how you can customize your homescreen and navigate either with the arrow keys on the remote or the convenient little cursor that flies around the TV screen. We now refer to it as the ‚Äúgood TV‚Äù in the house, with my fianc√© opting to watch his weekly sports games on the B2 rather than in his basement sanctuary. <em>‚Äî Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Chase Bliss Gen Loss v2</h2><figure><img alt="Chase Bliss Gen Loss v2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/ddb6b5e0-74a8-11ed-bd7e-41f09cf27f1f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chase Bliss</div></figure><p>I have made no bones about my love of all things lo-fi and broken. What can I say? I like warbles. In my quest to make every instrument I own sound like it‚Äôs coming out of an old tape player I‚Äôve tried a number of things, but in June I pre-ordered the <a href="https://www.chasebliss.com/generation-loss-mkii">Generation Loss MKII</a> and I think my search is now complete.</p><p>The Generation Loss is one of the most popular lo-fi pedals ever made, and last year its creator, Tom Majeski of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cooper-fx-arcades-review-lo-fi-guitar-multi-effects-pedal-stompbox-music-120043113.html">Cooper FX</a>, joined the relentless experimenters at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chase-bliss-habit-review-guitar-effects-pedal-delay-looper-130017678.html">Chase Bliss</a>. One of the first orders of business was updating his classic pedal. It‚Äôs pitched as a ‚ÄúVHS duplicator,‚Äù but that is greatly underselling things. While the original Gen Loss was just sort of a generalized tape simulator, the MKII version digs into the highly specific sonic characteristics of a variety of tape-based devices.</p><p>The company pulled apart and analyzed VHS players, Tascam Portastudios and dictaphones in an effort to find out what makes them unique. It covers everything from the subtle frequency drop off of old ¬º-inch tape running through a reel-to-reel machine, all the way to the crushed hum that results when you make a copy of a copy of a VHS cassette. And if you‚Äôre not into the newer version that faithfully recreates particular tape formats, you can always throw one of Chase Bliss‚Äô patented dip switches to turn on classic mode. <em>‚Äî Terrence O'Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Apple MagSafe Duo charger</h2><figure><img alt="Apple MagSafe Duo charger" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/a1886e80-75a5-11ed-a6c7-e9ea2183c13a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>I‚Äôll admit it: My favorite gadget of the year is, well, something I bought last year. In spring 2021,I picked up <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NSFhGM0FNLUEtTWFnU2FmZS1DaGFyZ2VyL2RwL0IwOE1XUjJOWFo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tYnktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjczNzIyNGVmLTA4NGQtNGNmNi05ODI5LWU5MjhjNWYwNmRmZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARG4qaNBwcVytg4J22BBSbKmA2HmqeDp0AfZoIZdhtPm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MHXF3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger%2Fdp%2FB08MWR2NXZ">Apple‚Äôs MagSafe Duo charger</a>, which can charge both your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, all in a fold-up, compact form factor. While I could (and have) used it at home to charge my Apple devices overnight, I picked it up as a compact charging kit for when I traveled. As we all know, 2021 was not the year for roaming the globe. But as travel restrictions were lifted this year, I finally got to see if the pricey charger was worth the investment.</p><p>Yes, $129 was a lot for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-price-163247816.html">dual charger</a>, but it fulfilled the brief of using just a single cable and being so much more compact than most rival Apple Watch standup chargers. It unfurls like a makeup compact, meaning it can slip into anyone‚Äôs luggage with ease. Yes, I could take the Apple Watch cable, but in recent years these cables have USB-C, not USB-A sockets. Unfortunately, a lot of hotels (and charging plugs) still don‚Äôt have those, and if I‚Äôm visiting a different country, there are only so many things I can charge at once with a travel adapter.</p><p>After unfolding the two sides, the magnetic puck for Watch charging can also be folded out at 90 degrees, attaching to the wearable and allowing me to see the time when it‚Äôs set up. The small footprint means it fits on most nightstands and bedside tables at hotels, guest rooms and even window ledges. If space is at a premium, you can fold it around to charge a single device, whether that‚Äôs the watch or your iPhone. The MagSafe charger spot can also wirelessly recharge my AirPods if I ensure they‚Äôre in the correct position.</p><p>It‚Äôs not perfect. I‚Äôm increasingly frustrated at the sluggish charging speed when wirelessly charging my iPhone  ‚Äì even if this isn‚Äôt a problem when charging overnight. Hopefully, Apple will bring out another model that‚Äôs hopefully cheaper and faster to charge. When Apple eventually ditches Lightning, it‚Äôll need to make a new one anyway. <em>‚Äì Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2>Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro</h2><figure><img alt="Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/00c4e740-74aa-11ed-bbd7-300408d1bfee" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bissell</div></figure><p>Our new house has carpet on the second floor and, while it‚Äôs in pretty good shape, there were some stains we wanted to remove if possible before moving in. We also have a cat who occasionally eats too fast and, well, I probably don‚Äôt have to tell you the rest. Investing in a spot cleaner seemed like a no-brainer, and I‚Äôm glad I went with <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CSVNTRUxMLVNwb3RDbGVhbi1Qb3J0YWJsZS1DbGVhbmVyLTI0NTgvZHAvQjA3RDQ2U1E2Mz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzcyMjRlZi0wODRkLTRjZjYtOTgyOS1lOTI4YzVmMDZkZmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATEgT3JzTBj76Ymr0dE0Jy_QhSuwmhimBAef-0dSaQj0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBISSELL-SpotClean-Portable-Cleaner-2458%2Fdp%2FB07D46SQ63%3Fth%3D1">Bissell‚Äôs SpotClean Pet Pro</a>. It‚Äôs fairly light at 13 pounds and not very big, so I can tote it around by its carrying handle to any place in my home. All you have to do is fill the solution tank with the proper ratio of cleaning liquid and water, plug the machine in, turn it on and use the included handle to scrub away stains.</p><p>I first used it on some of the carpet‚Äôs existing mystery marks and they easily came out after a few minutes of elbow-greased scrubbing. The SpotClean‚Äôs handle has a button that lets you control the amount of solution it sprays out, and while it‚Äôs running, it‚Äôs constantly sucking up excess water, filling up a separate tank with the dirty bits. The hardest part of using it is the scrubbing you have to do, and how much weight you want to put into it is totally up to you. I found most light stains came out quickly and without too much effort on my part, but I did spend more time on tougher spots. I also love that I can use this to deep clean upholstered furniture, like our old couch which is in desperate need of a refresh. This spot cleaner certainly isn‚Äôt the sexiest purchase I‚Äôve made for our new home, but it‚Äôs one that will keep it looking fresh and clean for longer. <em>‚Äî V.P.</em></p><h2>Tushy Classic Bidet 3.0</h2><figure><img alt="Tushy Classic Bidet 3.0" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/17a3b360-74aa-11ed-bd0b-b701652e185e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tushy</div></figure><p>Everyone likes a clean butthole. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a controversial thing to say. But while toilet paper does a decent enough job, sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt get the area clean enough. Which means you end up using more TP, potentially clogging the toilet in the process, and you still might not feel like it‚Äôs completely clean. That‚Äôs why I recently purchased the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4575e0b1-b33e-4c92-a569-3d6154fc2a1c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TUSHY&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NTc1ZTBiMS1iMzNlLTRjOTItYTU2OS0zZDYxNTRmYzJhMWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxsb3R1c2h5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9jbGFzc2ljLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtYmlkZXQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjczNzIyNGVmLTA4NGQtNGNmNi05ODI5LWU5MjhjNWYwNmRmZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVgp6XZ7XiriaXD9HWUNU7mkgypYUIvXnJ0Eot9WBIjs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Fclassic-affordable-bidet">Tushy Classic 3.0</a>, an affordable bidet that can fit with my existing toilet.</p><p>I‚Äôve long wanted one of those fancy Japanese bidet toilets. But not only are they expensive, they require remodeling my bathroom with an additional outlet, which I simply can‚Äôt justify at the moment. The Tushy Classic 3.0, on the other hand, is only $130 or so, and it gets the job done at a fraction of the cost. Installing it is easy. All we did was attach it to our existing plumbing and we were done in about 10 minutes. It doesn‚Äôt use any electricity either. Turning the knob adjusts the water pressure while moving the toggle adjusts the angle of the spray nozzle.</p><p>We‚Äôve been using it for a few months now, and we really do love it. We almost look forward to going number two, which is a strange thing to say. As a woman with monthly menstruation, I really appreciate that it helps get me much cleaner than with toilet paper alone. I think we end up using less TP as a result, too. I‚Äôd probably want to upgrade to a fancier bidet in the future, but for now, the Tushy Classic 3.0 more than does the job. <em>‚Äî Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Blueland hand soap</h2><figure><img alt="Blueland hand soap" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/22faaf70-74aa-11ed-b864-08aec7dcb73b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blueland</div></figure><p>Before we moved into our new home, we had nearly exhausted the available storage in our apartment. Our tiny bathrooms had little to no space to store extra hand soap, bath wash and other necessities, so I resorted to stuffing our linen closet to the brim ‚Äì so much so that I had to lean on the door to get it to close properly. So I turned to Blueland, which makes <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibHVlbGFuZC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvaGFuZC1zb2FwLXJlZmlsbC1wYWNrcz9vcHRpb249MCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzM3MjI0ZWYtMDg0ZC00Y2Y2LTk4MjktZTkyOGM1ZjA2ZGZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdC4qgp_QFJdwcyRSAnSg07AccAfidUoDrvU5KmG460K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blueland.com%2Fproducts%2Fhand-soap-refill-packs%3Foption%3D0">hand soap</a>, cleaning supplies and the like that come in small tablets inside compostable pouches, and most of their formulas are plant-based, vegan and more environmentally friendly than cleaners you‚Äôll find in big-box stores. All you do is drop the formula tablet into a container of water, shake it up and let it sit for a while until the whole tablet dissolves and then you can use the product.</p><p>I was immediately impressed with the foaming hand soap for a few reasons. First, a couple of packets took up significantly less space than even a refill jug of the soap I was previously buying, plus I liked the fact that I was purchasing one less plastic bottle by switching. Second, the soap actually worked as advertised. I had tried a couple of eco-conscious hand and dish soaps before this, and most of them had left me disappointed because I felt like they didn‚Äôt clean as well as standard solutions. But Blueland‚Äôs hand soap foamed up nicely and actually left my hands feeling clean after every wash, with no weird residue left behind.</p><p>I started off using the tablets in a mason jar outfitted with a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KYXJtYXppbmctUHJvZHVjdHMtTWFzb24tRm9hbWluZy1EaXNwZW5zZXIvZHAvQjA3Q0JGN0MyWT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1ieS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzM3MjI0ZWYtMDg0ZC00Y2Y2LTk4MjktZTkyOGM1ZjA2ZGZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS78ALv-UDshqEAytf7gzm3zhoJpLZX5ZESJMaEHp364&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJarmazing-Products-Mason-Foaming-Dispenser%2Fdp%2FB07CBF7C2Y">foaming pump lid</a>, but I‚Äôve since graduated to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibHVlbGFuZC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvaGFuZC1zb2FwLWR1b3M_b3B0aW9uPTYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjczNzIyNGVmLTA4NGQtNGNmNi05ODI5LWU5MjhjNWYwNmRmZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARvPcJXx-INyEFuBdmnzZJEXN-_KhmxNxaE6uVvREaoE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blueland.com%2Fproducts%2Fhand-soap-duos%3Foption%3D6">Blueland‚Äôs own glass hand soap bottles</a>, which are hefty and luxe.

The only issue was that, even the relatively light XF 35mm f/2 bought was a little too bulky to go <em>everywhere.</em> I ended up snagging one of <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/lenses/xf27mmf28-r-wr/">Fuji‚Äôs 27mm pancake lenses</a> used a few months back, and it‚Äôs barely left my camera since. More importantly, my camera has barely left my side since.</p><p>With this lens the X-T30 comfortably fits in my <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZmllbGQtcG91Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzcyMjRlZi0wODRkLTRjZjYtOTgyOS1lOTI4YzVmMDZkZmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQjgxkvq7ONUOGxBrf-mJejUHXn95bIHUi4a90L0Vkhu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Ffield-pouch%2F">Peak Design Field Pouch</a>, along with a cleaning cloth and brush, a notebook and pen, plus my keys. It‚Äôs so easy to just grab everything no matter where it is that I‚Äôm going. To my parents‚Äô for a birthday dinner? Sure. Grocery shopping? Why not? Just around the block to walk my dog? Seems silly not to.</p><p>Obviously, the big feature here is size, but it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre making a lot of tradeoffs to get there either. Images taken with the 27mm are insanely sharp. Even wide open at F/2.8 the corners are crisp and contrasty. Would a larger aperture have been nice? Sure. But this is plenty for street photography and family snapshots. My version doesn‚Äôt have an aperture ring sadly, but the newer model does. Honestly, my one real complaint is that the minimum focus distance is about 13.4 inches, and I often find myself wanting to get closer to my subject. Still, this is probably the best investment I‚Äôve made in my budding love of photography. <em>‚Äî T.O.</em></p><h2>Anyday Everyday cookware set</h2><figure><img alt="Anyday product shoot in Napa, Calif.

The bowls themselves are made from thicker, thermal shock-resistant frosted glass so they'll better withstand temperature fluctuations without cracking. The lids keep steam in the dish to cook your food, and have vents to let out the excess. A silicone rim expands to accommodate extra pressure, and the stainless steel in the lids is curved in a way that Anyday says makes it "100% microwave-safe."</p><p>As someone who mostly prizes convenience when it comes to cooking, I'm enamored with my Anyday bowls. I love steaming eggs and fish filets, but I can also cook rice, vegetables, pasta, and make nut butters, cakes and pretty much anything in the microwave with this system. Of course, anything requiring a sear, deep fry or broil won't work, and some of the recipes the company shared on its website are too complicated for my liking. But for making healthy steamed meals, the Anyday system is honestly a godsend (or friendsend). Best part: they're dishwasher safe, so I don't need to deal with the cleanup after. <em>‚Äî Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2>Madewell Zip-Top Transport Crossbody</h2><figure><img alt="Madewell Zip-Top Transport Crossbody" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/7ebb4d60-74aa-11ed-b7ff-c8a00c0ed7c2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Madewell</div></figure><p>My go-to bag for years has been the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2FuZHNvbnMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BlYXJsLXNhZmZpYW5vLWxlYXRoZXItbGlnaHQtZ3JleS1nb2xkLWdyZXkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjczNzIyNGVmLTA4NGQtNGNmNi05ODI5LWU5MjhjNWYwNmRmZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbokLTbRIfFoMiaHGgXo36cEUPO30I2eMnjTCYZGV7S4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fproducts%2Fpearl-saffiano-leather-light-grey-gold-grey">Pearl crossbody from Lo &amp; Sons</a>, which I love for its compact size and multiple compartments.

The shoulder straps are detachable so I can swap them out if I want, or I can use just the top handles by themselves. The best thing about it for me is its size: at around 10 x 10 x 3 inches, it‚Äôs small enough to not weigh me down, but it‚Äôs also surprisingly roomy. It fits all my essentials and then some. That includes my wallet, phone, keys, earbuds, pens, my <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2">Kobo Libra 2 e-reader</a>, a portable battery and, if I wedge it in correctly, even my <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Guide-to-the-Hobonichi-Techo-Planner/pt/900">Hobonichi Techo planner</a>.</p><p>That said, I wish it had more compartments. It only has two inside pockets, which themselves are not that big. As a result, it‚Äôs easy for smaller items to get lost; I often have to spend time searching for my lipstick or hand sanitizer. My current solution is to keep these items in a separate small makeup pouch that can fit inside the bag so that it‚Äôs easier to fish out.

I still need to wash the bottle every so often, of course, but so far my water has never tasted like anything other than water.</p><p>This might seem like a pointless thing to brag about, but the Mover just feels nice, too. Its textured finish is pleasing to the touch, and its simple design looks high-end ‚Äì for a water bottle, at least. There are multiple lid and size options available; I went with the 18-ounce model and ‚ÄúUnion‚Äù spout cap, which has been fine, though the lid tends to make a whistling sound that sounds uncannily like hitting a bong. (Be warned if you‚Äôre ever off-camera during a work call.) I still can‚Äôt tell anyone they <em>should</em> spend this much on a water bottle, but the Mover does the thing I want, and I‚Äôm spending way less on wasteful plastic bottles as a result. <em>‚Äî Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p>

Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a grassroots effort which officially established itself last April, secured a win against tremendous odds, less than a year after forming. Those odds, incidentally, included <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/19/amazon-union-worker-nlrb-staten-island/">retaliatory firings</a> of leaders, using police to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3abjz3/watch-nypd-arrests-amazon-union-organizers-at-staten-island-warehouse">intimidate and arrest</a> organizers and an (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-overruled-in-labor-case-staten-island-union-vote-115612295.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANgcvvgaLgSEm5cxdPeS0RcglA2NwlrwCBh5OL-VXnJAAmQUrS6vVHdqSlq0lRAs0SzM_nMOLyvXl7JyYCVfjRAUPar4uY6JGr6M3gP22np6e0NPCXSpsVLlYqsW3w8jSLTvbDkB48pDOUIpuIzRPCsdy5a_8gsHW8BmvnHXX3y4">unsuccessful</a>) attempt to overturn the unionization vote. Amazon has previously <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/amazon-illegally-interfered-in-alabama-warehouse-vote-union-alleges.html">illegally</a> interfered with a union election and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp3yn/amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements">reportedly</a> retains the services of operatives from the infamous Pinkerton agency to spy on workers and labor groups. The company's new CEO, Andy Jassy, recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/nlrb-says-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-violated-labor-laws.html">violated labor laws</a> in several interviews by openly stating his employees would be ‚Äúbetter off without a union.‚Äù This is all to say ALU had a tremendous uphill climb and, incredibly, managed to pull it off.</p><p>As with Apple though, what we're talking about is a first step. The company has not bargained a contract yet with workers from ALU, and will likely forestall and undermine that process as much as possible, whether by legal or illegal means.</p><p>ALU's organizing efforts have branched out but have so far not found the same success. A warehouse in upstate New York voted overwhelmingly against unionization. However, management had put up digital banners at the same location ahead of its organizing drive instructing workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alb-1-anti-union-signage-alu-004207814.html">specifically not to sign union cards</a>, again in apparent contravention of labor law. ALU <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/tech/amazon-labor-union-california-withdraw-petition/index.html">withdrew</a> a union petition to organize a warehouse in California in October, but has remained open to refiling. Apart from ALU, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/teamsters-president-elect-talks-strategy-for-organizing-amazon">claimed</a> last December that organizing Amazon facilities would be a top priority ‚Äî seemingly it has focused those efforts on an Amazon Air hub in San Bernardino, where workers have walked out in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/amazon-workers-walked-out-over-pay-safety-fears-at-california-air-hub.html">August</a> and <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/san-bernardino-amazon-workers-walk-off-job-in-protest-of-pay-working-conditions-retaliation/">October</a>. The surrounding area ‚Äî California's inland empire ‚Äî is believed to be home to the highest density of Amazon facilities in the company's logistics network.</p><p>Microsoft, too, received an early Christmas present in the form of quality assurance testers at its subsidiary ZeniMax Media <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quality-assurance-staff-microsoft-zenimax-media-unionization-222142495.html">announcing</a> their intention to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. While that election has not yet taken place, Microsoft's president Brad Smith penned a lengthy screed earlier this year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unions-principles-brad-smith-225749615.html">supposedly</a> espousing the company's openness to union representation within its ranks. To many (this author especially) Brad's words were hot air intended to assuage regulators who are weighing whether to allow the company to merge with games giant Activision-Blizzard. Incidentally if that deal goes through, Microsoft will be home to three bargaining units: this past year QA testers at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-activision-blizzard-union-game-workers-alliance-195516977.html">Raven Software</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/activision-blizzard-game-testers-vote-form-union-2022-12-02/">Blizzard Albany</a> successfully joined the CWA in May and December, respectively, becoming the first workers not only at Activision but at any major games publisher to do so.</p><p>Necessarily a huge number of other labor actions in the tech space have been left out of this recollection, but for the most part they fit the pattern above: lower-paid workers at wildly profitable companies whose wages have not even remotely kept up with inflation. Adding insult to injury, tech companies, broadly, did <em>extremely</em> well during the pandemic while these same frontline workers risked their health and safety. Then this year, once economic forecasts became gloomier, many were swept up in downsizing decisions. It's perfectly logical Amazon warehouse workers, games testers at Microsoft and Activision, <a href="https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2022/08/22/meta-service-workers-gather-to-protest-layoffs-and-alleged-union-busting">support staff</a> at Meta, cafeteria workers with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/05/google-union-pandemic/">Alphabet</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/workers-form-union-waymo-googles-self-driving-car-company-rcna51414">Waymo</a>, janitors at Twitter and retail associates at Apple, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fiber-unio-vote-cwa-192732483.html">Google Fiber</a> and <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/verizon-express-retail-workers-in-portland-vote-form-union-communications-workers-of">Verizon</a> would be unhappy with their work arrangements.

Things aren't working. The hand they've been dealt is unwinnable. And though an imperfect tool, unions are one of the few ways workers can attempt to renegotiate the terms.</p><p>Unfortunately, labor law in the US leaves much to be desired. Companies have incredible power to delay bargaining, wearing down their own workforces by attrition while cooking up excuses to fire, lay off or manage out organizing leaders. Even after the hurdle of winning a union election, according to Bloomberg Law, the mean negotiation time to secure a contract is <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-how-long-does-it-take-unions-to-reach-first-contracts">over 13 months</a> ‚Äî and many take significantly longer. The penalties for breaking labor law are so minimal, especially for companies of Big Tech's size, as to be non-existent. Whether this groundswell of organizing continues to grow in the coming year remains in every way an open question, depending at least in part on economic realities. With layoffs continuing to ravage not just frontline workers but higher-wage tech jobs, there's reasons enough to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-05/twitter-faces-more-legal-fallout-over-worker-firings-under-musk?sref=x0Hy64pu">suspect</a> it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-corporate-employees-discuss-forming-union-unionization-2022-11">might</a>.</p>

## European Commission tells Meta that Facebook Marketplace is unfair to rivals

<p>Europe has hit Facebook owner Meta with a complaint that its Marketplace classified service is unfair to competitors. By tying its main social media site to Marketplace, it has a &quot;substantial distribution advantage&quot; over rivals, the EU Commission wrote in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7728">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;With its Facebook social network, Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions active advertisers,&quot; EU Antitrust Commissioner said in a statement. &quot;Our preliminary concern is that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services called Facebook Marketplace. This means that users of Facebook automatically have access to Facebook Marketplace, whether they want it or not.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the Commission found that Meta imposes imposes unfair trading conditions on competitors that advertise on Facebook or Instagram. That essentially allows it to use &quot;ads-related data derived from competitors for the benefit of Facebook Marketplace,&quot; it said. The practices, if confirmed, would infringe on EU rules that prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position. The EU has the power to impose a fine of up to 10 percent of Meta's annual revenue and prohibit the behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, Meta's head of EMEA competition said the &quot;claims made by the European Commission are without foundation&quot; and that the company &quot;will continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, the EU Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-facebook-antitrust-probe-105245913.html">launched</a> an antitrust probe into Facebook's classified advertising practices to determine if it broke competition rules by using advertiser data to its own benefit. The so-called Statement of Objects released today is a formal step in EU antitrust investigations, informing parties of complaints raised against them. Meta can now examine the documents, reply in writing and request an oral hearing to present their comments, according to the Commission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two types of people in this world: those with naked iPhones and those who stick their handset in a case as soon as they unbox it. If you just got a new phone and fall into the latter category, you have an overwhelming range of options to consider. It‚Äôs easy to fall down a rabbit hole, researching iPhone cases from companies you‚Äôve never heard of on Amazon. You may be tempted to get one of the cheapest options available, or maybe the one with the cutest pattern, but they might not be the best iPhone cases for your needs. We tested out a number of the latest cases, covers and protectors to see which are actually worth your money.</p><h2>Spigen Ultra Hybrid Magfit</h2><p></p><p>If you want a basic, protective case that comes at an affordable price, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvU3BpZ2VuL3BhZ2UvMUI2QjQ5MzMtMEQyMS00RkY0LUFCMzctRjc0Q0Q0RjVDQjFDP3JlZl89YXN0X2JsbiZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1iei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzI1YzA3NDctZjg3ZC00YzhmLWEzODItNGI3NmY5MWIyMjY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWXXzLXDP3NWu4yUddNUFfEOTC0JLYp3_uQZtsXH8akF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FSpigen%2Fpage%2F1B6B4933-0D21-4FF4-AB37-F74CD4F5CB1C%3Fref_%3Dast_bln">Spigen</a> has you covered.

The cases also have tactical buttons on the side that make it easy to feel around and adjust your phone‚Äôs volume without even looking at it. The overall slim profile of the case allows it to protect your iPhone without adding too much bulk, and it‚Äôs MagSafe compatible as well. Also, the Ultra Hybrid case was one of the most secure we tried ‚Äì to the point where it was almost difficult to extricate the iPhone when we needed to test out a new cover.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oneplus/"><ins>OnePlus</ins></a> has revealed when it will formally show off its flagship products for 2023. The Cloud 11 event will take place in New Delhi, India, on February 7th. The company will showcase the OnePlus 11 5G, OnePlus Buds Pro 2 and more.</p><p>Along with revealing the event date, OnePlus said it would bring a couple of fan-favorite features back for its next flagship smartphone. The OnePlus 11 will once again feature the company's Alert Slider, which offers an easy way to shift between silent, vibrate and alert modes. You can expect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-and-9-pro-official-141121859.html"><ins>Hasselblad tuning</ins></a> for the camera system as well. Both features were available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-10-pro-review-specs-price-camera-comparison-143032415.html"><ins>OnePlus Pro 10</ins></a>, but neither were present on the more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-10-t-review-speed-above-all-specs-price-availability-153054303.html"><ins>budget-friendly 10T</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, the company said they'll offer &quot;a full-bodied, stereo-quality audio experience with crystal clarity.&quot; OnePlus said it will have more to reveal beyond the smartphone and earbuds.</p><p>OnePlus, which recently promised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-os-security-updates-four-years-090049695.html"><ins>four years of major OS updates</ins></a> for some of its 2023 phones, will be looking to make a splash with its next batch of flagship devices. Although the company's original ethos was to build competitive smartphones it could sell at a lower price than market leaders, it has edged further into the premium category since then.

## The Morning After: Twitter briefly bans links to Facebook, Instagram and other rivals

<p>Could the state of Twitter get any worse? Of course it can. While a lot of us were glued to the World Cup final, the social network made major policy changes, deciding to halt any kind of ‚Äúfree promotion‚Äù of competing social media sites. Or, at least,<a href="https://store.eu.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/product/810845/final-fantasy-i-vi-pixel-remaster-ff35th-anniversary-edition-nswitch"> it did for a moment</a>.</p><p>Twitter announced yesterday it would remove links to Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Post and, er, Truth Social, from accounts whose &quot;main purpose&quot; is to promote content on those platforms. This includes links in Twitter bios and even, it seems, links to YouTube channels and profiles. The company would even restrict the use of third-party aggregators, like Linktree and Link.bio. Funnily enough, if you were willing to pay, you‚Äôd be fine. Twitter said it would continue to allow paid promotion for any of the platforms on its new prohibited list.</p><p>Twitter began enforcing the policy almost immediately. Yesterday, at 2:17 PM ET, Paul Graham, the founder of startup accelerator Y Combinator ‚Äì and Silicon Valley royalty ‚Äì said he was done with Twitter, following the rule change, and told his more than 1.5 million followers to find him on Mastodon. A few hours later, Twitter suspended Graham's account.</p><p>But then late last night, the official tweets announcing the link ban were deleted, as was the policy itself from Twitter‚Äôs website. So, well, we‚Äôre not entirely sure now. Musk also tweeted a poll asking if he should stick around as Twitter boss. At the moment, the answer is no.</p><p>‚Äì Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn‚Äôt just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> ‚Äì  it‚Äôs also a daily podcast.

<p>Yesterday Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-asks-twitter-users-to-decide-000451423.html">launched</a> another one of his famous Twitter policy polls, this time putting his own leadership on the line. &quot;Should I step down as head of Twitter?

Both may also be the first products in a rumored &quot;Optimo&quot; lineup of high-end speakers reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23319989/sonos-optimo-speaker-features-design"><em>The Verge</em></a> earlier this year. The Optimo 2 speaker (possibly a replacement for the Sonos Five) is supposed to support both WiFi and Bluetooth streaming, so that report lines up with the FCC filing. It could also have a USB-C wired line-in port, making it one of the few Sonos speakers with that feature.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>WiFi 6 and 6E could allow for more dependable streaming, particularly when using multiple speakers. Bluetooth, meanwhile, let you play music directly from a smartphone or other device. So far, Bluetooth streaming has only been present on Sonos' portable speakers. It's all still speculation until the products arrive, but given the FCC approvals, they should be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YouTube has removed PornHub's official channel over what it called &quot;multiple violations&quot; of its community guidelines, <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/youtube-removes-pornhub-1235464049/"><em>Variety</em></a> has reported.

## Kia‚Äôs EV6 GT crams performance into a great EV

<p>The Kia EV6 is an outstanding EV based on the Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP architecture. One of the more impressive elements of the crossover is that it charges at 240kW at compatible DC fast charging stations. That‚Äôs quicker than offerings from Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW and Ford, and it means less time at a station and more time on the road.</p><p>Now, Kia could have allowed quick charging to continue to be the electric crossover‚Äôs speediest feature. Instead, it decided to build something rather bonkers; an EV6 with a zero-to-60 time of 3.4 seconds, 576 horsepower, and 545 pound-feet of torque. It‚Äôs a quick electric crossover that in tests, outran a Lamborghini and Ferrari.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To get the full experience of the 2023 EV6 GT, Kia invited us to Las Vegas, Nevada where we drove the vehicle on twisty roads, a track, and a drag strip. Oh, and we also got a chance to try out the EV‚Äôs new Drift mode. Again, this is all in a Kia.</p><p>Check out the video below to see how well the vehicle performed both in the real world and on the track.</p><div id="db18db3e9eff4343a679055dfc25b46e"></div><p></p>

On the weekend of December 9th, Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny was scheduled to play two soldout shows in Mexico City‚Äôs Estadio Azteca, the largest stadium in Latin America.

<p>After implementing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-free-promotion-of-competing-platforms-182712974.html">unprecedented policy change</a> earlier in the day, Elon Musk took to Twitter on Sunday to ask his followers whether he should step down as the company's chief executive officer. &quot;Should I step down as head of Twitter?&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?s=20&amp;t=jqXKSgh_0RNjDk_n4ZcFXQ">he asked</a>, adding he would &quot;abide by the results of this poll.&quot; As of the writing of this article, the &quot;Yes&quot; option is leading with more than 2 million votes cast.
