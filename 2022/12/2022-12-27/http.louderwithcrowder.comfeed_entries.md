Suddenly, my Prepdeck and Bills Starter pullover seems lame in comparison to what Kristi Noem got. North Dakota's smokeshow of a governor got a flamethrower! A badass one too. Though, I'm not sure if there is such a thing as a non-badass flamethrower.</p><p>She showed off her new toy on a pile of unsuspecting cardboard boxes. That is one way to discard of the pile from Amazon that grows during the holidays.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WATCH: Governor of South Dakota <a href="https://twitter.com/KristiNoem?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KristiNoem</a> uses the flamethrower she got for Christmas <a href="https://t.co/PaNON7zod3">pic.twitter.com/PaNON7zod3</a><br />— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1607473348824698880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I fibbed a little in my headline. The flamethrower wasn't a gift from Santa Claus. It was a Christmas gift from her staff. I now need to know about the brainstorming session, and what gifts were rejected in favor of a flamethrower. </p><blockquote>Staffer #1: Let's get her one of those giant blankets.<br /><br />Staffer #2: Let's get her a gift card to Applebee's.<br /><br />Staffer #C: Let's get her a flamethrower.<br /><br />Staffers #1 and #2: ...wait, can we do that?<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>It's quieted down somewhat, but Noem is one of the names mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. She was the first to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kristi-noem-unprecedented-attacks" target="_blank">take a stand against the government SCHMOVID mandates</a>, even before Ron DeSantis. She was also an early critic of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kristi-noem-media-pipeline" target="_blank">Biden's energy-dependence-killing executive orders</a>. Though she did waiver when it came to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tucker-carlson-kristi-noem-fox-news-interview-transgender-sports-ncaa-2021-3" target="_blank">protecting women's sports</a>. She's <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-signs-transgender-athlete-ban" target="_blank">since corrected herself</a>, but it's still something to be hashed out during the debates.</p><p>Now she also has a flamethrower. If she does decide to run for president and doesn't set anything on fire during her announcement, it will bring much disappointment. </p><p><p>

## Incoming congressman admits to lying about everything about himself other than one key detail

Incoming GOP Congressman George Santos -- mind you, this was his SECOND time running for office -- was accused of lying about *waves hands* all of it. The first ever gay Republican congressman who went to a great school and worked for the best companies... was married to a woman at one point, and there was no record of his employment or education.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/george-santos-scandal" target="_blank">His lawyers called it a smear job</a>, though they didn't deny any of it. There is a reason for that. George Santos <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/rep-elect-george-santos-admits-fabricating-key-details-of-his-bio/" target="_blank">tells the New York Post</a> it's all true about none of it being true. During the campaign, we were told this grandson of Holocaust survivors worked for Goldman Sachs and Citicorp after graduating from Bausch College. Except...</p><blockquote>I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume. I own up to that. We do stupid things in life.</blockquote><p>He didn't work for either Goldman Sachs or Citigroup either. But there is a reasonable explanation for that. He worked for a company called Link Bridge that worked with those companies. Easy mistake.</p><blockquote>I will be clearer about that. It was stated poorly.</blockquote><p>As for the Holocaust-surviving grandparents, Santos is Catholic. He never said he was Jewish. He said he was "Jew-ish." His words, not mine.</p><blockquote>I never claimed to be Jewish I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was `Jew-ish."</blockquote><p>Rest assured though, Santos is "very much gay." And while he has dated women before, marrying one was a toxic mistake.</p><blockquote>People change. I’m one of those people who change.</blockquote><p>Santos also admitted to being a deadbeat tenant, and he lied about thirteen business properties he owns by...thirteen business properties. He owns none.</p><p>While House Republicans are said to have known about the lies and tall tales and that they became a running joke among leadership,  Nassau County Republican Committee Chairman Joseph Cairo was caught off guard.</p><blockquote>While I have indicated that the congressman-elect deserves a reasonable amount of time to respond to the media, voters deserve a sincere accounting from Mr. Santos. I will be listening attentively, and I want to hear meaningful remarks from George Santos.</blockquote><p>Voters got an accounting, though I'm not sure if I would use the word "sincere." What happens from here, or when Santos shows up to be sworn in next week, is anyone's guess.</p><p><p>

## Watch: World's dumbest criminal livestreams herself looting during a deadly snowstorm

But thanks to Democrat control of New York, stealing has become a spectator sport. This includes a last-minute candidate for 2022's Dumbest Criminal in America award. </p><p>To set the stage, Buffalo (Go Bills) has been hit with the worst blizzard in decades. Twenty-seven people as of this writing have died. Among those still living are these people.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🚨<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a>: Looting breaks out after a major blizzard hits <br /><br />📌<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Buffalo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Buffalo</a> l <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NY</a> <br /><br />Watch as video shows dozens of people looting stores and shops after a major blizzard hit parts of Buffalo causing people to be stranded with no supplies people can be seen walking out with items <a href="https://t.co/tE0D9ssSFO">pic.twitter.com/tE0D9ssSFO</a><br />— R A W S A L E R T S (@rawsalerts) <a href="https://twitter.com/rawsalerts/status/1607200219623481347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Okay, "causing people to be caught without supplies" is bullplop. It's not like the blizzard caught people off guard. Like, they woke up in the morning and there was eleventy feet of snow on the ground. Downstate, a weatherman saying the word "snow" causes a run on bread and milk. People weren't looting because they needed supplies. They were looting because they knew they could get away with it.</p><p>One of them was this specimen, who livestreamed herself committing larceny.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🚨<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UPDATE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UPDATE</a>: More footage taken inside a store shows items scattered everywhere as as people trash the shelves a women can be seen live streaming her self on a Facebook live <a href="https://t.co/o45c6VY9pW">pic.twitter.com/o45c6VY9pW</a><br />— R A W S A L E R T S (@rawsalerts) <a href="https://twitter.com/rawsalerts/status/1607202677544439810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>...of a Family Dollar discount store.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Call me closed-minded, but it's not comparable to Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his daughter when you are chugging soda for social media fame.</p><p>Also, I have to ask...does she not think the police know how to use the internet? This is a pretty clear shot.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9a5e1" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32397026&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Police have more pressing concerns at this moment. But once it stops snowing and the streets get plowed, there needs to be a knock on this woman's door purely on principle. It's New York, so at worst she'll be released on her own recognizance without bail. It would be nice to pretend law and order are still things. Livestreaming yourself committing crimes and thinking it's a hoot proves there are people who don't think so.</p><p><p>

## Democrat Congressman gets fact-checked so hard over the 'Twitter Files' he deletes the tweet in shame and embarrassment

In the olden days, the pre-Elon Musk times, Democrats can get away with it. As Rep.
