Quality shot. </p><p><strong>92nd over: Australia 389-3 (Head 49, Carey 11)</strong> Nortje to start, as was the case yesterday, and he picks up where he left off after Carey nudges a loosener for one run. Nasty bouncer over Head’s back shoulder, squaring him up and making him duck. Head gets off strike, Carey plays off the back foot, eventually picking up a run Warner style by dropping it down into the leg side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/dec/28/australia-v-south-africa-second-test-day-three-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM has a track record for being out of touch, but people with failed enterprises do end up homeless – and the problem may well get worse</p><p>When Rishi Sunak asked Dean, a homeless man at a shelter, whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/24/rishi-sunak-rebuked-over-excruciating-exchange-with-homeless-man">he was in business</a> and wanted to get into the finance industry, many liberals were quick to ridicule him. Angela Rayner gleefully posted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVHJXdcN7R0">video</a>, calling it “excruciating”.

My younger self would have been stunned by the prospect of his favourite pastime being turned into work – perhaps all those years he spent watching Neighbours after school and Eastenders in the evening were finally paying off.

## From Enola Holmes on Netflix to Britain’s union leaders, why feminism for the 99% is thriving | Jo Littler

<p>Instead of ‘leaning in’ and climbing the corporate ladder, a new generation is taking aim at economic and gender inequality</p><p>“Enola Holmes strikes again!” exclaims the trailer for Millie Bobby Brown’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/27/enola-holmes-2-review-netflix-sequel">new Netflix film</a> about Sherlock Holmes’s younger sister – a peppy Victorian sleuth with attitude, who makes continual Fleabag-style asides to camera. “Strikes again!” refers not only to its status as a sequel, but to its setting. The film takes place during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/17/blue-plaque-to-honour-1888-strike-by-1400-east-end-matchgirls">1888 matchgirls’ strike</a>, when more than a thousand women and girls walked out of the Bryant &amp; May factory in east London in protest against toxic working conditions – 14-hour days, poverty wages and the disease of “phossy jaw”, caused by managerial indifference to health and safety. In one scene, strike leader Sarah Chapman stands on a table, shouting: “It’s time for us to refuse to work. It’s time to tell them – NO!”</p><p>It is still both unexpected and heartening to see striking women on screen (unless, of course, you are the Telegraph’s film critic, who gave this otherwise well-reviewed film a paltry 2/5 stars). The film’s representation of women protesting against material conditions is also a sign of the times. After several decades of being pushed aside, marginalised and positioned as unfashionable or even embarrassing, this form of feminism, which tackles gendered and economic exploitation at the same time, is resurgent. Forthright female general secretaries are steering the action of several unions, including Christina McAnea at Unison, Jo Grady at UCU and Sharon Graham of Unite. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/02/strikes-lead-women-frances-ogrady-tuc-unions">Frances O’Grady</a>, outgoing leader of the TUC, puts it, this winter’s wave of strike action is being powered by “a generation of women who are saying ‘enough is enough’”. There is renewed anger at gendered pay gaps and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/29/march-of-the-mummies-protest-pregnant-then-screwed-childcare-costs">marches in the street for affordable childcare</a>.

<p>On a continent that has long attracted western expeditions, a wave of young people are now exploring sites </p><p>A late morning in Khartoum. Inside a low, dusty building in the centre of the Sudanese capital, there are crates of artefacts, a 7ft replica of a 2,000-year-old stone statue of a Nubian god, and students rushing through the corridors. Outside is noisy traffic, blinding sunlight and both branches of the Nile.</p><p>Heading down one staircase are Sabrine Jamal, Nadia Musa, Athar Bela and Sabrine al-Sadiq, all studying archaeology at Khartoum University. Not one of them is older than 24 and they see themselves as pioneers, breaking new ground on a continent that has long attracted western expeditions, specialists and adventurers but whose own archaeologists have received less attention overseas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/27/young-sudanese-archaeologists-dig-up-history-as-west-knows-best-era-ends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bafta-winning writer, director and composer – who can count Quentin Tarantino and Warren Ellis among his fans – discusses exploring the dark side of Cornwall in his latest film, Enys Men</p><p>On a wind-lashed afternoon a few miles from Land’s End, I spot Boswens to the west of the wild, bumpy track. She is a standing stone, more than 2.2m (7ft) tall, situated alone on hard bumps of grass: some think there is a Neolithic tomb beneath her. From different angles, she looks like a trig point on the top of a mountain, the head of an axe or – most peculiarly – a person in profile.</p><p>Boswens’s looming presence is central to Enys Men (pronounced Ennis Mayne, meaning “stone island” in Cornish), the eagerly awaited film by Cornish writer, director and composer Mark Jenkin.<strong> </strong>His previous feature, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/09/bait-review-mark-jenkin-hypnotic-take-on-tourists-ruining-cornwall-fishermen">Bait</a>, was an edgy, 16mm black-and-white film about the tensions between Cornish villagers and tourists. Despite Jenkin having worked in film for more than 20 years, Bait saw him crowned as an overnight arthouse success, winning him the 2020 Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. It was his first film to get major distribution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/27/mark-jenkin-interview-enys-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My boyfriend got a jumper, and I got a load of products to clean the house. Fortunately, as the child of divorced parents, I was used to awkward situations</p><p>It was the first time I had met Judy. She was a friend of my then in-laws, and by “friend”, I mean she cleaned their house, so probably knew more about their relationship than they did. Judy was in her 60s, divorced and lived alone in a flat on an estate around the corner from their redbrick cottage. She had two sons but, as a child of divorced parents myself, I knew not to ask where they were.</p><p>It was Christmas Eve, and one of my first away from home. As a child, I had split all the key holidays between parents, but I always preferred being with my mother. My parents had divorced partly (I think) because my mother was a hopeless wife. My father wanted someone to pour the drinks and skewer the sausages at parties, then wash up at the end. My mother wanted to put up shelves and take down walls with a sledgehammer. Towards the end of her life, she had learned to drive a lorry. I still wonder why they got married.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/27/i-opened-the-wrapping-paper-to-reveal-a-yellow-cleaning-caddy-and-an-apron-the-christmas-present-ill-never-forget">Continue reading...</a>

## My burning shame: I fitted my house with three wood-burning stoves | George Monbiot

<p>Wood burners are incredibly bad for the environment – and flood our homes with toxins, too. I wish I’d known that in 2008</p><p>It’s shame that has stopped me writing about it before. The shame of failing to think for myself and see the bigger picture, which is more or less my job description. Instead, I followed the crowd.</p><p>In 2008 I was refitting my house. It was a century old and poorly built. Insulating it and installing efficient appliances was expensive but straightforward, and the decisions I made were generally good ones. But the toughest issue was heating. The technology that had seemed to show most promise a few years before – <a href="https://www.boilerguide.co.uk/articles/hydrogen-fuel-cells-explained">domestic fuel cells</a> – hadn’t materialised. Domestic heat pumps (which are now more accessible) were extremely expensive and scarcely deployed in the UK. That left only two options: gas or wood. I wanted to unhook myself from fossil fuels. So I went with wood.</p><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s beguiling works have titles like Tie the Temptress to the Trojan and Alabaster for Infidels. So what if they don’t connect with what she paints – she’s hardly art’s first blabbermouth …</p><p>Two girls are playing on the beach. One is dipping her foot into a black pool of water left by an ebbing grey sea. Both are turned away from us, absorbed, as so many of ’s subjects are, in thoughts to which viewers are not privy. I can’t help but project what I know of Yiadom-Boakye on to the picture, not least that she studied painting in Falmouth, so, this chilly study in greys, blacks and browns, is probably inspired by Cornish beaches.</p><p>I look to the title for guidance: Condor and the Mole. What can that mean? Perhaps the toe-dipper is the condor – she’s flinging her arms out balletically as if she were a broad-winged bird poised to take flight and her friend – is what? – an earthbound mole? But surely she isn’t a mole – there’s nothing subterranean about her at all; in her orange skirt and white top, she’s the light that disrupts the darkling colour scheme. Or perhaps I’ve got this all wrong: maybe the mole is the pool of water, rising to the surface, touching the condor girl’s toe as God’s finger touched Adam’s in Michelangelo’s famed work. And that leads me on to madder thoughts: maybe condor girl has struck oil in Cornwall and Jeremy Hunt needn’t worry about reducing the government debt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/27/paintings-baffling-titles-lynette-yiadom-boakye">Continue reading...</a>

Jarvis Masters calls me collect from death row, when he can get the phone – I’ve never seen quite how this works, but the prison guards haul some kind of apparatus to the small cage in which he’s been confined for the past 30-something years and he dials out. I keep a fund topped up for these calls. The calls, which a voice reminds us may be monitored, are automatically terminated after 15 minutes. If they don’t take the phone away for someone else to use, he can call back.</p><p>We laugh and joke a lot and talk about everything under the sun, but not much about daily life on death row in San Quentin state prison. That’s usually not what he wants to talk about, although, during a recent in-person visit, he told a very funny story about Charles Manson from when Manson had the cell next to him. To live for 41 years in a small cage in a concrete structure is to be profoundly sensorily deprived, and that’s made him eager for secondhand evidence of the outside world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/27/us-prisons-death-row-rebecca-solnit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The federal right to abortion ended in 2022 – where does that leave people seeking to terminate a pregnancy going forward?</p><p>It was a landmark year for abortion rights, for all the wrong reasons. In the summer, the US supreme court, with its new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/oct/02/us-supreme-court-cases-monumental-impact-democracy">hard-right supermajority</a>, dismantled the constitutional right to abortion secured almost 50 years ago through Roe v Wade. After that came a slew of laws passed in state legislatures, court battles and – indeed – some surprise victories for abortion rights advocates.

<p>Crushingly tedious fantasy action, a strange Keeley Hawes thriller and a snoozy Sally Rooney adaptation … it’s the televisual disappointments of the year</p><p>Oof, this $300m Netflix deal is not going well. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ryan-murphy">Ryan Murphy</a> – once renowned as the very Midas of soapy, campy television – has had a stock market crash this year on a par with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/19/netflix-slump-earnings-call-second-quarter-2022">streaming giant’s own plummet</a>. (Who’s working on the Venn diagram?) Murphy would once make hit after hit that hooked us without fail. This year, his output has gone from the outright tedious to the truly sickening. The worst offender was Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which despite being grisly, nauseating and fetishistic about a serial killer who ate some of his victims, rode high in the Netflix charts for weeks on end. The other Murphian show that nearly made the cut here was The Watcher, which starred Jennifer Coolidge but was ultimately a duff thriller about a typewriter. Let’s hope Murphy’s next series of Feud – in which Truman Capote makes delicious rifts in New York high society – makes up for all this awfulness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/27/the-rings-of-power-to-conversations-with-friends-2022s-tv-letdowns">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for baked chicken and potatoes with lemon and rosemary | A kitchen in Rome

<p>Not the super-crisp variety of roast potatoes, but irresistibly sticky ones infused with chicken juices, lemon and garlic, all baked in the one tray</p><p>In summer, its hardest season, the fridge in the butcher’s shop below our flat hums. It isn’t a constant hum, or even a consistent one. Mostly, it sounds like a tired bee trapped against glass in another room. But then, every so often, it gets louder, turning first into a cross wasp, then an old tube train, before dropping off so suddenly, it sounds as if it has been turned off. It hasn’t, of course, and soon, like a child playing or someone on a cheerful stroll, it is humming again.</p><p>This fridge has caused controversy in our building, being responsible for sleepless nights and a divorce. As someone who sleeps through almost everything, I know the level of hum only because it has kept me company reading or scrolling on my phone. The issue goes away in winter, when the fridge, with less to do, is turned down, meaning the hum is more of a vibration through the tiles. Which are also warm. A shop, and a fridge, that provides us with inadvertent underfloor heating, as well as the chicken thighs for this week’s recipe, which are also ideal for a party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/27/baked-chicken-and-potatoes-with-lemon-and-rosemary-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

## Festive re-reads: Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton

<p>Our series continues as Rosalind Jana suggests this ‘Wuthering Heights in miniature’ as a perfect seasonal read</p><p>Ethan Frome is not your typical festive book. There are no fabulous parties or thawed hearts, no warming morals about the power of togetherness realised with a fireplace crackling somewhere in the background. In fact, Edith Wharton’s 1911 novella is a melancholy, mean little story, as chilly in tone as the lonely Massachusetts landscape with its “sheet of snow perpetually renewed from … pale skies”. And yet, there’s something in it that makes it a perfect read for those slushy days between Christmas and new year. Perhaps it’s the length: short enough to be consumed in one or two sittings, gulped down like ice water. Perhaps it’s the growing sense of foreboding, ideal for those who prefer their December reading to be of the truly bleak midwinter variety (or anyone in need of a palate cleanser after all that yuletide indulgence).</p><p>Mostly, though, it’s because of the seasonal setting. In the remote New England village of Starkfield, winter’s beautiful torpor rules everything. It shapes moods, hastens life-altering decisions, and provides the perfect stage for a tragedy that couldn’t happen at any other time of the year. Its “torrents of light and air” by day and “silver-edged darkness” by night cast a penetrating spotlight over the area, rendering the actions of its inhabitants as crystalline as the flakes that continually coat the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/27/festive-re-reads-ethan-frome-by-edith-wharton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A sharing platter of smoked fish with quick homemade pickles, horseradish cream cheese with crisp fried capers and poshed-up baked potatoes</p><p>The idea here is you make a big batch of the pickles for everyone to dive into, to accompany a platter of assorted smoked fish, and baked potatoes poshed-up with horseradish and dill labneh and a pop of salty fish roe, which adds a lovely sparkle. I use lumpfish or trout roe to dress them up along with chopped chives, but if you’re not a fan of fish eggs, just leave them out. Smoked salmon is super-expensive these days, so I buy just one packet and mix it up with smoked mackerel, haddock and a tin of something delicious such as smoked oysters, which are a treat for less than £3.</p><p>The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

The bewitching video sent people wild and has since had more than <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/negroni-sbagliato-prosecco?lang=en" title="">100m views on TikTok</a>. “I’m thrilled that drink is finally getting the recognition it deserves,” they say in those now-famous velvety tones. “And my mum is thrilled about me becoming a meme! It’s very flattering.”</p><p>It happened while doing publicity for House of the Dragon – HBO’s highly anticipated prequel to Game of Thrones, based on George RR Martin’s book Fire and Blood. D’Arcy plays Rhaenyra Targaryen, who is named heir to the iron throne but is constantly challenged by those who do not believe a woman should sit upon it. As the death of King Viserys, her declining father (played by Paddy Considine) draws closer, the chambers and corridors of the Red Keep are thick with plotting and backstabbing – everything Game of Thrones fans had been missing since 2019.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/27/hot-glue-gunning-hair-head-emma-darcy-house-of-the-dragon-audition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blondness is back. Post pandemic, tweed blond, ice cube blond and rose gold blonds have been everywhere from celebrities and influencers to schoolkids and footballers.

## My partner and I are both grieving. Sex might help us cope – but he has lost interest

<p>We have had seven happy, loving years together. But I’m feeling the need for physical comfort</p><p><strong>My partner and I have been</strong><strong> in a loving and happy relationship for seven years.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>During the</strong><strong> past two years three of our parents have either died or been diagnosed with a terminal</strong><strong> illness</strong><strong>. We remain close but</strong><strong> physical contact has become less frequent and meaningful. I find sex a cathartic way to deal with the stresses we have faced, and a way to demonstrate our closeness, but he has </strong><strong>understandably</strong><strong> become</strong><strong> reluctant to be intimate. I feel our need for sex has a different purpose and miss our shared understanding of what</strong><strong> closeness means for us.</strong></p><p>Grief certainly can negatively affect a person’s sexual response and many people find that recovery can take quite some time. Occasionally, bereavement develops into depression, which in itself can shut down sexual interest or functioning. It is unfortunate that you and your partner are having different sexual reactions as you work through loss and try to heal, but recognise that you are simply experiencing different sexual responses to grief and, if possible, share those feelings with each other to feel more heard. Grief counselling could be very helpful. Your bereavement is relatively new, but if healing does not appear to be progressing it will be essential to seek help. At any point in a relationship it is extremely common for sex to hold different meanings for each partner. Take heart – it is reasonable to maintain hope that there will eventually be healing and a resolution of your current sexual issues.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

## France review – TV presenter Léa Seydoux is mesmeric in intriguing media satire

<p>The star and the film’s intentional blankness add a layer of interest to Bruno Dumont’s loose reverie about a journalist experiencing an emotional breakdown</p><p>Whatever its flaws, this movie provides fans of French star Léa Seydoux with a treat. She is in closeup so much of the time: that mesmeric, feline beauty is cool in repose, a mask of indifference or mystery, but with a suggestion of late night indulgence in the faint lines under the eyes. She has something of Isabelle Huppert’s hauteur – although Huppert’s own faintly ironised blankness only came at a later life-stage. Seydoux’s hairstyling and maquillage are swoonworthy, particularly the arterial slash of lipstick. She never appears without a different, entirely gorgeous designer outfit (mostly Louis Vuitton), sensational enough to shatter glass.</p><p>As for the film itself, it’s an oddity which never quite finds its purpose or shape. Partly it is a TV news/celebrity satire in the style of Network or Broadcast News; partly a state-of-the-nation parable (this may just come down to her character being called “France” and people saying things like “I love you, France!”); and partly a tragicomic reverie about what women want, and what men want.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/27/france-review-tv-presenter-lea-seydoux-is-mesmeric-in-intriguing-media-satire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Adjoa, 59, met Cunnell, 58, when he was running a bookshop in the 1990s. They live together in London</p><p>Actor Adjoa Andoh first recalls meeting the author Howard Cunnell at the Battersea Arts Centre’s bookshop in 1994. “I had a theatre company called Wild Iris,” she says. “We had a tiny little office at the centre. One of our directors came in one day to say someone was taking over the bookstore downstairs, and that he was tasty.” She and her colleagues rushed to see if they could spot him. “We went in and there was Howard. He was this very smiley man behind the till in a patch of sunshine.”</p><p>She wasn’t aware that Howard had already caught a glimpse of her before, when he was moving into the shop. “There was a lovely staircase that went up to the offices. I’d seen Adjoa come down those stairs and I lost my head,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/27/how-adjoa-andoh-met-howard-cunnell-i-saw-her-coming-down-the-stairs-and-i-lost-my-head">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The leader’s unprecedented third term opens with Covid protests, economic and housing issues and Taiwan strait crisis</p><p>As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda.</p><p>But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/27/china-xi-third-term-covid-protests-economy-taiwan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A cobalt sky, bush-covered headlands and swivelling stingray eyes: in the stillness of dawn, it’s just me and the ocean</p><p>The sea curls around my ankles as I take a bearing on one of the yellow buoys that define the “no-boat zone” at Balmoral beach. I wade in, lean forward and let the water catch my fall. I start freestyling towards the cone, the taste of salt puckering my tongue. It’s 6.45am and the sun has been up a while.</p><p>Balmoral shimmers under a cobalt sky. The sea is glassy, the temperature in the low 20s. En route to the cone, I pass over clumps of seaweed deposited by a recent storm and a small stingray etched on the bottom; the ray doesn’t move, but I sense its eyes tracking me like swivels on an antenna base. Every few strokes I look sideways and ahead, as much to avoid contact with oncoming lap swimmers as to be aware of semi-submerged figures in straw hats and sunglasses, and bent-arm backstrokers ploughing through the water like combine harvesters. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/27/a-solitary-morning-ocean-swim-is-a-salty-sanctuary-for-introverts-like-me">Continue reading...</a>
