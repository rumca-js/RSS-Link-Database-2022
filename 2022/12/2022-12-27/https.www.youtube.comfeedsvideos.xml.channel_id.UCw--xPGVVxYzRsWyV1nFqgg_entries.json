Join me while we walk through a break down of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings just like we have for Malazan, The Wheel of Time, First Law, and so many more. \n\nWhich adaptation discussed was your favorite? I mean, we all know it's peter jackson's lord of the rings trilogy, but aside from that masterpiece, which do you like the most? Have you read the books? It's surprising to me how many haven't. Big thank you again to  @NerdoftheRings  for reviewing the video!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9XlI1BNKI", "date_published": "2022-12-27 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
