Some people probably, but I\u2019m gonna do them anyway. What does ol Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and the rest of the industry have to offer in the year of 2023? I don\u2019t really know, I\u2019m just guessing. That\u2019s the fun of it! \n\nAs I say in the video, I don\u2019t want to go too \u201cin-depth\u201d with all this, because many of these events would justify a video in their own right, but it does give me a chance to talk about a bunch of things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise mention.\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1-4ujuIKqg", "date_published": "2022-12-27 21:30:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
