<p>A new year kicks off in just a few days, but there's still time to wrap up some 2022 resolutions in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraph-trailer-focuses-on-rasputin-and-xivu-arath/1100-6509741/">Season of the Seraph</a> continues into its fourth week of action.</p><p>To get the Exo frame modules this week, you'll want to focus on the seasonal quest and boot up a round of Heist Battlegrounds. For More Than A Weapon's secondary challenge, you can easily grind through Scorn and Hive on Savathun's Throneworld, with the Extraction Lost Sector in the Quagmire being a good area to farm.</p><p>In Heist Battlegrounds III, the focus here is on breaching a submind vault without alerting Wrathborn reinforcements, which means you'll need to quickly grab the tools you need in this section to get past the Hive glyphs and open the doors. Not too difficult at all, if you've been playing regularly and know what to expect from this little platforming section.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraph-seasonal-challenges-guide-week-4/1100-6509714/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Best Of 2022: Grounded's Cute Aesthetic Masks One Of The Year's Scariest Games

<p>When we think about the best horror games, or even just the most popular, a certain aesthetic comes to mind: dark, grimy corridors; wet, organic, but indescribable objects; monsters that were once human but are no longer anything close. Dead Space, Outlast, Amnesia, Scorn, Resident Evil, Silent Hill. Almost as far back as horror games go, so does that aesthetic. It's so common as to be predictable, but one of the most powerful aspects of horror is its ability to surprise. Obsidian's survival game Grounded, then, definitely qualifies as horror despite being absolutely adorable. <em><strong>Warning: </strong>There's a picture of a spider further into this piece.</em>Â </p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4057145-everybody.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4057145-everybody.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Indeed, Grounded doesn't look a whole lot like the type of games we think of as horror. They often mimic movies like The Thing, Alien, and Jacob's Ladder. Grounded, in both pitch and aesthetic, is much closer to Honey I Shrunk The Kids, a sci-fi romp about kids who are accidentally shrunk by their father's newly-invented shrinking ray and have to survive giant ants and the like and get back to normal size. That's exactly what Grounded is about; you play one of four young teens trying to survive in a backyard while also looking for a way to return to your normal size. You can make houses out of grass, axes and hammers out of pebbles, and there are weevils and aphids all over that make for a good dinner. Water droplets hang from blades of grass, and ladybugs wander around making the cutest sounds you can imagine.</p><p dir="ltr">But all of that belies a terrifying world. Your first encounter with the true nature of the backyard may not be the same as mine. You might encounter a stinkbug, a soldier ant, or maybe you accidentally whack a ladybug, turning it from a neutral beast into an angry murder dome. Or maybe you see the blades of grass rustling ahead of you and then hear the telltale slurping sounds of a wolf spider just out of view. It won't remain out of view for long, though, as these things are the size of a motor home relative to your character. The second it sees you, it'll do two things: scream and charge.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/groundeds-cute-aesthetic-masks-one-of-2022s-scariest-games/1100-6510112/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3: Everything We Know About The Final Installment Of James Gunn's Trilogy

<p><h2>Everything We Know About Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074670-guardans-3-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Guardians of the Galaxy was a massive test. Not just for the MCU, but for its director, James Gunn. All Marvel Studios films previous to Guardians had featured a major member of the Avengers, or the Avengers name itself. While they weren't Spider-Man or Batman, Captain America and Iron Man at least lived in the cultural consciousness. The Guardians of the Galaxy did not. James Gunn, meanwhile, had directed a small handful of gory movies, including the dark superhero comedy, Super.</p><p dir="ltr">Killer casting, a soundtrack filled with unequaled needledrops, and MCU-grade visual effects skyrocketed the Guardians and Gunn from unknown to household names almost literally overnight, making stars of both of them. These days, Gunn is taking the reins over at the DC Studios arm of Warner Bros. Discovery, and the Guardians have a brand-new (James Gunn-directed) holiday special. Gunn directed a film and a television series for DC, and the Guardians of the Galaxy characters have appeared in multiple Avengers films and the latest Thor movie, Thor: Love &amp; Thunder and even have their own holiday special.</p><p>Now, though, it's time for both Gunn and the current Guardians lineup to close out their time with Marvel together, at least for now. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is nearly here after a very long wait--thanks in part to some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gun-returns-to-direct-guardians-of-the-galax/1100-6465607/">ill-advised employment decisions by Disney</a>--and is hitting theaters in 2023 to pick up where that golden cliffhanger at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 left us nearly six years ago.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>What's the release date for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074671-guardians-3-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 releases exactly six years after Vol. 2. That movie hit theaters on May 5, 2017. Guardians Vol. 3 is currently set to release on <strong>May 5, 2023</strong>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Who's the director?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074672-guardians-3-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">James Gunn, who directed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, as well as the holiday special and two different Guardians-centric theme park rides, is directing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. While this was assumed to be the case after the success of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, that changed in 2018 when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3s-james-gunn-fired-by-dis/1100-6460589/">Disney fired Gunn</a> over some old tweets for which he'd already apologized. For a time, the film was moving forward with another director at the helm, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-to-use-fired-director-ja/1100-6464883/">using Gunn's script</a>. The cast came out in support of him, but things were looking bleak for a while, right up until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gun-returns-to-direct-guardians-of-the-galax/1100-6465607/">Disney re-hired him</a>. But that wasn't before Warner Bros. offered him him the chance to direct a DC Comics movie, which ended up being The Suicide Squad. That subsequently spawned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/peacemaker-review-james-gunns-the-suicide-squad-spin-off-takes-no-prisoners-on-hbo-max/1900-6417808/">well-received</a> ten-episode series about John Cena's character, Peacemaker, which has been renewed for a second season. Disney and Gunn pushed that date out yet further with the aforementioned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-returns-to-write-and-direct-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-for-disney/1100-6485416/">Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</a>, which has Drax and Mantis looking for the ultimate Christmas gift for Peter Quill. Gunn not only directed every one of the above Marvel and DC projects, he wrote all of them as well, though sometimes with a co-writer.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Which cast members are returning?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074673-guardians-3-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The whole core cast of the Guardians films is returning. That includes Chris Pratt as Star-Lord/Peter Quill, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as the voices of Rocket the Racoon and Groot. Other returning members include James' brother Sean Gunn as Kraglin, Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, and Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Which cast members are new?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074674-guardians-3-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Most prominent among new cast members is Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. Poulter is previously best known for his roles in The Maze Runner and We're The Millers. Actors from previous Gunn projects will show up as well. Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) and Chukwudi Iwuji (Peacemaker) have joined the cast, as has Maria Bakalova, who debuted as the voice of Cosmo the Spacedog, a psychic dog from the Russian space program, in the Holiday Special.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074675-guardians-3-6.jpg" /></p><br />     <p><h2>What do we know about the story?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074678-guardians-3-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Details on the plot are light, but the Guardians have been trying to make Knowhere, a prominent location from the first two films, into a safe haven for victims of the Snap (or Blip, if you're writing a Marvel script). Now, they find their home and the universe threatened by a new enemy. Adam Warlock was teased at the end of Guardians Vol. 2. In Marvel comics, he's a heroic character and a supposedly perfect being created by Earth scientists who rebels against his creators. He is sought out by a being called the High Evolutionary, who asks him to save a planet called Counter-Earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Warlock figures heavily into the Infinity War saga in the comics, as one of the very few beings that can safely wield the Infinity Gauntlet. After his tease in Guardians Vol. 2, it was assumed by many fans that he would figure into the Infinity Saga finale as well, though that never came to be. The Infinity gems are out of the picture, but Warlock has lots of other stories to tell. The 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy video game pitted the Guardians against the Universal Church of Truth, led in the comics by a corrupted version of Warlock. Additionally, new cast member Chukwudi Iwuji is playing the aforementioned High Evolutionary, who also figures into Rocket Raccoon's origin story. Additionally, the planet the Guardians land on in the movie's first full trailer appears to be the Counter-Earth from the comics, an Earth-like planet populated by humanoid animals.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Is there a trailer?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074679-guardians-3-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">There sure is! A full trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 debuted on December 1, 2022, and you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3V5KDHRQvk">here</a>. The trailer sets up the tone of the film, which will act as the finale for these characters' time in the MCU.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Will there be more movies?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4074680-guardians-3-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">James Gunn has explicitly said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-will-be-last-for-james-gunn/1100-6500058/">this film will be his last</a> Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and cast members <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/12/zoe-saldana-stuck-in-mcu-franchise-1234787020/">like Zoe Saldana</a> have expressed frustration at spending so much time in franchise roles (she's currently starring in Avatar: The Way of Water). The Guardians, however, are a canonically malleable team, meaning that if Marvel Studios wanted to introduce a new Guardians of the Galaxy team, they could--but that seems unlikely.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

## Silent Hill Ascension Release Date, Trailers, And Everything We Know So Far

<p dir="ltr">Of all the Silent Hill projects currently in development--and there are a lot, as we'll detail further down in this article--the one that is hardest to figure out is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-ascension/">Silent Hill Ascension</a>. With only a reveal trailer to go off of, even fans paying close attention likely have several questions about what kind of game it's going to be. This answer, and others, are a bit hazy as of now, but not without some context clues. Here's everything we know so far about Silent Hill Ascension.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Silent Hill Ascension release date</h2><p dir="ltr">When the experience was revealed, it didn't come with a specific release date, but it was announced for 2023. However, as we'll explain, it may not have just a single release date anyway.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Silent Hill Ascension?</h2><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill Ascension is not a traditional video game, though it is an interactive experience. It may not even launch on consoles and PC, though it may be viewable on those platforms one way or another. These are questions we don't yet have answers to. What we do know is that Ascension is a MILE, or massively interactive live event. MILEs are transmedia interactive experiences that, historically, have come from a number of different teams, but all operate on the foundational cloud technology from Genvid Technologies.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-ascension-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510159/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
