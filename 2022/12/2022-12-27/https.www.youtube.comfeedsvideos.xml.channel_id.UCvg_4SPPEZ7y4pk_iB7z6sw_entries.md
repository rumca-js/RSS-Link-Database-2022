Who doesn’t like predictions? Some people probably, but I’m gonna do them anyway. What does ol Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and the rest of the industry have to offer in the year of 2023? I don’t really know, I’m just guessing. That’s the fun of it! 

As I say in the video, I don’t want to go too “in-depth” with all this, because many of these events would justify a video in their own right, but it does give me a chance to talk about a bunch of things I wouldn’t otherwise mention.
