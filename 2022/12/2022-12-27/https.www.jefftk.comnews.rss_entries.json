I realized yesterday, though, that\nthere's an easy work-around: zooming.  By pinch-zooming I can make the\nseek bar almost the whole width of my phone, which is a big\nimprovement:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/zoomed-in-seek-bar-chrome-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"1076\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/zoomed-in-seek-bar-chrome.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's not perfect: it's not super discoverable and it still doesn't\nmake great use of the available vertical space (showing timing and\nseeking at the same time would be nice) but I'm very happy I've found\nthis.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02F7btAwbXS7j21vfCA6wcFf9wQUPvCsUmzPUrzPJmuWYVeVjXuS8pjKwfoSnjpGJKl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/EaK8CgRTPHXLT7ypi\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109588924533618036\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/zooming-the-chrome-audio-player", "date_published": "2022-12-27 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
