<p>On Tuesday, workers at Proletariat, the Boston-based studio Blizzard <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-spellbreak-proletariat-153150750.html"><ins>bought earlier this year</ins></a> to support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-announced-182442860.html"><em><ins>World of Warcraft</ins></em><ins> development</ins></a>, announced they recently filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Proletariat is the third Activision Blizzard studio to announce a union drive in 2022, but where past campaigns at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-activision-blizzard-union-game-workers-alliance-195516977.html"><ins>Raven Software</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-second-qa-tester-union-vote-results-205949946.html"><ins>Blizzard Albany</ins></a> involved the quality assurance workers at those studios, the effort at Proletariat includes all non-management workers. The 57 workers who want to form the Proletariat Workers Alliance include animators, game designers and software engineers. The group seeks representation from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that helped QA staff at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany organize.</p><p>“Everyone in the video game industry knows Activision Blizzard’s reputation for creating a hostile work environment, so earlier this year, when we heard that Blizzard was planning to acquire Proletariat, we started to discuss how we could protect the great culture we have created here,” said Dustin Yost, a software engineer at Proletariat. “By forming a union and negotiating a contract, we can make sure that we are able to continue doing our best work and create innovative experiences at the frontier of game development.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Proletariat Workers Alliance asked Activision Blizzard to recognize their union voluntarily. According to the group, the company has yet to respond to the request.  Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request.</p><p>The workers at Proletariat say they aim to preserve the studio’s “progressive, human-first” benefits, including its flexible paid time off policy and robust healthcare options. Additionally, they want to protect the studio from crunch, the practice of forcing compulsory overtime during the development of a game. They’re asking management to commit to a no-mandatory overtime policy and implement better pay and health protections for workers who agree to voluntary overtime. The Proletariat Workers Alliance says their colleagues also shouldn’t be penalized during performance reviews for not taking on extra work.</p><p>In June, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-unionization-agreement-cwa-163550095.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> it would respect all unionization efforts at Activision Blizzard following the close of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html"><ins>$68.7 billion deal</ins></a> to buy the publisher. Earlier this month, the FTC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html"><ins>sued</ins></a> the tech giant to block the merger.</p>

<p>It’s been a year and change since the release of the enhanced Nintendo Switch OLED model, with its larger 7-inch screen, longer battery life and some much-needed design tweaks. While it’s not a must-have upgrade from the original, it is the best choice for first-time Switch buyers. But whether you’re a newcomer to the system or upgrading from the five-year old first-gen model, you’ll want to make the most of your $350 investment with a few well-chosen Switch OLED accessories. We’ve outlined our favorites below.</p><h2>SanDisk microSD card</h2><p></p><p>With only 64GB of on-board storage, you’re going to want to get a microSD for your Switch OLED to store downloaded games, save files and screenshots. And with the redesigned slot it’s easier than ever to put it in or take it out of the system, too. You can use pretty much any microSD card with your Nintendo Switch, but the Nintendo-branded ones from SanDisk are solid, and you can get a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYW5EaXNrLU1pY3JvU0RYQy1NZW1vcnktTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwN1FENlI1TDc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxMzY0NTg2LTk0YjYtNDBjNC1iZjc4LTg5Y2Q3NjA0MTNkMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd6KwZ5HHeGtuSJ7cxDBQ54pm9TbsbtHkN9I325d3-oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSanDisk-MicroSDXC-Memory-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07QD6R5L7">256GB model</a> at a pretty affordable rate right now.

Their rubberized nature means they’re easy on your hands and super durable – a must for anyone with rambunctious, electronics-destroying children. But adult gamers will appreciate how much easier they are to hold than a bare Joy-Con, and they slip on and off easily, which makes them easy to clean and transport. Our only regret is that they don’t come in white to match the Joy-Cons that come with the OLED system, but there is a pair of black grips that should still look stylish.</p><h2>PowerA Enhanced Nano controller</h2><p></p><p>When you need a Pro-style controller but don’t have space for a Pro-style controller, PowerA has you covered with its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QT1dFUi1FbmhhbmNlZC1XaXJlbGVzcy1Db250cm9sbGVyLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDhCSzI3S1pGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUovdkDgEkWVHCJOffyKmMpm6lnmBonM-q390HwcJEW0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPOWER-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB08BK27KZF">Enhanced Nano gamepad</a>.

It’s easy enough to tuck away in your bag for a gaming emergency, and it’s affordable, too.</p><h2>SteelSeries Arctis 1</h2><p></p><p>Nintendo pushed out a firmware update that lets you use any Bluetooth headset natively with your Switch, which is fantastic if you already own a wireless gaming headset. But if you don’t have one, or find it a little too bulky, I’m still going to recommend the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg2TTREUTdSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeytyEJQ6Ovw4V7ceCavLWliAQazQQkpUXyrZ1afskEf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB086M4DQ7R">Arctis 1</a> from SteelSeries as a good option for the Switch. It sounds great, is super comfortable and stylish, and the included USB-C dongle is still easier than connecting to the console via Bluetooth. At $100, it’s also reasonably priced for a gaming headset.</p><h2>Razer Barracuda X</h2><p></p><p>Like the Arctis 1, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1CYXJyYWN1ZGEtV2lyZWxlc3MtTXVsdGktUGxhdGZvcm0tSGVhZHNldC9kcC9CMDk2TjZRNTFOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcbeCc2JabIRygBuI8rjyAawv696zhBKHhfGgjcTEryG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset%2Fdp%2FB096N6Q51N">Barracuda X</a> uses a USB-C dongle to connect to your console. Unlike the Arctis, though, it comes in assorted colors like quartz pink and white, the latter of which matches the Switch OLED’s panda-colored Joy-Cons. Aside from that, it’s just as solid as the Arctis 1, with 40mm drivers and a super light but sturdy design that feels and looks great on your noggin.</p><h2>PowerA Joy-Con charging dock</h2><p></p><p>One thing that Switch owners quickly realize is that if they want to play games with friends, they’re going to want some extra Joy-Cons on hand. But the Switch console itself can only charge one set at a time. Why not increase your capacity by adding this charging station to your setup (it plugs right into your Switch dock), with space for <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Db250cm9sbGVyLUNoYXJnaW5nLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC1XaXJlbGVzcy1yZWNoYXJnZWFibGUtZHAtQjBCNVJZVkhYRy9kcC9CMEI1UllWSFhHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZyhePN_DJ2YekxBugDKtPkNp28FM16Dgc0Js8i4q2_X&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FController-Charging-Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-rechargeable-dp-B0B5RYVHXG%2Fdp%2FB0B5RYVHXG">two Joy-Cons and a Pro controller</a>, which means you'll never have to deal with a dead controller again. That’s perfect for games like <em>Towerfall</em>, <em>Party Golf</em>, <em>Super Bomberman R</em> and of course, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>.</p><h2>Turtle Beach Battle Buds</h2><p></p><p>If you’re an on-the-go Switch gamer who’d rather not drag around a full-size headset but still craves high-end audio, know that most accessory makers are releasing earbuds made especially for gaming – though your existing wireless earbuds will still, in many cases, do a bang-up job. If you do want a dedicated pair made especially with gaming in mind, these <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UdXJ0bGUtQmF0dGxlLUdhbWluZy1IZWFkc2V0LU1vYmlsZS1OaW50ZW5kby9kcC9CMDdNTUYyQ0ZOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMTM2NDU4Ni05NGI2LTQwYzQtYmY3OC04OWNkNzYwNDEzZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ1we0_PTAn7NPsQcm-73fm3m9BIT6uXDGG1_mNdg73b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTurtle-Battle-Gaming-Headset-Mobile-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB07MMF2CFN">wired buds from Turtle Beach</a> have sports tips so they’ll stay firmly in your ear while you’re walking or shouting at the competition on the included mic. But you may not have to shout, since that microphone is a detachable model that you can bend toward your mouth, instead of the usual fiddly in-line mic that most wired headphones come with these days.</p><h2>iVoler Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h2><p></p><p>The Switch OLED’s screen is beautiful enough that you’ll definitely want to give it an extra layer of protection. Because it’s slightly larger than the screen on the standard Switch, you’ll need to make sure you get a screen protector that’s specifically made for the OLED model, and I also recommend a tempered glass kitl because it’s more durable than plastic.

## Razzmatazz review: A delightful (and delightfully pink) drum machine

<p>Earlier this year 1010music released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-lemondrop-and-fireball-nanobox-synthesizer-review-130035502.html">Lemondrop and Fireball</a>, two surprisingly full-featured synths in unbelievably tiny packages. The company’s Nanobox lineup covers a lot of ground between those two instruments, but neither was particularly well suited to handling drums. So the company took the same core hardware, put a percussion-focused FM engine in it, along with a sampler, gave the whole thing a playful pink paint job, and dubbed it the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-nanobox-razzmatazz-drum-machine-182806840.html">Razzmatazz</a>.</p><p>The latest member of the 1010music family is a rich sounding drum machine with a simple 64-step sequencer. While it may lack some modern amenities you’d expect from a <a href="https://1010music.com/product/nanobox-razzmatazz">$399</a> instrument, it makes up for it with a robust set of sound design features. And yes, even 10 months later, the Nanoboxes are still shockingly small.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/690c59e0-856d-11ed-afaf-aa27ad5082a5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>I won’t spend too much time rehashing the hardware since I’ve already covered it in my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-lemondrop-and-fireball-nanobox-synthesizer-review-130035502.html">review</a> of the Lemondrop and Fireball, but here’s a quick recap. The whole thing is 3.75 inches wide, 3 inches tall, and 1.5 inches thick – small enough to fit in even the tiniest of bags or a large pocket. There’s a two-inch touchscreen on the front, plus four navigation buttons and a pair of encoders. Around back you get ⅛-inch MIDI in and outs, ⅛-inch audio ins and outs, a USB-C port for power and a microSD slot (pre-populated with a 32GB card) for storing samples and presets.</p><p>The only notable exterior change from the previous Nanobox entries is the color. There’s no functional advantage to the Razzmatazz being hot pink, but I love it. As I mentioned in my review of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cre8audio-east-best-and-west-pest-cheap-modular-synthesis-review-143003424.html">Cre8Audio’s East Beast and West Pest</a>, synths should be <em>fun. </em>I have nothing against the Korgs, Elektrons and Moogs of the world. But their instruments often take themselves quite seriously. And I, for one, think the synth world could use a splash of color now and then.</p><h2>The Sound Engine</h2><figure><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/68f0e2a0-856d-11ed-b979-41bbb7ef86a9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>At the core of the Razzmatazz is an eight-voice engine that combines FM synthesis and sample playback. Each pad can be either or both, which is fairly unique. I can’t think of another affordable hardware drum machine that allows you to combine FM tones and samples in quite the same way. You can simply layer the two, but you could also, for example, use a sample of an actual timpani for the attack, then let the synth fade in after.</p><p>It’s a really fun effect and similar to what you find Roland’s late ‘80s Linear Arithmetic synthesizers like the <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_d-50/">D-50</a>. The only issue is that figuring out how to achieve it isn’t immediately obvious. Since the two envelopes here are simple sustain / decay affairs, you can’t just soften the attack and be done with it. Instead you have to assign the envelope to control the volume of the digital oscillators, but set the mod depth to negative 100 percent, at which point the decay acts like the attack.</p><div id="fda3308bcc384998a1ecd87116716ff9"><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL2VuZ2FkZ2V0LXBvZGNhc3QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMxOTdlMjkzLWI1M2EtNDkzNi05ZmEzLTNiNzI0ZjVkYmVmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAa_qGIbelsIZHvxK5z0oT4CeIIp5ziY1dQi7013EtJih&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</a> · <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL2VuZ2FkZ2V0LXBvZGNhc3QvMTAxMG11c2ljLXJhenptYXRhenotZGVtb3Mvcy1FTk5XMW9XMmFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzE5N2UyOTMtYjUzYS00OTM2LTlmYTMtM2I3MjRmNWRiZWZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbyhG6w7c4IN08QPefSHoQgn03eGRLYm-lt_ExsaaEBN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2F1010music-razzmatazz-demos%2Fs-ENNW1oW2aol" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="1010music Razzmatazz demos">1010music Razzmatazz demos</a></div></div><p>Another key difference is, the Razzmatazz can’t be played chromatically. So you can’t craft a room shaking bassline to accompany your drum pattern. You also can’t pull the trick of using the modulation sequencer to control pitch, like you could on the Lemondrop and Fireball. In fact, there is no modulation sequencer, just two LFOs and two envelopes. And pitch isn’t a modulation destination. You can change the tuning of individual pads and create something melodic that way, but that’s it.</p><p>The sounds themselves are excellent, though. The collection of 120 preset kits tend toward the glitchy and electro side of things. Since there’s a sampler, in addition to the FM engine, however, you can get convincing real drum sounds too. Most of the included samples don’t lean into the acoustic realm, but you can easily load or record your own if you like. The one thing to note is that there’s no way to chop up samples on the Razzmatazz. So if you want to slice up a breakbeat, you need to do that before you import it as separate files. Same for loops.</p><section><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/694236f1-856d-11ed-9fff-66f785b4bb31" /></section><p>The top left-most pad has two special modes called Slicer and Clip. These allow you to get some of the benefits of chops and loops. But they’re a tad cumbersome and require some prep work. Slicer will playback bits and pieces of a sample, but you have to mark cue points using the company’s Blackbox or in software like Reaper or OcenAudio. Of course this is different from chopping up and rearranging a sample. Instead Slicer works its way through a full sample in a particular direction or jumps around randomly.</p><p>Clip mode is primarily for loops, but again, you need to trim up the sample beforehand. Make sure it’s a full number of bars and roughly within 20 BPM of the playback tempo. If you try to stretch it too far, or leave a bunch of dead air before or after, it may not deliver great results.</p><p>You also can’t just connect the drum machine to your computer via usb and transfer files. The USB-C port here is for power only. You’ll actually have to take the microSD card out and put it in a reader to move samples around. Frankly, that’s a little cumbersome for my tastes, and I usually preferred to just record directly to the Razzmatazz. You can’t trim or alter samples once they’ve been captured, but the threshold option at least means you won’t have a ton of silence at the start of a recording.</p><h2>Interface</h2><figure><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/6927f830-856d-11ed-bff7-ff0986e5129e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, the actual act of using the Razzmatazz isn’t all that different from using a Lemondrop or Fireball. You still get a UI organized by sections, and within each section are layers and then each layer has pages. It’s a little more work to find your way around the Razzmatazz because it has eight individual voices with their own set of parameters. And sound design is a bit more complicated because the synth engine is FM based, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-elektron-model-cycles-review-affordable-fm-groovebox.html">FM is notoriously difficult</a> to wrap your head around.</p><p>But credit to 1010music for trying to streamline things as much as possible. The first layer beneath each pad is a collection of eight macro controls. And from here you can also change the “model” of the pad to quickly dial in generic sounds for kicks, snares, toms, etcetera. These two things alone let you cover a decent amount of the basics. But you’ll definitely want to explore beyond there, to all the pages you can access from the pad dashboard. Here’s where you’ll find all your oscillator options, FX sends and modulation controls.</p><section><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/69169310-856d-11ed-bef4-668dd831b6b7" /></section><p>If you hold down the home button, though, you’re brought to the “Teleporter.” Here you can jump to almost any page or submenu you want with just a single tap. It’s a much faster way to navigate the UI. In general the Razzmatazz makes better use of the touchscreen than its predecessors. That’s partially just down to the kinds of machines they are. Tapping in sequences and playing one of eight reasonably sized touch pads just makes a lot more sense, than trying to play melodies on a grid of notes sized for a toddler.</p><p>Unfortunately, the X/Y macro mode from the Lemondrop and Fireball is gone. Your performance options are largely limited to playing the pads live, switching sequences and muting individual pads. Using the touchpad to control pattern-wide parameters, or engage a stutter effect would give it a lot more flexibility as a performance tool.</p><p>On the plus side, the sequencer is extremely straightforward. It lacks ratchets, microtiming, probability and almost any other modern amenity. But its simple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-tr-6-s-review-classic-drum-machines-808-909-portable-143001780.html">TR-style</a> makes it easy to quickly toss together patterns or alter them on the fly. The main sequencer page lets you swap between patterns, and the changes are tempo synced so you won't awkwardly cut one off before its natural conclusion.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><section><img alt="1010music Razzmatazz" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/69311ff0-856d-11ed-ab55-507a31930348" /></section><p>The Razzmatazz is a welcome addition to the 1010music Nanobox family. Similar to its stablemates, the Fireball and Lemondrop, there is no direct competitor due to the depth of the sound engine and stunningly compact form factor. I’m unaware of any drum machine in the sub-$500 space that combines FM synthesis and sampling in the same way. And as far as I can tell, only Teenage Engineering’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-street-fighter-megaman-capcom-pocket-operators-161207054.html">Pocket Operators</a> come close to being as pocketable. Of course, those offer less sound design options. But combine a Razzmatazz, Lemondrop and Fireball with a small mixer like the <a href="https://shop.bastl-instruments.com/desktop/bastl-instruments-dude.html">Bastl Dude</a> or (if you like setting fire to money) the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-op1-tx6-expensive-fun-181029889.html">TE TX-6</a>, and you’ve got yourself a portable music making rig that could fit in a couple of coat pockets.</p><p>There are a few features and changes, though, that seem like no-brainers and would greatly improve the usability of the Razzmatazz. Some form of basic sample editing, for instance, expanded sequencing features like ratchets, and performance-focused master effects would really elevate the instrument. Right now the Razzmatazz is a very good drum synth, but it’s potentially only a firmware update away from being a great one.</p>

## LG teases a smaller smartphone camera module with true optical telephoto zoom

<p>LG may not make smartphones anymore, but it's still building components for them. The company's LG Innotek arm just <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/lg-innotek-reveals-the-optical-telephoto-zoom-camera-module-for-the-first-time-in-ces-301709953.html">unveiled</a> a periscope-style true optical zoom camera module with a 4-9 times telephoto range. That would allow smartphone cameras to retain full image quality through the entire zoom range, while potentially reducing the size and number of modules required.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung developed a similar camera module, also known as a "folded" lens, with a four times zoom first used in the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUFWX0MtVlROcVU0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MDFkMGJiZi1hNWYzLTRhNGItOTYyMi05YzRjZGRmMzE4YWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeEiSLDJB0H_QeIDv7YTGWwvLQPu10oXtAlE07ix5VSR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAV_C-VTNqU4">Galaxy S20 Ultra smartphone</a>. LG Innotek provided a previous version of its zoom module to Sony for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-xperia-1-iv-smartphone-has-the-worlds-first-true-optical-zoom-lens-071003899.html">Xperia 1 IV smartphone</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most smartphone cameras use hybrid zoom setups that combine digital zoom and multiple camera modules. Certain zoom ranges (typically 2x, 3x, 10x, etc.) use individual cameras, with a digital zoom to fill in between those (2.5x, 4.5x, etc.). As a result, sensor resolution and thus detail can be considerably reduced.</p><p>LG's "Optical Zoom Camera," however, contains a zoom actuator with movable components, similar to what you'd seen on a zoom lens in a mirrorless or DSLR camera. It operates quickly and precisely down to the micrometer, according to LG, while saving battery life. It also has a built-in optical image stabilizer to reduce blur, something that can be a problem for telephoto lenses that magnify hand movements. (iFixit shows exactly how such modules work <a href="https://youtu.be/AV_C-VTNqU4?t=119">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>With the module installed, a sensor would retain full resolution through the entire 4-9x zoom range, providing more detail on telephoto shots. LG also pared down the module's thickness to reduce the size of the camera bump.&nbsp;</p><p>The company partnered with Qualcomm to integrate the tech in the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform. "It will enhance the image tuning custom for the optics, which includes Auto-Focus, Auto-Exposure, Auto-White Balance, lens shading correction and much more. Users will be able to focus quickly. And the photos and videos will have stunning image quality," LG wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>The new module will appear in smartphones announced at CES 2023 starting January 3rd. LG didn't reveal any brands or models, but there are a number of smartphones coming soon with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset that could potentially use it. Those include the OnePlus 11 series, Xiaomi 13, Motorola X40 and Oppo Find X. Apple is also a large customer of LG Innotek and could use the zoom module in next year's iPhone 15 series, according to <a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3988">previous reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## LG's new minimalistic appliances have upgradeable features and fewer controls

<p>LG’s latest upgraded appliances, including washing machines, refrigerators, ovens and a dishwasher, feature, well, less. It’s taking a more minimalist approach in 2023 with less showy profiles, colors and, seemingly, controls. While we’re not getting a close-up look at all the dials and buttons, the appliances look restrained compared to previous years’ appliances. In recent years, we’ve seen a washing machine whose feature was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-05-lg-baby-washing-machine.html">an entire extra washing machine</a>. There was also a dryer that had two doors. Just because. LG also once even experimented with creating washing machines that could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-17-lg-senior-vp-washing-machine-no-water.html">clean your clothes without any water.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>This year's appliances will have a simpler design language, with what LG says is an &quot;elegantly clear control experience.&quot; The company says it’s made its latest range to ensure it can “match with any kind of décor, color scheme, or interior trend.” It used recycled materials across multiple machine parts, adding that its latest appliances also require fewer total parts and less energy than typical kitchen appliances.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This would dovetail with the company’s announcements at the start of the year, where LG said it would offer upgradability for its home appliances. So far, that’s included new filters for certain use cases and software upgrades to offer new washing programs for laundry machines. The company said it planned to introduce 20 models with upgradeable features but hasn’t confirmed <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2022/01/lg-sets-new-paradigm-with-upgradable-home-appliances-that-deliver-more-benefits-over-time/">how many actually arrived</a>. Simpler, more streamlined hardware could make for easier for LG to replace more substantial parts, like motors and heating elements, to be even more efficient or effective.</p><p>However, will fewer buttons mean fewer features or less flexibility? We don’t know yet, but I like the subtler aesthetic. LG will reveal its new appliance family at CES 2023 — a show that always sneaks in countless kitchen appliances alongside the latest TVs, EVs and more. The show kicks off in Las Vegas in a week’s time.</p>

<p>German researchers who purchased biometric capture devices on eBay found sensitive US military data stored on their memory cards, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Zvci1zYWxlLW9uLWViYXktYS1taWxpdGFyeS1kYXRhYmFzZS1vZi1maW5nZXJwcmludHMtYW5kLWlyaXMtc2NhbnMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzg2MGQ4YzYtY2E0Zi00NjkxLWFiNWYtYWVmYzFjMmQ1NmYyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUX6d0lSWm4tqbWysrBfNiTzVPDj0etQEH3fn91svFcQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F27%2Ftechnology%2Ffor-sale-on-ebay-a-military-database-of-fingerprints-and-iris-scans.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported. That included fingerprints, iris scans, photographs, names and descriptions of the individuals, mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan. Many worked with the US army and could be targeted if the devices fell into the wrong hands, according to the report.</p><p>A group of researchers called the Chaos Computer Club, led by Matthias Marx, bought six of the devices on eBay, most for under $200. They were spurred by a 2021 report from <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/17/afghanistan-taliban-military-biometrics/"><em>The Intercept</em></a> that the Taliban had seized similar US military biometric devices. As such, they wanted to see if they contained identifying data on people who assisted the US Military that could put them at risk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They were "shocked" by the results, according to the report. On the memory card of one device, they found the names, nationalities, photographs, fingerprints and iris scans of 2,632 people. Other metadata showed it had been used near Kandahar, Afghanistan in the summer of 2012. Another device was used in Jordan in 2013 and contained the fingerprints and iris scans of a small group of US military personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>Such devices were used to identify insurgents, verify local and third-country nationals accessing US bases and link people to events, according to a 2011 guide to the devices. "It was disturbing that [the US military] didn’t even try to protect the data,” Marx told the <em>NY Times</em>. “They didn’t care about the risk, or they ignored the risk.</p><p>One device was purchased at a military auction, and the seller said they were not aware that it contained sensitive data. The sensitive information was stored on a memory card, so the US military could have eliminated the risk by simply removing or destroying the cards before selling them.</p><p>"Because we have not reviewed the information contained on the devices, the department is not able to confirm the authenticity of the alleged data or otherwise comment on it," Defense Department press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder told the <em>Times</em>. "The department requests that any devices thought to contain personally identifiable information be returned for further analysis."</p><p>Given the sensitivity of the information, the group plans to delete any personally identifiable information found on the devices. Another researcher noted that any individuals found on such devices aren't safe even if they changed their identities, and should be given asylum by the US government.&nbsp;</p>

## LG's 2023 soundbars offer Dolby Atmos and wireless TV connections

<p>Keeping its tradition of making several announcements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html">before CES</a>, LG has teased its 2023 soundbar lineup ahead of the big show. The company says the SC9 and SE6 models will be on display in Vegas, both equipped with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X for immersive sound. Details are scarce for now on the specifics, but LG did elaborate on some of the key features both soundbars will offer.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the company says the SC9 and SE6 will have Wow Orchestra, a tool that &quot;utilizes every one of the two products’ audio channels to create an expanded soundstage with improved height, depth and power.&quot; That somewhat vague description is all we have to go on until we hear these in action, but LG did explain that the feature will arrive after launch via software update. The two soundbars will also use Wowcast to connect to LG TVs wirelessly over WiFi. Once synced up, you can access audio settings through the Home Dashboard on those displays (also coming via future update).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Triple Sound Optimizer feature &quot;boosts&quot; the performance of the SC9 and SE6 while Smart Up-mixer turns stereo audio into multi-channel surround sound. LG says its AI Room Calibration tailors each soundbar to the place you put them, improving low-end frequency range and subdividing the front channels for better balance, clearer vocals and enhanced dialogue. The SC9 and SE6 also have an AI Sound Pro feature that can analyze content — movies, games sports or music — and automatically apply the best settings.&nbsp;</p><p>LG says the SC9 and SE6 were designed with a minimalist focus so that they might blend in better with a range of home furnishings. The company explains that a bracket for the SC9 attaches to LG’s 2022 and 2023 OLED C series TVs to further eliminate clutter. LG didn't elaborate much on the differences between the two units other than the fact that the SE6 is &quot;ideal for smaller spaces&quot; due to its compact stature. Despite the smaller size, that soundbar still packs four passive radiators for &quot;powerful bass,&quot; according to LG, and Dolby Atmos support is still onboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The company didn't say whether or not either of these will come with a subwoofer or which additional speakers they'll be compatible with for a true surround sound setup. But, we expect all of the finer details on that, as well as info on connectivity and availability, when we arrive in Las Vegas next week.&nbsp;</p>
