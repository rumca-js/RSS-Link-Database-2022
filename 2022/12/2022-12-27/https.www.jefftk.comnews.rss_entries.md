A few weeks ago I </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/wider-default-audio-player-in-chrome">griped</a> about how
the default audio player in Chrome is too narrow, and how this makes
it hard to seek accurately.  I realized yesterday, though, that
there's an easy work-around: zooming.  By pinch-zooming I can make the
seek bar almost the whole width of my phone, which is a big
improvement:

</p>

It's not perfect: it's not super discoverable and it still doesn't
make great use of the available vertical space (showing timing and
seeking at the same time would be nice) but I'm very happy I've found
this.
