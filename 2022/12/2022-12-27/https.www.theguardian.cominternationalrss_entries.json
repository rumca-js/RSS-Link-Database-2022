As someone who sleeps through almost everything, I know the level of hum only because it has kept me company reading or scrolling on my phone. The issue goes away in winter, when the fridge, with less to do, is turned down, meaning the hum is more of a vibration through the tiles. Which are also warm.

Occasionally, bereavement develops into depression, which in itself can shut down sexual interest or functioning. It is unfortunate that you and your partner are having different sexual reactions as you work through loss and try to heal, but recognise that you are simply experiencing different sexual responses to grief and, if possible, share those feelings with each other to feel more heard. Grief counselling could be very helpful. Your bereavement is relatively new, but if healing does not appear to be progressing it will be essential to seek help. At any point in a relationship it is extremely common for sex to hold different meanings for each partner.
