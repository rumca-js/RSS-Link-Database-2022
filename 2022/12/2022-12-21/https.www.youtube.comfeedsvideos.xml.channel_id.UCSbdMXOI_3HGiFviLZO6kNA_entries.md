Hello and welcome to Tuesday Newsday! Your number one resource for the entre weeks worth of VR news!

This one is one of the more important TNs- of course we have fun stuff to talk about like the Contact Gloves (VR gloves coming at a consumer price early next year), HTC's new VR headset, some new games, and more.. but we have a more pressing matter to analyze. John Carmack, one of the original pioneers of this current era of VR has announced his complete departure from the VR industry and from Meta (Carmack is one of the guys that really pushed for the Quest 2). So in order to explain what's currently happening in the VR space, lets talk about hype cycles an we'll fully deconstruct what this means for the industry currently and in the near/ far future- Also some Quest 3 stuff :D

Hope you enjoyed!
