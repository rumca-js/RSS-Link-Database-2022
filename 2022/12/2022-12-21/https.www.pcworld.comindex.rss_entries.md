<p>If you&rsquo;re involved in the tech space at all, you&rsquo;ve probably heard about the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi</a>, an itty-bitty $35 micro-computer that runs Linux. Makers swear by the versatile mini-PC and its project-friendly hardware features, or you can even hook it up to a monitor or TV and use it as a personal computer. It&rsquo;s a fantastic way to beef up your programming or tinkering skills. It&rsquo;s affordable, too. Although global supply chain issues have directly impacted the production of this single-board computer, and we won&rsquo;t be getting a new Raspberry Pi 5 in 2023, there&rsquo;s also a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-update-its-good-news/&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> by Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton, the company set aside a little over 100,000 units for single-unit sales this holiday season. Upton recommends that you buy from approved resellers and to use tools like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rpilocator.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">rpilocator</a> to check when new stock arrives. They also expect stock to return to &ldquo;pre-pandemic levels&rdquo; in the second half of 2023. Things are starting to look up, yeah? That said, there&rsquo;s been a price increase on certain models.</p>



<p>The cost of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> increased from $5 to $10 and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Zero W</a> from $10 to $15. This is a direct hit from the global supply chain crisis. However, the company expects to return to &ldquo;volume availability&rdquo; in 2023, which means you&rsquo;ll be able to buy as many as you want at that time. While things are definitely improving, Raspberry Pi will be in recovery mode for some time, so don&rsquo;t expect any new releases anytime soon&mdash;as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-5-after-2023&amp;xcust=2-1-1440616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware reports</a>, Upton recently said flat-out &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect a Pi 5 next year.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Usually PC builders are trying to get the most power possible into a specific setup. But Gordon Mah Ung, PCWorld Executive Editor and gleefully cackling agent of chaos, is aiming for something a little different with the latest PCWorld video. His &ldquo;Island of Misfit Toys&rdquo; build, a Frankenstein monster of components from a series of cursed machines, is aiming to get the <em>worst </em>score in the Cinebench benchmark. </p>



<p>Along with special guest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1r0DG-KEPyqOeW6o79PByw&amp;xcust=2-3-1441598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ian Cutress</a>, Gordon gives a tour of his tortured machine. It&rsquo;s powered by the Gigabyte P750GM, which <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/1930&amp;xcust=2-3-1441598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">has a reputation for exploding</a>. The motherboard is an ancient, forgotten <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTX_(form_factor)&amp;xcust=2-3-1441598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BTX design</a> from a Dell pre-built desktop, with a plastic shroud over the Celeron D processor that sucks in cooling airflow. That cooling setup makes it impossible to plug in a modern GPU, so Gordon had to connect a Radeon Fury X card with an NZXT PCIe riser cable&hellip;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394086/nzxt-issues-a-formal-recall-for-the-xbox-like-h1-case.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">which has been recalled as a fire hazard</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>And the whole thing is running Windows Vista Ultimate on a 160GB spinning hard drive. This is the most low-power build possible, with a 64-bit desktop CPU and a PCIe port for discrete graphics. The parts don&rsquo;t fit in a case. It&rsquo;s an absolute freakshow of a computer. And, as if its mere existence wasn&rsquo;t painful enough, Gordon and Ian are going to torture it with Cinebench. </p>



<p>I won&rsquo;t spoil the results of the video for you, but I&rsquo;ll say that Gordon is trying to beat (as in, score lower than) a Cinebench R15 single-thread score of 17, which <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3sLdM7pS8c&amp;t=0s&amp;xcust=2-3-1441598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ian achieved with a similar PC</a> several years ago. For a point of comparison, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s latest flagship CPU</a> gets a single-thread Cinebench R23 score of around 2300. My home-built work desktop, with a 4-year-old mid-range CPU and a dozen running programs, manages 1006 with a maximum possible score of around 1275. </p>

<p>With malware and other threats coming from a variety of sources, you need a security product that can protect you no matter where you are and what you&rsquo;re doing. F-Secure Safe is one program with that goal in mind.</p>



<p>Starting off with basic antivirus protection, the software aims to ward off trojans, ransomware, and spyware. From there, the browsing protection built into the core program and its browser extension steers you away from malicious websites. The banking protection automatically attempts to secure your online banking transactions. And the parental controls try to protect your kids from inappropriate content and help you manage their screen time. Also included in the mix is identity protection, which monitors your email addresses and credit cards for breaches and offers an optional password manager.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our </em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/computers/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html"><em>best antivirus roundup</em></a><em>. Go there for details about competing products and how we tested them.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>F-Secure Safe is available for a variety of platforms, including Windows 7 SP1 (support ends in August 2023), Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS 10.15 Catalina or later, iOS 14 or later, and Android 8.0 or later.</p>



<p>Like most paid security products, F-Secure Safe charges you an annual subscription rate based on the number of PCs or devices you want to protect&mdash;$34.99 for three devices for one year; $44.99 for five devices for one year; $54.99 for seven devices for one year. A convenient 30-day free trial lets you take the full program for a spin; no credit card or payment info required.</p>



<h2 id="f-secure-safe-installation">F-Secure Safe: Installation</h2>



<p>Installation is quick and easy. To download the program, you&rsquo;re prompted to create an account. You can choose to install the program on your current PC or another device. After installation, your subscription or free trial kicks off, and you&rsquo;re deposited at the dashboard where you receive confirmation that you&rsquo;re now protected and are able to view and use the core features.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="F-Secure SAFE dashboard" class="wp-image-1439670" height="681" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-F-Secure-Safe-for-Windows-Review.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The F-Secure Safe</p><span>dashboard confirms that the necessary protections are in place and lets you view and run all the key features.</span><br /> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">F-Secure</p></div>



<h2 id="f-secure-safe-features">F-Secure Safe: Features</h2>



<p>The dashboard is well designed, offering you access to the different options by category. Under <em>People &amp; Devices</em>, you can see which people and devices are currently subscribed to F-Secure Safe and add more devices or users to the mix.</p>



<p>Under <em>Viruses &amp; Threats</em>, you can run a manual virus scan. Here, you&rsquo;re able to choose between a quick scan to check specific Windows system files and a full computer scan to check your entire system. The scan keeps you informed as to whether it finds anything harmful. Afterwards, the protection history for each scan lets you review when it ran, how many files it checked, and whether it uncovered any malware.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="F-Secure SAFE scan" class="wp-image-1439674" height="632" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-F-Secure-Safe-for-Windows-Review.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>F-Secure Safe keeps you abreast of the progress as you run a manual scan and provides access to your protection history.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">F-Secure</p></div>



<p>Next, you can temporarily turn off all protection and check for updates. You can also submit a virus sample through the F-Secure website, check your Windows Firewall, and view any quarantined or blocked malware. Plus, the dashboard provides the necessary access to ID protection and monitoring to prevent identity theft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The F-Secure Safe settings offer access to a variety of options divided into different categories. Here, you can review and disable the virus protection, antimalware scanning, and web traffic scanning. You can control the manual scan as well as schedule a scan for a particular date, time, and frequency. Further, you&rsquo;re able to manage the browsing and banking protection features. The <em>Settings</em> screen packs a lot of options into one place, but it&rsquo;s all well organized and easy to use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="F-Secure SAFE settings" class="wp-image-1439675" height="665" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-F-Secure-Safe-for-Windows-Review.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The settings screen for F-Secure Safe lets you easily access and control all of the options.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">F-Secure</p></div>



<p>The dashboard smartly prompts you to add the F-Secure Safe extension to Microsoft Edge as well as Google Chrome and Firefox. The extension enhances the overall browsing protection and tries to defend your online banking transactions from compromise.</p>



<h2 id="f-secure-safe-performance">F-Secure Safe: Performance</h2>



<p>In real-world testing, F-Secure Safe proved itself effective and capable, at least for the most part. With the browsing protection enabled, the software warned me of potentially harmful sites while giving me an option to allow the site and report it as a false positive if I knew it was legitimate.</p>



<p>A manual scan found the three malicious test files on my PC and asked me whether I wanted the software to handle them. However, when I gave the program the OK to proceed, it told me that it was unable to clean two of the files because they were contained in a ZIP archive. On the plus side, trying to manually run the same executable files within the ZIP did prompt F-Secure Safe to catch and quarantine them.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="F-Secure SAFE manual scan" class="wp-image-1439681" height="632" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-F-Secure-Safe-for-Windows-Review.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A manual scan caught malicious files on my PC but was unable to clean the files stored inside ZIP archives.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">F-Secure</p></div>



<p>Downloading the different test files from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/&amp;xcust=2-3-407847-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">EICAR testing site</a> prompted the software to flag them as harmful and automatically quarantine them. An <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-11/august-2022/f-secure-safe-18-221408/&amp;xcust=2-3-407847-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AV-Test review from July/August 2022</a> gave F-Secure Safe top marks for protection and usability and solid grades for performance. A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/real-world-protection-test-july-october-2020/&amp;xcust=2-3-407847-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">review from AV Comparatives in 2020</a> awarded the program high marks for protection but gave it dings for too many false positives.</p>



<p>Adding an old email address to the ID monitoring displayed a report listing past breaches in which my address was exposed. I liked the level of detail in the report as it included the name and date of the breach, my username, my password (if available), the data that was compromised, and recommendations.</p>



<p>The password vault was more difficult and time-consuming to set up compared with most dedicated password managers. But following the setup, the associated browser extension would automatically log me into websites, while the vault was able to flag any weak passwords.</p>



<p>The parental controls were easy to implement. I could send a link to install the software for a child&rsquo;s account. Setting up the software took me through the screens to select parental rules, so I could opt to limit use to certain days and times and filter specific types of content.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="F-Secure SAFE family rules" class="wp-image-1439682" height="596" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-F-Secure-Safe-for-Windows-Review.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Installing the program under a child&rsquo;s account offered me screens to set up the necessary parental rules and controls.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">F-Secure</p></div>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-f-secure-safe">Should you buy F-Secure Safe?</h2>



<p>F-Secure Safe provides solid malware protection and extras like ID protection, password management, and parental controls. For the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck. And despite all the features crammed into one package, the software is relatively easy to use and manage.&nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p id="E146">The Dell G16 is a midrange gaming PC that prioritizes function over form. It&rsquo;ll serve you well if you are looking for the biggest pixel-pushing bang for your gaming buck and are willing to put up with an uninspired design to get it. Beneath the grab, gray exterior is a powerful CPU-GPU duo &mdash;&nbsp; the Core i7-12700H processor and RTX 3060 graphics &mdash; that puts this laptop at the head of the midrange gaming pack.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="E146">The 16-inch display offers a QHD resolution that&rsquo;s one notch above the FHD panel usually on offer at this price and gives the Dell G16 added versatility. You likely won&rsquo;t run games above 1080p with the RTX 3060, but the higher resolution provides more room to multitasking on the 16:10 display and a finer picture for detailed graphics work. On the whole, the Dell G16 looks like a budget gaming laptop that delivers strong midrange gaming performance for a price that is somewhere between budget and midrange. And when it&rsquo;s on sale, its price nearly dips into budget territory where it offers great value.</p>

<h2 id="dell-g16-boring-bulky-design">Dell G16: Boring, bulky design</h2>



<p id="E221">The Dell G16 is unlikely to turn heads. The chunky chassis features a mix of plastic and aluminum in a boring dark gray color that looks like a better fit for a corporate workhorse than a gaming rig. There is very little about the design that disguises the Dell G16 as a gaming laptop. Perhaps the crisscrossing vents on the diagonal above the keyboard are a hint, or the red &ldquo;G&rdquo; logos on the wrist rest and right edge. (It&rsquo;s hard to tell if the &ldquo;G&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; or just &ldquo;gray.&rdquo;) The G16&rsquo;s design is about as straightforward as it gets.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell G16 lid" class="wp-image-1439447" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E221">Most of the chassis is made from plastic, including the keyboard deck, bottom panel and bezels framing the display. The lid is made from aluminum and provides rigid protection for the display. Despite being plastic, the keyboard deck feels sturdy with little to no flex. The tradeoff for this sturdiness is heftiness. The Dell G16 tips the scales at 5.7 pounds, which is substantially heavier than other 16-inch models we&rsquo;ve reviewed. By comparison, the HP Envy 16 weighs 5 pounds, the Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 weighs 4.7 pounds, and the Lenovo ThinkPad Z16 weighs only 4.3 pounds. The Dell G16 is also portly at 1.1 inches thick. There&rsquo;s nothing about the design that feels sleek or modern other than the display&rsquo;s aspect ratio.</p>



<p id="E221">Gaming laptops of yore were either 15.6-inch models or 17.3-inch models with a wide 16:9 aspect ratio. The Dell G16 is a member of a new generation of laptop based on a 16-inch display with a taller 16:10 aspect ratio. With more space from top to bottom, the display feels much roomier than a 15.6-inch 16:9 display and roughly the same as a larger 17.3-inch 16:9 display. The taller aspect ratio isn&rsquo;t useful for games, but it provides more room for multitasking during general Windows use and means you&rsquo;ll need to scroll less through long documents and web pages.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell G16 display" class="wp-image-1439448" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E237">Likewise, the QHD resolution isn&rsquo;t all that useful for games, especially with a midrange RTX 3060, since it&rsquo;s doubtful you&rsquo;ll crank the resolution past 1080p. But this finer resolution provides a sharper picture than a FHD panel &mdash; text and edges of images look crisper and allow the Dell G16 to double as a content creation machine in between gaming sessions. This versatility adds to the G16&rsquo;s overall value, and it&rsquo;s priced aggressively to begin with.</p>



<p id="E243">The display&rsquo;s 165Hz refresh rate is pretty much the standard for a midrange laptop and results in smooth visuals. With the RTX 3060 unlikely to push frame rates past 165 fps with any frequency, it more than suffices. The display&rsquo;s brightness is also ample; I measured a maximum of 460 nits, which is far better than the 250- or 300-nit panels found on most budget models and some midrange models.</p>



<p id="E246">The 720p webcam is a disappointment. Nearly every laptop we&rsquo;ve seen this year with the exception of truly budget models features a 1080p camera that produces a superior image. The Dell G16&rsquo;s 720p webcam produces poorly exposed images that lack detail in dark and light areas and are beset with noise.</p>



<p id="E249">Many gaming and entertainment-minded laptops find room for four speakers for better, fuller sound, but the G16 sticks with the standard pair of stereo speakers. They have enough oomph to fill a small room but the clarity declines as you push the volume toward its max. And even at 50 percent, the sound is not dynamic and lacks a bass response.</p>



<h2 id="dell-g16-mushy-keys-tiny-touchpad">Dell G16: Mushy keys, tiny touchpad</h2>



<p id="E254">The only nod to gamers on the keyboard is the outlining and bold lettering on the WASD quartet of keys. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a standard keyboard. The keys are soft to the point of feeling a bit too mushy. I would have preferred a firmer feel with a snappier response. The keyboard lacks a number pad, and in its place is a column of volume-control keys. I&rsquo;d argue those are more useful than squeezing in a numpad. There&rsquo;s also a microphone-mute key in this column, but there&rsquo;s no key to kill the webcam. And without a physical shutter, the Dell G16 provides no way to ensure your privacy when the camera isn&rsquo;t in use. The lack of a numpad also means you get four full-size arrow keys, which is always appreciated.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell G16 keyboard" class="wp-image-1439450" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E261">The keyboard features RGB backlighting but at its most basic. It&rsquo;s one-zone lighting that you can control via the Alienware Command Center app. You can set the lighting to be static or choose from a handful of animations. We don&rsquo;t expect per-key RGB lighting on a midrange gaming laptop, but four-zone lighting certainly isn&rsquo;t unprecedented on a $1,500 model.</p>



<p id="E264">The touchpad is woefully undersized. The keyboard is shifted down on the keyboard deck to accommodate the wide venting at the top, which leaves little room for the touchpad below the display. And like the keys themselves, the touchpad&rsquo;s click response feels a bit mushy with too much travel required to perform a click. You&rsquo;ll want to keep your headphones handy because of the average-at-best speakers, and you&rsquo;ll also want to keep your mouse nearby because of the subpar touchpad.</p>



<p id="E267">The Dell G16 features a useful selection of ports, but I&rsquo;d like to see a second Thunderbolt 4 port and would happily trade one of the three USB Type-A ports for it. The laptop features a barrel charger, so at least you can keep the Thunderbolt 4 port free while you are charging the system.</p>



<p id="E271">You&rsquo;ll find ports on either side of the system:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell G16 left ports" class="wp-image-1439453" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-left-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>

<p id="E279">And there are more ports on the back:</p>

<h2 id="dell-g16-performance">Dell G16: Performance</h2>



<p id="E288">As you&rsquo;ll soon see, the Dell G16 is a strong midrange performer, posting strong results on our application and multimedia tests as well as our graphics and gaming tests. We compared its performance to that of other RTX 3060-based gaming laptops as well as a Lenovo Legion 5 Pro with RTX 3070 graphic and a pair with RTX 3050 Ti graphics.</p>



<p id="E290">Despite its heavily vented, bulky chassis, the Dell G16 was one of the noisier gaming laptops we&rsquo;ve tested. Its cooling fans kicked in not only during our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but they also revved up during our multimedia tests. And they get loud! They even ran constantly while we streamed YouTube videos.</p>



<p id="E295">First up is PCMark 10, which measures performance on everyday computing work including office productivity tasks, web browsing, and video chats. The Dell G16 finished first, beating out the other systems with the same Core i7-12700H CPU as well as the two with the Core i9-12900H chips.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 PCMark" class="wp-image-1439460" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-PCMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E301">Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Dell G16 finished second to the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE, and this pair had a substantial advantage over the rest.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1439461" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E307">Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. The Dell G16 again finished second, this time to the Dell XPS 17 9720. The two Dells along with the MSI Katana GF76 were the clear winners on Cinebench.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 Cinebench" class="wp-image-1439462" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-Cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="899" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="dell-g16-graphics-performance">Dell G16: Graphics performance</h2>



<p id="E315">Our first 3D graphics tests are two benchmarks from 3DMark &mdash; Time Spy and Port Royal. The Dell G16 did well on both tests, finishing first among the RTX 3060 systems and trailing only the RTX 3070-based Lenovo Legion 5 Pro.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 Time Spy" class="wp-image-1439466" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-Time-Spy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="897" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 Port Royal" class="wp-image-1439468" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-Port-Royal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="902" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p id="E323">Moving on to real-world games, we first run <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> at 1920&times;1080 resolution set to Very High and in DX11 mode. The Dell G16 turned in a frame rate of 131 fps, which was tops among the RTX 3060 systems. On the newer <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 1920&times;1080 resolution, the Dell G16 averaged an impressive 114fps, which was again first among the RTX 3060 laptops. Finally, on&nbsp; the more demanding <em>Metro Exodus</em> at 1920&times;1080 at the benchmark&rsquo;s Extreme preset, the Dell G16 averaged 36fps, which was a few frames-per-second ahead of the rest of the RTX 3060 laptops and trailed only the 50 fps of the RTX 3070-based Lenovo Legion 5 Pro.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 Rise of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1439469" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-RoTR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>

<h2 id="dell-g16-battery-life">Dell G16: Battery life</h2>



<p id="E335">To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. The Dell G16&rsquo;s 84 watt-hour battery lasted six hours on our battery rundown test, which is a bit below average. You won&rsquo;t be able to stray too far from a wall outlet with the Dell G16.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell G16 battery life" class="wp-image-1439475" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dell-G16-battery-life.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="dell-g16-strong-midrange-performer">Dell G16: Strong midrange performer</h2>



<p id="E342">The Dell G16 isn&rsquo;t much to look at, with its mostly plastic design that&rsquo;s both boring and bulky. The high-resolution, 16-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio lends the laptop utility beyond gaming and this added versatility improves the system&rsquo;s value proposition. For gaming alone, however, it offers tremendous value as one of the most powerful RTX 3060-based laptops we&rsquo;ve tested. Midrange buyers who want the best performance for their dollar and don&rsquo;t need the flashiest design ought to consider the Dell G16.</p>
