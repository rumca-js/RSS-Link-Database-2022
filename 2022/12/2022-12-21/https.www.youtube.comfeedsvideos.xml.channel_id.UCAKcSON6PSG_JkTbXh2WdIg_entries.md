When deciding what to name their band, the term for the residual heat left on a chair after an individual has vacated it seemed the perfect fit: Manheat. Hailing from Duluth, Minnesota, Manheat display their hard-rock sensibilities by playing loud and fast.

Manheat stopped by The Local Show in support of their appearance at the Duluth Homegrown Festival, running May 1 to 8, 2011. @duluthhomegrown
