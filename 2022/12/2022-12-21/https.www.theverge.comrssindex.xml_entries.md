  <p id="wuYqfE">Kelly Conlon, an attorney from New Jersey, says she wasn’t allowed to see a Rockettes show at Radio City Music Hall after she was identified by a facial recognition system, according to a report <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/face-recognition-tech-gets-girl-scout-mom-booted-from-rockettes-show-due-to-her-employer/4004677/">from NBC New York</a>. Conlon told the outlet that guards approached her while she was in the building’s lobby and said she wasn’t allowed to be there because of her connection to a legal case against the company that owns the hall. </p>
<p id="QRMil4">“I believe they said that our recognition picked you up,” she told NBC, saying that she was asked to identify herself and that “they knew my name before I told them. They knew the firm I was associated with before I told them.” She says she ended up waiting outside while her daughter watched the show with other members...</p>

  <p id="AQCiXT">On Mars, another machine just bit the dust. The marsquake-detecting, photo-snapping InSight lander has now officially completed its mission and will now spend its retirement in the same place it spent its career — sitting on a flat plain on the Martian surface, as dust slowly accumulates on its solar panels and other instruments. </p>
<p id="lbDHKj">We’ve known this was coming for a while. InSight’s solar panels, which generate electricity for the lander, have been getting covered with dust ever since they unfurled. The mission, officially known as the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight), was expected to run out of power this summer, but a <a href="https://www.space.com/mars-insight-lander-running-out-of-power">spate of good weather</a> bought it a few additional months of work on...</p>

  <p id="6zJlUh">Meta is giving Quest 2 developers 7 percent more GPU compute power to work with, meaning apps and games on the headset you already own might look a little bit better sometime soon.</p>
<p id="Ge3IKm">For developers, the increased power should “improve your ability to leverage higher pixel density without substantially reducing the resolution in order to hit the target frame rate,” <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/boost-app-performance-525-mhz-gpu-frequency-meta-quest-2/">Meta wrote in a blog post</a>. Phrased a different way, “this means your apps’ visuals will look even better—without sacrificing resolution quality,” Meta says.</p>
<p id="3lyluo">The change is possible thanks to the Quest using a new 525MHz GPU frequency, which is up from the previous 490MHz, and Meta’s “dynamic clocking system” will automatically up the frequency when it senses an app could use it....</p>

The $799 Ultra was billed as <em>the</em> Apple Watch for outdoor adventurers and triathletes. So we spent the last three months devising a series of mini-reviews targeting several of the Ultra’s marquee features. </p>
<p id="WmnF16">For starters, we wanted to see how well the Ultra’s revamped Compass app and 86db emergency siren worked on an off-the-grid hike. So, my colleagues Becca Farsace and Vjeran Pavic got lost with the Ultra in Yosemite National Park to test the limits of the Ultra’s navigational capabilities and its Backtrack feature. Plus, we pitted the Ultra’s Siren against a $4 safety whistle to see which had the wider range.</p>

  <p id="OTL08c">It has been difficult to find great laptops this year. That’s partially because 2022 has been a bit of a building year for some companies, especially on the consumer side. It’s also because of the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/atom/p.html">Intel P-series</a>. </p>
<p id="2GadBc">I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review">reviewed a number of laptops in 2022</a> across consumer, workstation, gaming, business, Chromebook, and everywhere else.

That’s not necessarily a surprise; Musk has de-facto control over product at most of his companies, and he’s still Twitter’s owner at the end of the day.
