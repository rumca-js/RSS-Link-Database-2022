She was found dead in the bathtub of her LA hotel room in 2012 at just 48 with evidence of cocaine use.

But how then should we judge satirists? Often their works are taken at face value, assumed to be advocating what they are, in fact, satirising. Judgment is, therefore, frequently harsh. In 1703 Daniel Defoe was sentenced to be pilloried after his satirical pamphlet The Shortest Way With the Dissenters ironically advocated their wholesale slaughter as a satire on extreme Anglicanism.</p><p>After the 18th century, through which satire had run like an open sewer, something similar befell the satirical engraver James Gillray. As Tim Clayton admits at the start of his new study of the caricaturist, little is known or knowable about the man himself, so for more than two centuries Gillray has been judged solely by his works. These are typified by a print I discovered recently showing the <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1851-0901-79\" title=\"\">Marquess of Rockingham</a> simultaneously defecating into a bucket labelled \u201cPublick Reservoir\u201d and puking into a tricorn hat to provide relief for the poor. It\u2019s almost a type specimen of an 18th-century satirical print: scatalogical, disrespectful, rude and brutally funny. The clincher, though, on top of the exquisite skill in design and execution, is that double evacuation.
