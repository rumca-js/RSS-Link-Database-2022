The visit comes as Congress is considering an omnibus spending bill that includes $45 billion of emergency assistence to Ukraine, and, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-biden-e7ff8b76657a778d4921b7345682966c\">as the AP reported</a>, as &quot;... the White House braces for greater resistance from a Republican-controlled House that\u2019s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for Ukraine in the new Congress. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has said his party\u2019s lawmakers will not write a 'blank check' for Ukraine.&quot; This will be Zelenskyy's second address to Congress, the first having been remotely delivered in March. The first, 20-minute address can be viewed <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?518685-1/ukrainian-president-zelensky-calls-us-back-fly-zone-provide-defensive-weapons\">here on C-SPAN</a>.</p> <p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/122022-2\">requested</a> that of her colleagues be &quot;physically present&quot; this evening, writing:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are ending a very special session of the 117th Congress with legislation that makes progress for the American people as well as support for our Democracy.
