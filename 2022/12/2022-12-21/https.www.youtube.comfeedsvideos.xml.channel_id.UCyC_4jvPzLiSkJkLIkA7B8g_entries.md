Lyrics: 
Presents wrapped
And gifts they hide
The dreams are wrapped in boxes
Would we keep them locked inside?
As a child, I wished
For endless joys
I believed my letters would turn
Into brand-new toys

Life has made me wise
But here at Christmastime
I catch a glimpse of light
Behind my childlike eyes

Who says there can't be magic
When the world's in doubt?
Who says there can't be joy
When the lights go out?
While the hope is in the air
Will we love more than we fear?
Who says there can't be magic
All year?

Forgotten plans
No longer seen
Below my disappointment
I uncover my old dreams
A string of lights
The longer glow
It only takes one light bulb
To illuminate the whole

Life can be so hard
But Christmas helps me start
To see I'm not too far away
From my childlike heart

Who says there can't be magic
When the world's in doubt?
Who says there can't be joy
When the lights go out?
While the hope is in the air
Will we love more than we fear?
Who says there can't be magic
All year?

Who says there can't be magic?
