<p>Netflix announced today that Nike Training Club workout videos are heading to the streaming service. The first batch of videos will be available for all Netflix subscribers starting on December 30th.</p><p>Nike Training Club videos were previously exclusive to the iOS and Android app, which guides users through workout programs and wellness strategies. Nike says it will upload over 30 hours of videos to Netflix, released in two parts and available in 10 languages. Before arriving on Netflix, the only way to watch them on a big screen was to connect your phone to a TV, either through an HDMI cable or wirelessly with AirPlay or a Chromecast. Considering the limitations of working out while staring at a phone screen, starting a video from Netflix should give you one less excuse to avoid exercising (while helping Nike expand the app’s reach).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first collection includes five programs spread across 46 videos. “Kickstart Fitness with the Basics” (13 episodes), “Two Weeks to a Stronger Core” (seven episodes), “Fall in Love with Vinyasa Yoga” (six episodes), “HIT &amp; Strength with Tara” (14 episodes) and “Feel-Good Fitness” (six episodes) all arrive at the end of December. A second batch will arrive in 2023. Once the series is available, you can find them in a Nike collection on Netflix or by searching for “Nike.”</p><p>Nike Training Club was among the first high-profile mobile apps when it launched in 2009. It asks you to input your fitness goals and then uses workout videos, customized warmups, tips and motivation to help you stay on track. The service added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-25-nike-training-club-for-apple-watch.html">Apple Watch support</a> in 2018 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nike-training-club-adaptive-workouts-accessibility-133029359.html">adaptive workouts for people with disabilities</a> earlier this year.</p>

## Okta had another security incident, this time involving stolen source code

<p>Okta is responding to a major security incident for the second time this year. As first reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oktas-source-code-stolen-after-github-repositories-hacked/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a>, Okta began notifying customers earlier today via email of an event that saw an unnamed party steal the company’s source code. In early December, Okta was notified by GitHub of possible suspicious access to its online code repositories. Following an investigation, Okta determined someone had used that access to copy over its source code but that they had subsequently not gained unauthorized access to its identity and access management systems.</p><p>In a statement Okta shared with Engadget, the company confirmed it was notifying customers of a recent security incident, and pointed to a blog post it <a href="https://sec.okta.com/articles/2022/12/okta-code-repositories">published moments ago</a>. &quot;In early December 2022, GitHub alerted Okta about possible suspicious access to Okta code repositories. We have confirmed no customer data was impacted, nor was there any other customer impact. No customer action is required and the Okta service remains fully operational and secure,&quot; an Okta spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;Okta does not rely on the confidentiality of its source code for the security of its services. This event does not impact any other Okta products, and we have been in communication with our customers.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the damage from the GitHub incident appears minimal, the event was still a significant test of Okta. Following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-okta-investigating-attack-lapsus-hacking-group-120541942.html">Lapsus$ breach</a> that saw hackers from the ransomware gang access <a href="https://www.engadget.com/okta-concludes-that-its-lapsus-breach-affected-only-two-customers-095723320.html">two active customer accounts</a>, the company admitted it “made a mistake” in handling the disclosure of that data breach. You may recall it took Okta two months to notify customers of what had happened, and one of the things it promised to do in the aftermath of the incident was “communicate more rapidly with customers.” That pledge was put to the test.</p><p><strong>Update 4:27PM ET</strong>: Added confirmation and comment from Okta.&nbsp;</p>

## Two men allegedly hacked JFK's taxi dispatch system with Russian help

<p>Would you pay a few bucks to skip an interminably long taxi wait line at the airport? That's essentially what Daniel Abayev and Peter Leyman did, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-men-arrested-conspiring-russian-nationals-hack-taxi-dispatch-system-jfk-airport">according to the DOJ</a>, except they focused on taxi drivers. The two men, both from Queens, have been arrested for hacking into JFK's taxi dispatch system with the help of Russian nationals. From September 2019 and September 2021, they charged drivers $10 to jump ahead of JFK's taxi queue. Typically, those cars are sent out depending on their order of arrival.</p><p>&quot;For years, the defendants’ hacking kept honest cab drivers from being able to pick up fares at JFK in the order in which they arrived,&quot; U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. &quot;Now, thanks to this Office’s teamwork with the Port Authority, these defendants are facing serious criminal charges for their alleged cybercrimes.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the DOJ's indictment, both men explored a variety of ways to break into JFK's taxi dispatch system, from bribing people to insert a malware-filled flash drive into a computer, stealing tablets and logging into the system over Wi-Fi. Abayev at one point messaged one of the Russian hackers: “I know that the Pentagon is being hacked[.]. So, can’t we hack the taxi industry[?]”</p><p>The pair used chat threads to communicate with drivers, some of whom also had their $10 fee waived if they could recruit others. Abayev and Leyman have been charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carry a maximum 10-year sentence in prison. Their story follows a spate of Russian cyberattacks over the last ten years, including the infamous hack on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-russian-hackers-2016-election-interference-florida-voter-databases.html">Florida's voter databases in 2016</a>, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-doj-russian-nationals-charged-cybercrime.html">decade-long malware scheme to steal millions</a>, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-14-russian-hackers-windows-flaw-nato.html">theft of NATO data in 2014</a>.</p>

## Twitter appears to be blocking Google Voice numbers from SMS authentication

<p>Twitter appears to have cut off Google Voice numbers from two-factor authentication (2FA). Although it's hardly the first company to block virtual phone numbers from SMS authentication, the change could be connected to CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive moves to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-bots-merger-deal-breach-141116883.html">snuff out bot accounts</a> from the platform.</p><p>The new behavior, reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/12/21/twitter-2fa-google-voice-support/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, appears to block users from using a Google Voice number to authenticate their accounts. (I tried it today, and it rejected my Google Voice number.) Further, users previously authenticated with Google Voice could find themselves locked out of their accounts. Engadget reached out to Google to confirm, and we’ll update the story if we hear back. Twitter no longer has a PR department.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-elon-musk-bought-and-took-over-twitter-180045278.html">buying Twitter and taking over</a> as CEO (a title he now says <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hell-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-but-wont-sell-the-company-025701394.html">he’ll abandon</a> once he finds a successor), Musk has been vocal about vanquishing bots from the platform. Earlier this month, <em>Platformer</em><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-elon-botched-his-war-on-bots">reported</a> the company blocked traffic from 30 mobile carriers worldwide&nbsp;— including networks in Russia, Indonesia, India and Malaysia. The move cut off access for thousands of accounts, including legitimate ones using those wireless carriers for 2FA. Musk accused the carriers of initiating the bogus texts to inflate what Twitter owed them contractually for SMS.</p><p>That report didn’t mention Google Voice, but anyone with a Gmail account can set up a free Google Voice number, making it an easy authentication tool for bots, scammers and spammers. Although it’s tempting to lump this move together with Musk’s seemingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-free-promotion-of-competing-platforms-182712974.html">erratic overhauls</a> since taking over, it’s standard practice for apps ranging from financial institutions to dating apps to bar virtual numbers from 2FA.</p><p>If you set up your Twitter account with Google Voice authentication, you should be able to change the number without contacting support. You can go to Twitter Settings &gt; Security and Account Access &gt; Security &gt; Two-Factor Authentication to remove that number and add your primary carrier line.</p>

<p>After two consecutive failed attempts to re-establish contact, NASA on Wednesday <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-retires-insight-mars-lander-mission-after-years-of-science">officially called</a> an end to its InSight Mars mission. On December 15th, the lander made its final transmission to Earth. NASA said it would make the tough decision to call the mission dead after two failed communication attempts <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9292/nasa-prepares-to-say-farewell-to-insight-spacecraft/?site=insight">earlier this year</a>. The agency will continue to listen for a signal “just in case” but notes the odds of that occurring at this point are “considered unlikely.”</p><p>NASA shared the news of InSight’s impending demise on Monday when it posted the lander’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-mars-insight-lander-rip-194514276.html">final selfie -- taken on April 24th, 2022 -- to Twitter</a>. Since arriving on the martian surface in 2018, InSight has gradually accumulated dust on its solar panels. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-mars-insight-lander-farewell-095620031.html">Earlier this year</a>, NASA predicted the debris would become too thick for the lander to power itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“My power’s really low, so this may be the last image I can send,” InSight’s final tweet reads. “Don’t worry about me though: my time here has been both productive and serene.

Thanks for staying with me.”</p><div id="d5dfcfa6dc7f410ea262c0eac311a47b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">My power’s really low, so this may be the last image I can send.

For more than four years, the lander – its name short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport – collected data about the planet’s deep interior. Using a highly sensitive seismometer, InSight detected 1,319 “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-nasa-insight-marsquakes.html">marsquakes</a>,” including at least one caused by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-insight-lander-meteoroid-impact-mars-192030510.html">meteoroid impact</a>. Using that information, NASA scientists concluded the core of Mars is about half the size of Earth’s. InSight also sent back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-nasa-mars-daily-weather-reports.html">daily weather reports</a> and gave humans our first chance to hear some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-nasa-mars-quake-sounds.html">sounds of the Red Planet</a>.</p><p>“InSight has more than lived up to its name. As a scientist who’s spent a career studying Mars, it’s been a thrill to see what the lander has achieved, thanks to an entire team of people across the globe who helped make this mission a success,” said Laurie Leshin, the director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the unit that managed the mission. “Yes, it’s sad to say goodbye, but InSight’s legacy will live on, informing and inspiring.”</p>

## Canada plans to enforce an ambitious zero-emission vehicle sales quota by 2026

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/canada/"><ins>Canadian</ins></a> government has announced enforceable quotas for zero-emission vehicle sales. By 2026, a fifth of all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the country will need to be zero-emission models, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ev/"><ins>electric</ins></a> or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're moving forward with a regulated sales target that requires at least 20 percent of new vehicles sold by 2026 to be zero emission, increasing that to 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035," Julie Dabrusin, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL0Vudmlyb25tZW50YW5kQ2xpbWF0ZUNoYW5nZS92aWRlb3MvNTYxMTM2MDM4NzgzODk5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNjNhN2Q5Mi0yZGY2LTQ1YzQtYWQ4OS05OGVjOWNjM2Q2YWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYnb43Tg1WlYxyDwhM1zf1bC3iE4ZZS1w23oRRsqNBJ1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEnvironmentandClimateChange%2Fvideos%2F561136038783899"><ins>at a press conference</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's estimated that, between 2026 and 2050, the quotas will lead to Canadians saving almost $34 billion CAD in energy costs. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be equivalent to Ontario's entire emissions for three years. Currently, passenger vehicle emissions account for around 10 percent of Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>While Canada already had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-combustion-engine-car-ban-2035-154623071.html"><ins>zero-emission vehicle sales targets</ins></a>, those aren't yet enforceable nationwide, though some provinces, including Quebec and British Columbia, have their own mandates. The final regulations <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2022/12/let-it-roll-government-of-canada-moves-to-increase-the-supply-of-electric-vehicles-for-canadians.html">should be published in 2023</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/canada-moves-to-mandate-electric-vehicle-sales-starting-in-2025-1.6203469"><em><ins>Canadian Press</ins></em></a>, importers and manufacturers that don't meet the quotas may be penalized under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The country will use credits to track vehicle sales.</p><p>There's still some way to go until Canada can meet the proposed sales targets. In the first six months of 2022, EVs (including plug-in hybrid models) made up 7.2 percent of new car registrations. That was up from 5.2 percent for all of 2021. In British Columbia, almost 15 percent of new vehicles registered between January and June were EVs. In Quebec and Ontario, the proportions were 11.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. In all other provinces, EVs accounted for less than four percent of new vehicle sales.</p><p>Infrastructure improvements should help to increase EV adoption, as should incentives. Dabrusin noted that, by 2027, 85,000 federally funded public chargers will be installed across the country. She added that Canada has long offered rebates on new zero-emission vehicle purchases of up to $5,000 for individuals and up to $10,000 for businesses. More than 180,000 Canadians and businesses in the country have benefitted from those incentives, which have been renewed. The government also plans to invest in EV manufacturing.</p><p>Several automakers have pledged to switch entirely to making EVs and/or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-to-exclusively-sell-zero-emissions-cars-by-2035-164418993.html"><ins>GM</ins></a> setting a deadline of 2035 and Honda aiming to fully make the transition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-ev-platform-2040-sales-183214457.html"><ins>by 2040</ins></a>. Some jurisdictions — such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-gas-powered-vehicle-sale-ban-2035-161505630.html"><ins>California</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-law-ban-gas-powered-car-sales-2035-053554406.html"><ins>New York</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-uk-ban-petrol-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035.html"><ins>UK</ins></a> — will ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.</p><p>“The regulated sales targets for zero emission vehicles announced today will reduce emissions by helping more drivers get behind the wheel of an electric car," Anna Kanduth, a senior research associate at the Canadian Climate Institute, <a href="https://climateinstitute.ca/news/zev-mandate/"><ins>said</ins></a>. "Right now, more than half of Canadians want their next car to be an electric vehicle but they face long wait times, with scarce supply going to provinces like British Columbia and Quebec, where sales mandates are already in place. The federal regulations will help shorten wait times for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids by increasing supply in all provinces and territories."</p>

## Two people charged with hacking Ring security cameras to livestream swattings

<p>In a reminder of smart home security’s dark side, two people hacked Ring security cameras to livestream swattings, according to a Los Angeles grand jury indictment (according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-19/two-charged-with-using-amazon-ring-cameras-in-nationwide-swatting-spree?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>). The pair called in hoax emergencies to authorities and livestreamed the police response on social media in late 2020.</p><p>James Thomas Andrew McCarty, 20, of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Kya Christian Nelson, 21, of Racine, Wisconsin, hacked into Yahoo email accounts to gain access to 12 Ring cameras across nine states in November 2020 (disclaimer: Yahoo is Engadget’s parent company). In one of the incidents, Nelson claimed to be a minor reporting their parents for firing guns while drinking alcohol. When police arrived, the pair used the Ring cameras to taunt the victims and officers while livestreaming — a pattern appearing in several incidents, according to prosecutors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The pair were charged with conspiracy to access computers without authorization, which carries a maximum five-year sentence. Nelson, currently serving time in Kentucky for an unrelated case, was charged with two additional counts of intentionally accessing a computer without authorization and two counts of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory two-year consecutive sentence.</p><p>More than 10 million users own Ring doorbells and home security cameras. Although the smart devices can deter things like robberies and “porch pirates,” Amazon admits to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-law-enforcement-disclosure-224557384.html">providing footage to police</a> without user consent or a court order when it believes someone is in danger. Inexplicably, the tech giant made a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-nation-tv-show-amazon-123003398.html">zany reality series</a> using Ring footage, which didn't exactly quell concerns about the tech’s Orwellian side.</p>

## New York signs onto the Warehouse Worker Protection Act

<p>After clearing both houses of the New York State Legislature <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/jessica-ramos/warehouse-worker-protection-act-passes-both-houses-legislature">in June</a>, Governor Kathy Hochul has finally <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-warehouse-worker-protection-act-law"><ins>signed the Warehouse Worker Protection Act</ins></a>. Broadly modeled after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-warehouse-productivity-quota-law-052141689.html"><ins>AB-701</ins></a>, the landmark labor law California enacted earlier this year, the legislation aims to protect workers from unreasonable productivity quotas. Under the law, New York State will require major warehouse companies, including Amazon, to provide new hires and current employees with documentation detailing their productivity expectations.</p><p>The law also gives workers the right to request their quota at any time, including after their employment ends. Additionally, the legislation prohibits companies from imposing quotas that interfere with a worker’s state-mandated meal and restroom breaks.

<p>Gone are the days when free games equated to ropey puzzle games and knock-off clones of games that had a price tag. These days, courtesy of in-app payments and the ease of offering both a sample of a title alongside its full-fat version, there are actually plenty of great games to play without spending a dime. Following the continued success of titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, the level of quality across mobile, PC and consoles has never been higher.  Put your card away, and consider this your starting point.</p><h2>Genshin Impact</h2><figure><img alt="Genshin Impact Summer Fantasia update" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/26c41a80-fa4b-11ec-bbfd-5128f63c9287" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hoyoverse</div></figure><p>At launch, many of us assumed <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was a tenuous <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> copy with impressive anime graphics and not much else. But this turned out to be a very different game Nintendo’s action RPG, with over 50 characters, at this point, to play as. The world is rich and varied. It’s also a huge accomplishment for a free game that’s found a huge chunk of its audience on smartphones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While battles with foes form a major part of the game, a lot of the joy and satisfaction comes from customizing that army of characters, building up a collection of loot and strengthening them further.  While there is an entire microtransaction system baked into the game, much of the game is playable (and enjoyable) without having to spend a dime. Did we mention it’s totally gorgeous?</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/" id="0f3fea7aab6849b9a9cb183cb27abc77">Play Genshin Impact</a><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><figure><img alt="Ramattra in 'Overwatch 2'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c7a33a20-74d6-11ed-adeb-d092269cc262" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blizzard Entertainment</div></figure><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>still has a steep learning curve.

It’s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal — stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It’s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable than the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you’ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard’s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/" id="9c7d25bf8a0f4ae7a2eed443614f308d">Play Overwatch 2</a><h2>Fortnite Battle Royale</h2><figure><img alt="A character runs into battle in Fortnite as an explosion is set off to the side." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/903d77e0-7642-11ed-ba6f-f30e8c53d471" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Epic Games</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is a social space as much as it is a game.

The core game requires you to either drop in solo or as part of a team and duke it out with up to 149 other players, running between different points of interest to forage for weapons, tactical items and vehicles.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> is reportedly planning more layoffs and another hiring freeze. According to an <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/12/21/tesla-tsla-hiring-freeze-layoffs/"><em><ins>Electrek</ins></em></a> source, the company has halted hiring for the time being and teams will need to lay some people off in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>The extent of the layoffs and hiring freeze are not yet clear. However, Tesla is trying to increase headcount at its manufacturing plants. Reports have <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/12/19/tesla-gigafactory-mexico-to-be-announced-coming-days/"><ins>suggested</ins></a> the company will announce plans to build another Gigafactory in Mexico in the coming days. Tesla does not have a communications department that can be reached for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The automaker's CEO Elon Musk said in June that Tesla would see a 3.5 percent net reduction in headcount over the subsequent few months. A round of layoffs around that time reportedly focused on salaried employees, including hundreds of workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-lays-off-200-autopilot-employees-221601186.html"><ins>from the Autopilot team</ins></a>.</p><p>Even though Tesla delivered a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-q3-2022-manufacturing-figures-191343981.html"><ins>record number of its electric vehicles last quarter</ins></a>, the company's stock price has nosedived by around 65 percent this year and 22 percent this month alone. Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603860632842907648"><ins>blamed</ins></a> the tanking stock on Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p><p>Like other businesses, Tesla has been dealing with an economic slowdown over the last several months.

## How the tech titans crashed head-first into reality

<p>You’ve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_and_naval_vessel_urban_legend">heard the joke</a> about the US Navy vessel and its unidentified opponent that won’t get out of the way. Its Captain, outraged at its refusal, barks into the radio that he’ll sink them if they don’t reconsider, to which the opponent responds “Sir, this is a lighthouse.” I suspect that the truth it speaks to – some people want to steam ahead with what they want, regardless of the material facts – is something everyone can recognize. And it’s also true that the ones who are most convinced of their <em>rightness</em> are the ones who don’t notice the proverbial lighthouses looming on the horizon.</p><p>I think it’s a mindset that Silicon Valley types train themselves into because it’s part of the myth-making that takes place there. Star innovators who defied common opinion, and logic, to forge their own path and make a fortune from something everyone else had missed. It’s rarely true, but it’s a useful narrative to cling to, and it’s easier to portray yourself as swimming alone against a tide of hostility (or indifference), especially if you interpret valid criticism as obstinate censure. It’s an attitude that’ll get you far, for sure, but can often leave you open to calamities that others might have avoided.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Take Meta, which bragged back in October that it had <del>invested</del> blown <em>$10 billion</em> on its <del>mediocre VR environments</del> Metaverse ambitions. When the company said that its cutesy avatars were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-avatars-metaverse-legs-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-190937062.html">getting legs</a> (the must-have accessory for any digital avatar in 2022) there was scoffing. The scoffing got louder when it turns out that the leg animations used in the demo were, in fact, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-vr-legs-video-mocap-105007370.html">faked</a>. $10 billion for <em>that</em>, in this economy? Either VR feature development really is more expensive than curing world hunger, or Mark Zuckerberg’s <em>being had</em>.</p><p>The narrative, intentionally or otherwise, is that Zuckerberg is leading a spirited, one-man quest to own whatever the internet will evolve into. I’ll admit, it’s not the dumbest move, given that while Facebook remains massively profitable, its long-term future remains uncertain. It’s just a shame that his bet seems to be a perpetually-sunny, cel-shaded version of the world from <em>Neuromancer</em> rather than anything better. And, to be honest, all of the non-tech people I know have looked at VR demos and politely decided that they’d much rather stick with anything else.</p><div id="6049083a8fcb464bad1187fcfb3a8766"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sci-Fi Author: In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale<br /><br />Tech Company: At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don't Create The Torment Nexus</p>— Alex Blechman (@AlexBlechman) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBlechman/status/1457842724128833538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Part of this is because so many tech leaders are in their post-imperial phase, beheading anyone who dares suggest the kingdom is in ruins. It means the information handed to dear leaders is scrubbed-free of anything that could anger them, thinning their already thin skin. (Elon Musk has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fired-employees-called-out-elon-musk-063109091.html">knack for firing anyone who disagrees with him</a>, even if he’s been proven wrong.) Worse, is that as they surround themselves with sycophants, they become increasingly unaware of their own blind spots.</p><p>For instance, we’re expected to hit a deep recession as energy and food prices continue to leap up. People are looking for ways to save money, but still want to hook onto whatever exciting fad is coming around the corner. Instead of spending $10 billion on… <em>legs</em>, why didn’t Meta use half of that money to reduce the barriers of entry to would-be VR users? $5 billion could have easily been used to discount the price of a Quest 2 to between $99 and $199 for several million people. Yes, you’d be forcing things a little, but imagine how many people would buy <em>Beat Saber</em> in the run-up to the holidays. Sadly, it’s hard to care about the material concerns of normal people when the closest thing you’ve got to a nearby normal person is (Facebook's President of Global Affairs) Nick Clegg leashed to your gatepost, attacking any would-be visitors and biting the mailman.</p><p>Then there’s Sam Bankman-Fried (and his cohort), who at the time of writing has<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-sec-regulator-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-defrauding-investors-113127838.html"> just been arrested</a> for all of the things he’s done. Now, I have to admit, events are moving so fast that it’s hard to come up with anything pithy about SBF, FTX, Alameda and everything else. But it already looks like we’re going to have to endure at least two competing prestige miniseries about All Of This. It’s just a shame that after the freewheeling cons of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-dropout-disney-hulu-star-amanda-seyfried-170013308.html">Theranos</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wecrashed-wework-series-apple-tv-plus-jared-leto-anne-hathaway-223029989.html">WeWork</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-21-uber-future-travis-kalanick-resignation.html">Uber</a>, we’re not learning any of our lessons and are, instead, enabling these crooks.</p><p>Now, I could repeat much of what’s already been written about crypto this year, but I don’t think there would be much point. Between you and me, I think that the crypto world is going to fall into terminal decline in the not-too distant future. There are only so many major exchanges that can collapse, wiping out people’s cash, before would-be converts start deciding that less risky ventures are for them. And without the constant supply of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">new fools</a>, the bloodbath of people trying to turn their digital fortunes into real ones will crater Bitcoin’s value.</p><p>What I’d rather talk about is the culture that enabled Bankman-Fried to garner so much public attention as he did. And that means talking about the media, which gave him so much space and praise as to prematurely sanctify an unreliable, or untrustworthy, figure. Was he enabled and feted by an industry that’s desperate to find and groom future superstars? It makes sense, given you need celebrities to sell print editions, and be keynote speakers at those live events which apparently generate the bulk of the cash those publications rake in.</p><p>Since there’s nobody <em>else</em> who fits into the mold of that fictional US Navy captain, I’d like to talk about <em>my</em> plans for 2023. I’ve decided to become a Tesla mechanic, since so many of those cars seem to need mechanical repair after they’ve left the factory. Now, I don’t know anything about electronics, engineering, automotive technology, wiring repair, aerodynamics, software design, LIDAR, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-data-for-54-million-users-leaked-online-095040426.html">autonomous systems</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-less-safe-under-elon-musk-yoel-roth-011449138.html">safety legislation</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-stops-enforcing-covid-19-misinformation-policy-145445252.html">wheel dynamics</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-brussels-office-eu-stricter-content-rules-154526822.html">power efficiency</a>, but I reckon it’s both really easy, and bound to be super profitable.</p><div id="70630e170e7e49c28fbe06e24a7c1e76"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">News about arbitrary suspension of journalists on Twitter is worrying.

<p>Ukraine will receive an additional 10,000-plus Starlink satellite dishes from Elon Musk's SpaceX to help provide internet amid Russian attacks on communications infrastructure, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-20/ukraine-to-get-thousands-more-starlink-antennas-minister-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-spacex-keep-funding-ukraine-starlink-satellite-internet-075616416.html">Financial issues</a> around the terminals have reportedly been resolved, with several European countries stepping up to share the costs, according to Ukraine's deputy prime minister Mykhailo Federov.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;SpaceX and Musk quickly react to problems and help us,” Federov told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Musk assured us he will continue to support Ukraine. When we had a powerful blackout, I messaged him on that day and he momentarily reacted and has already delivered some steps. He understands the situation.&quot; However, Ukraine will need to find additional funds by spring of next year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 10,000 new terminals add to the 22,000 already received, and will be used to &quot;stabilize connections for critical situations,&quot; according to Federov.  &quot;There is no alternative to satellite connections,&quot; he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in the fall, SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-spacex-keep-funding-ukraine-starlink-satellite-internet-075616416.html">asked</a> the US Department of Defense to take over payments related to Starlink. &quot;We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,&quot; the company said. Elon Musk backtracked on that decision, however, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1580802376973230080">writing on Twitter</a> that SpaceX would &quot;keep funding [the] Ukraine [government] for free&quot; even though Starlink is still losing money. It was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-price-hike-in-ukraine-144623737.html">reported in November</a> that the price of a Starlink terminal had doubled in Ukraine, from around $385 to $700. However, the monthly rate for data has dropped from $100 since the war started in February down to $75.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online multiplayer has become part and parcel with many video games these days, but finding something you can play on the couch with a loved one has gotten tougher. If you’re looking for some cooperative fun, though, we can help. Below are 25 of the best couch co-op games we’ve played across the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Note that we’re focusing on genuine co-op experiences, not games that have local multiplayer but aren’t truly cooperative in practice. (So, no Mario Kart or Jackbox.) Even still, our list encompasses everything from platformers and puzzlers to RPGs and arcade shooters.</p><h2>Super Mario 3D World</h2><figure><img alt="Super Mario 3D World for the Nintendo Switch." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3a0b8950-718f-11ed-bf7f-a502df226bac" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>You know the broad strokes of any Super Mario<em>&nbsp;</em>game by now.

You and up to three buddies share lives but are scored on your individual performance, with the leader at the end of each level getting a literal crown placed atop their head. This makes for a sort of competitive co-op mode, one in which a particularly devious “teammate” could straight-up grab you and chuck you off a cliff in an attempt to secure their high score. The adventure only has to be as spicy as you and your partners want it to be, though; if you aren’t playing with a group of sickos, 3D World should be an exciting update to a familiar Mario<em>&nbsp;</em>formula.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEpDWktUUVc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaC9JEIDfIyidCUTSdbsGOKA0S1BMRlG_97Lc50fDuiX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08JCZKTQW">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/82771">17 hours</a></p><h2>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</h2><figure><img alt="Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for the Nintendo Switch." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/5755c9b0-7191-11ed-a7df-dee682f36d64" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Like most Donkey Kong Country games, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Eb25rZXktS29uZy1Db3VudHJ5LVRyb3BpY2FsLUZyZWV6ZS1OaW50ZW5kby9kcC9CMDdDSzJaR1FCP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATWUpMErwPtR3sp-wRZaQZwfehvQzhQEqlLE2o0aXNKo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDonkey-Kong-Country-Tropical-Freeze-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB07CK2ZGQB%3Fth%3D1">Tropical Freeze</a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a 2D platformer that’s both structurally straightforward and aesthetically gorgeous.

But even ignoring all of that, Clubhouse Games<em>&nbsp;</em>is a fun, chill time, much like busting out a favorite board game.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DbHViaG91c2UtR2FtZXMtNTEtV29ybGR3aWRlLUNsYXNzaWNzL2RwL0IwODZaOUQzVEQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQyeNDBl1TVdehMBJPE4Tb8AVrmJAXAsc37fdIiZ8APl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FClubhouse-Games-51-Worldwide-Classics%2Fdp%2FB086Z9D3TD">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/76853">18 hours</a></p><h2>BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!</h2><figure><img alt="BOXBOY! + BOXGIRL! for the Nintendo Switch." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/76303c70-7192-11ed-9bfb-372699ed4f68" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CT1hCT1ktcGx1cy1CT1hHSVJML2RwL0IwN1FaUjRQRlQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfsdT-cxrpbd_jfta_XSYTAcGeROzX-7qJXveSRamJwR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBOXBOY-plus-BOXGIRL%2Fdp%2FB07QZR4PFT">BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!</a><em>&nbsp;</em>may not look like much, but this minimalist puzzler from Kirby makers HAL Laboratory has the kind of simple pleasure and regularly inventive design you’d expect from a Nintendo-published game. In its two-player campaign, you play as Qbby and Qucy, two walking boxes with the ability to grow additional boxes out of their heads. Your goal is to get from point A to point B, using those boxes to cross gaps and navigate various obstacles along the way.</p><p>The catch is that you can only create a certain amount of boxes at a time, so you and your partner often have to think outside the box (sorry) to find a safe way past. You’ll start off making basic bridges, but the bite-sized levels quickly build on themselves with a stream of new ideas. Eventually, you’ll find yourself using boxes as makeshift grappling hooks, shovels, laser-blocking shields and more, all in ways that quickly make sense. Simply beating the game isn’t that difficult, but collecting the tricky-to-reach crowns tucked away in each stage brings a greater challenge for those who want it.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CT1hCT1ktcGx1cy1CT1hHSVJML2RwL0IwN1FaUjRQRlQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfsdT-cxrpbd_jfta_XSYTAcGeROzX-7qJXveSRamJwR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBOXBOY-plus-BOXGIRL%2Fdp%2FB07QZR4PFT">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/66122">11 hours</a></p><h2>It Takes Two</h2><figure><img alt="The video game It Takes Two." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/656b3af0-71bc-11ed-bdde-f32810d222be" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>The 3D platformer <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UYWtlcy1Ud28tTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwQkRURjNOSzQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARxB8gfb3-R63gbl7436DMW_-mDgD8g_6dU4x0dcHxrm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTakes-Two-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0BDTF3NK4">It Takes Two</a> is one of the few full-scale, narrative-driven games that’s exclusively designed to be played in co-op. As such, it takes care to avoid the trappings of many co-op experiences: It rarely asks both players to do the same thing at the same time, and thus it rarely makes one person carry all the weight. It constantly throws new concepts at you, and while some levels can drag a bit, its bouncy movement <em>feels good</em> throughout.</p><p>Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html">saccharine yet oddly dark</a> story isn’t as satisfying: Few games make divorce seem like a happy ending as much as this one, and you’ll probably never want to hear the words “Dr. Hakim” again by the time you’re done. But if you can ignore the dialogue, It Takes Two delights more than it doesn’t.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvSXQtVGFrZXMtVHdvLzE3NjA1OTA5MzMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASQNmWtDKRuEsZpTa2z10i3arsx1QmOAV9-3eIHSxOc5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FIt-Takes-Two%2F1760590933">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvSXQtVGFrZXMtVHdvLzQ3NzkzOTg0OCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYtTxa-K9Abop5MPdirB4yZqmQXMnnY6b7TjEnYF3ADR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FIt-Takes-Two%2F477939848">PS4 &amp; PS5</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9pdC10YWtlcy10d28tZGlnaXRhbC12ZXJzaW9uLzlOWFZDMDQ4MlFTNS8wMDEwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbhoBqYAk5pIvVC3HbXFPT2Bcp7hc2hGQ3PxjkeMRzvl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fit-takes-two-digital-version%2F9NXVC0482QS5%2F0010">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UYWtlcy1Ud28tUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNC9kcC9CMEI0UlJTUkNMP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAefQy4aEaXdwl5OJbUxi_HhKzD8AyhH2WZnfWYYqhyI-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTakes-Two-PlayStation-4%2Fdp%2FB0B4RRSRCL%3Fth%3D1">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/80199">14 hours</a></p><h2>Portal 2</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Portal 2." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c9f154a0-71bc-11ed-b25f-462762db7da1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>The first-person puzzler <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BvcnRhbC1jb21wYW5pb24tY29sbGVjdGlvbi1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbyuwf18S8G35dXkhmVXil9KJvSx9bcOv-XWdXTXOBeO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fportal-companion-collection-switch%2F">Portal 2</a> launched more than 11 years ago, but it recently received new life with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/portal-companion-collection-nintendo-switch-out-today-141017922.html">a Switch rerelease</a>.

The hand-drawn animation style and bouncy soundtrack are both great, and most set pieces convey the “rage” part of the title effectively.

Like most Lego games, it’s dead simple to play – collect the things, bop the bad guys – but that makes it something just about anyone can pick up and enjoy. The best thing it has going for it is its sense of humor, as its abbreviated remakes of each film are loaded with cutesy gags and in-jokes. (One favorite: wandering around <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloud_City">Cloud City</a> and finding the room where Lando Calrissian keeps his hoard of capes – and a heroic portrait of himself.)</p><p>There’s an absurd amount of side quests and collectibles beyond the narrative bits, but most of those are repetitive, and Skywalker Saga’s systems, while fun, aren’t meaty enough to make optional content all that interesting. Still, if you stick to the main stuff, you should find Skywalker Saga to be a good-natured love letter to some inherently goofy films.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2xlZ28tc3Rhci13YXJzLXRoZS1za3l3YWxrZXItc2FnYS8yMDI2MzIuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaMXp53vUfc8Z_c7zWV6cLGBBcjYUVAyW_dm7NNjj2hP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fproducts%2Flego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga%2F202632.html">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvTEVHTy1TdGFyLVdhcnMtVGhlLVNreXdhbGtlci1TYWdhLVBsYXlTdGF0aW9uLTQvMjE3MjE5Njk4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVFa8MzC5mtsSCVVN30_5HreJ1IEjx02ILnechX2dnE2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-PlayStation-4%2F217219698">PS4</a> &amp; <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvTEVHTy1TdGFyLVdhcnMtVGhlLVNreXdhbGtlci1TYWdhLVBsYXlTdGF0aW9uLTUvMzU1NzA2ODM2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcSs1rIe8cPtck52y3hi90BOmMxtFYlXpuy_ZCmBtlv4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-PlayStation-5%2F355706836">PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9sZWdvLXN0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtc2t5d2Fsa2VyLXNhZ2EvOU5KTjFNQzFYNUZLIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfsL90xeHdAdMjq2K37J5JofXeNah2MKofGjZZa69k6V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Flego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga%2F9NJN1MC1X5FK">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9sZWdvLXN0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtc2t5d2Fsa2VyLXNhZ2EiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcCIoBpK76kOOYNrNB3zFovIdoa5OzTAMJJ-fajurYbr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Flego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/68261">40 hours</a></p><h2>Stardew Valley</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Stardew Valley." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/628260f0-71be-11ed-bed7-b8c4c2c3c06d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ConcernedApe</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdGFyZGV3LVZhbGxleS9kcC9CMDc2VEs0TTk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQtSX-fsgT5zcV_cbF6L46V1howxqOvDrObBA7OnFhAM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStardew-Valley%2Fdp%2FB076TK4M96">Stardew Valley</a> has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-20-million-copies-sold-184832175.html">exploded in popularity</a> since launching back in 2016, and it’s easy to see why: More than just a laid-back farming sim a la Harvest Moon, it’s an escape, an engrossing alternate life where you’re allowed to putter around your farm, mosey through town, and take life slow, free from the burdens of aggression and competition. You and a friend can share a farm and divide up tasks in co-op, but the game isn’t fussy; if one of you would rather fish, explore the beach or simply sit around your house, it’s okay to do your thing. And if you’d rather ruthlessly optimize your land for profits, that’s an option, too.

It has loads of dialogue, deep character customization, and challenging turn-based combat (by default, at least). It’s not a game you’d play casually – a playthrough can last well over 100 hours, and it’s more than willing to throw a mountain of mechanics at you, regardless of whether you’re able to keep up.</p><p>If you want to dig into something dense, though, Divinity’s complexities are ultimately rewarding, and its world is wonderfully reactive. Its approach to co-op is also unusually thoughtful: You and a partner can go through the entire campaign locally, but you’re distinct characters, and neither of you <em>have</em> to follow the other’s lead. Indeed, part of the fun is in the ways your “buddy” could undermine your adventure, taking up a quest with contradictory aims or killing an important NPC. It asks: What’d happen if your RPG party members behaved like actual people? The answer: a mess, potentially, but a thrilling one. Just note that local multiplayer is unavailable on the Switch version of the game.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3526-CUSA12611_00-ORIGINALSIN2DE01">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9kaXZpbml0eS1vcmlnaW5hbC1zaW4tMi1kZWZpbml0aXZlLWVkaXRpb24vYnc4cHZsNGNqMnE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeLo_u1pbswQiQsoa52hax9V-T9obfdsnmKQVRQLDDLS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fdivinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition%2Fbw8pvl4cj2q6">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2RpdmluaXR5X29yaWdpbmFsX3Npbl8yIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY7_uxpi6MAlfDjZZArpFTJxsr55PfrN3Djf8-2v1rSe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdivinity_original_sin_2">PC</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EaXZpbml0eS1PcmlnaW5hbC1TaW4tMi1EZWZpbml0aXZlLUVkaXRpb24vZHAvQjA3WVFMS0RaWD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kMy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAS8i34129nY42hl4UUe1cq8tCG8OnNOAV6AEsjOUVhWw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDivinity-Original-Sin-2-Definitive-Edition%2Fdp%2FB07YQLKDZX">Switch</a> (no local co-op)<br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/39525">100 hours</a></p><h2>Untitled Goose Game</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Untitled Goose Game." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3e137c30-71bf-11ed-b9f7-ce8686c8d44f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbnRpdGxlZC1Hb29zZS1HYW1lL2RwL0IwN1lRTDgyN0Y_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfb-4tQ7BTsFaCT7N8I3m2kgaOUD-V55W00olBqMvBaW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUntitled-Goose-Game%2Fdp%2FB07YQL827F">Untitled Goose Game</a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a simple puzzle/stealth game that gets a lot of mileage out of its premise: You are a goose, and your only goal in life is to aggravate the residents of a little English village.

You play as a sprightly dog who becomes that wielder. What follows is a cozy adventure in the vein of Zelda, but with a twist: You can use the brush to paint over the environment, at any point, anywhere you want, in various colors and patterns. This turns a somewhat familiar game into something of a digital coloring book, one that remembers your markings in time as you go along. Chicory is exceedingly gentle and never suggests you’re <em>doing it wrong</em>, so if you want to spend 45 minutes ignoring the story and painting trees purple, you can. There are tons of accessibility options on top of that.</p><p>In co-op, player one still controls the pace of progression, but player two gets another brush with all the same abilities. On top of giving a second set of hands to deal with the game’s various puzzles and boss encounters, this lets you both create a shared impression on the world, like two kids sharing crayons on a children’s menu. The narrative gets heavier than the cutesy art style suggests, exploring themes of self-doubt, impostor syndrome and other struggles that can come with creative work. But it’s refreshingly earnest throughout. If you’re looking for a warm, caring, but still goofy co-op experience, Chicory is worth a shot.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGljb3J5LUEtQ29sb3JmdWwtVGFsZS9kcC9CMDlOV1ROTlk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARcmyKd97RUpKVSzFgSnfFmKM4_zDIOy-a4kux9hd_LD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChicory-A-Colorful-Tale%2Fdp%2FB09NWTNNY6">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvY2hpY29yeS1hLWNvbG9yZnVsLXRhbGUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWRpduJJOPc4ts_uAtkpDDX_7nLvvpb4qIzveBmGF34a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fchicory-a-colorful-tale%2F">PS4 &amp; PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9jaGljb3J5LWEtY29sb3JmdWwtdGFsZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYnNhMgPI_0NnBqBncm4HAfMHL7ySbeM-2DAUYwgzIIo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fchicory-a-colorful-tale">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71074">14 hours</a></p><h2>Spiritfarer</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Spiritfarer." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2a5868d0-71c0-11ed-b5ef-1665058f693f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Thunder Lotus Games</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlyaXRmYXJlci9kcC9CMDhMNkY2M0ZTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7JfhNC3jBkZ1E-lEScsHbG17URZgZY3bDXWx2F05d7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpiritfarer%2Fdp%2FB08L6F63FS">Spiritfarer</a> is a management sim not unlike Animal Crossing, but with some light platforming elements. Like Chicory, it’s generally relaxed, sincere and low-stakes, but occasionally devastating in the way it puts a friendly face on adult themes. Here, you play as Stella, a young woman who becomes tasked with ferrying freshly deceased souls into the afterlife. This mostly involves exploring the seas on a big boat, doing quests and gathering and crafting resources to make passing on more comfortable for the many characters you get to know. Player two joins in as Stella’s pet cat, Daffodil, who can’t trigger quests but can otherwise help with platforming and management tasks.</p><p>Spiritfarer’s sim elements can sometimes feel monotonous, and the way the game addresses death head-on can be sad, but it stands out for being as much about love and care as sorrow. If you and your partner are into management sims and aren’t afraid of shedding a tear or two, there’s beauty to be found here.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlyaXRmYXJlci9kcC9CMDhMNkY2M0ZTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7JfhNC3jBkZ1E-lEScsHbG17URZgZY3bDXWx2F05d7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpiritfarer%2Fdp%2FB08L6F63FS">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2388-CUSA20182_00-0000000000000000">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zcGlyaXRmYXJlci1mYXJld2VsbC1lZGl0aW9uLzluZzVsNThmZDN4NSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAapsRFzViGJHO1BwjQnfeNqH4epOSaLzs4ZJydlpuhqU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fspiritfarer-farewell-edition%2F9ng5l58fd3x5">Xbox</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3NwaXJpdGZhcmVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfOnqZLEeml1BWoyGzVHpqjSWnEMdWQtx2vFII-O-6S3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fspiritfarer">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/68189">33 hours</a></p><h2>Overcooked!

In theory, this is as simple as grabbing the right ingredients, preparing them properly, then sending the finished plate off on time. But as the orders keep piling up and parts of the levels start to conspire against you, your ability to scramble and communicate under pressure becomes increasingly put to the test. There’s a non-zero chance your partner will call you an “<a href="https://youtu.be/PV3_UHG73oQ">idiot sandwich</a>” by the time you’re done.</p><p>With its adorable looks, Overcooked! knows what it’s doing, but fighting through the anxiety of its most chaotic levels brings a particularly comical sense of accomplishment. The All You Can Eat edition here includes the original Overcooked!, the (superior) sequel Overcooked 2!, and all their DLC. It also adds an “assist mode” that lets you ease up the timers on each order, which, yes, <em>kind of</em> defeats the point of the game, but also might be necessary if you and your friends start screaming at each other over cartoon fish chopping.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PdmVyY29va2VkLUFsbC1Zb3UtQ2FuLUVhdC9kcC9CMDkxUVJZSFBDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUmkjuHkHt_Ih48mpu02ccEzuQji8EMKaq6T0k9csatY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOvercooked-All-You-Can-Eat%2Fdp%2FB091QRYHPC">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10000899/">PS4 &amp; PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9vdmVyY29va2VkLWFsbC15b3UtY2FuLWVhdC85cHAybmN6NzJjNzkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWdNb_D5VVGvC12hlCgmfRAyt_Nw6YWR9Na_QHAw69xj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fovercooked-all-you-can-eat%2F9pp2ncz72c79">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243830/Overcooked_All_You_Can_Eat/">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/89610">41 hours</a></p><h2>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/d98ca9c0-71bf-11ed-bdff-c1644c0e5203" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2xvdmVyc19pbl9hX2Rhbmdlcm91c19zcGFjZXRpbWUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ6dVfdjCntl_5ilykPVJLYjOscLApQ1UdA1teYdvFKs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flovers_in_a_dangerous_spacetime">Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a vibrant space shooter in which you and up to three partners must collectively navigate a chunky battleship through levels packed with baddies and other obstacles. There are eight panels for controlling the ship’s engine, shields and various weapons, but each player can only man one station at a time, so you have no choice but to scramble and communicate to keep your shared body alive for as long as possible.

(It’s no wonder there’s now a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-the-cuphead-show-release-date-trailer-155529331.html">TV show</a> based on the game.) Somehow, the story, about a pair of talking cups who make a deal with the Devil, fits the art style like a glove.</p><p>Actually playing Cuphead, meanwhile, is an exercise in punishment. It is <em>brutally</em> difficult, with several intense boss fights that demand serious concentration. Playing it in co-op makes it even tougher, as those bosses gain more health, and having two characters jump around can make the action more chaotic. That said, the challenge is not cheap, and overcoming each fight brings the expected wave of catharsis. If you have a bit of a masochistic streak, it’s worth a go. A recent <a href="https://cupheadgame.com/dlc.html">DLC expansion</a> only adds to the beautiful mayhem.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2N1cGhlYWQvMTk5OTY5Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUsFiu2_acaJaataC2hBQcXiEeUlk4Spc8Zz4miNhSHo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fproducts%2Fcuphead%2F199969.html">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8062-CUSA20499_00-CUPHEAD000000000">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jdXBoZWFkLzlOSlJYNzFNNVg5UC8wMDEwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVIohCycshhP5001Fty6IQv_X0OzdioBWCeWv0mzsN_Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcuphead%2F9NJRX71M5X9P%2F0010">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2N1cGhlYWQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX8-XNHd0S8T7nipg0MHk9ZEd5EWTiFKIQcx6GdCZLSl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fcuphead">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/21680">15 hours</a></p><h2>Spelunky + Spelunky 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/ada366e0-71c0-11ed-bcdb-ce9daa37b6c1" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239350/Spelunky/">Spelunky</a> helped popularize the trend of modern 2D platformers with roguelike elements – i.e., games where you mostly start from scratch upon death. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/">Spelunky 2</a>, released about a decade later in 2020, essentially polishes the original game’s formula.</p><p>Like Cuphead, neither of these games is for the faint of heart. Traversing their caves while avoiding the many death traps within is like descending into cartoon Hell. But again, it’s a (mostly) fair and legible challenge, if you can stay patient. The procedurally generated levels keep exploration from feeling totally rigid, and the frankness and pure speed with which death can hit you gives everything a morbid sense of humor. Couch co-op can feel somewhat unnatural at times – everyone has to stick near player one to stay on camera – but having a partner or three to revive you is a relief, provided you don’t accidentally blow each other up first.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3NlYXJjaC8_cT1zcGVsdW5reSZwPTEmY2F0PWFsbCZzb3J0PWRmIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWVpwDzYBpNFlgPuB3ZuvX4d2847vzL6Q9fbyVM8WRU-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dspelunky%26p%3D1%26cat%3Dall%26sort%3Ddf">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/spelunky">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zcGVsdW5reS0yLzlQTTg1UUs2QzEzSC8wMDEwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQRnq-St9oa4XRg8fKWkh-k5mL1xeXiCthlCIatl2xMT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fspelunky-2%2F9PM85QK6C13H%2F0010">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=spelunky">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/89610?q=spelunky">104 hours</a></p><h2>Ikaruga</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Ikaruga." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/23f94940-71c1-11ed-95fe-1932eebf541f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Treasure</div></figure><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/253750/Ikaruga/">Ikaruga</a> is more than two decades old at this point, but it remains a crown jewel among shoot ‘em ups.

It’s probably not enough to convince the roguelike-averse to hop aboard, but Wizard of Legend<em>&nbsp;</em>is a good <em>one of those</em> all the same.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaXphcmQtb2YtTGVnZW5kL2RwL0IwN0Q3MlIyMTM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT9L7rxhcXTRtk1MmGwS6ZiFo5KaZN2QFCGBK3G7i8TG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWizard-of-Legend%2Fdp%2FB07D72R213">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3864-CUSA10927_00-WIZARDOFLEGENDUS">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS93aXphcmQtb2YtbGVnZW5kL0M0MEhMN0RGSFdDWCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAATKHX3yys9cr4fXV0WH6npGgrAzaK2j3I6zOK6O7R26r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fwizard-of-legend%2FC40HL7DFHWCX">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3dpemFyZF9vZl9sZWdlbmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXPHXG_yN1FoqJ38pB5fIizIcdsVuMZ98vuyHUarWvkA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwizard_of_legend">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/26294">16 hours</a></p><h2>Assault Android Cactus</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Assault Android Cactus." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/cd755900-71c1-11ed-bf66-2ef049c5b345" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Witch Beam</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hc3NhdWx0LWFuZHJvaWQtY2FjdHVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUJsVu3mSF1kYBpN7Sa7dZwrrO9jv_dSo422mwo7NFAZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fassault-android-cactus">Assault Android Cactus</a> is an especially intense twin-stick shooter. You and up to three friends play as little androids charged with surviving hordes of robot baddies on a space freighter. (The tone is much more campy than gritty, thankfully.) Its tension derives from the fact that each android runs on a continuously depleting battery; if emptied, it’s game over. Since you can only replenish that battery by defeating waves of enemies, it behooves you to play aggressively and keep moving. The nonstop rush of baddies, gunfire and power-ups Cactus throws at you is exhilarating, and it’s heightened by quick-burst levels that rarely sit still. Plus, while this isn’t an easy game, it’s far from unfair, with most of the challenge coming from chasing high scores.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2Fzc2F1bHQtYW5kcm9pZC1jYWN0dXMtcGx1cy1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZNMF4JIwZ_-N8QhRAQdli4VNfd_4cl1Ru-2W9EEacy4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fassault-android-cactus-plus-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1520-CUSA03161_00-CACTUS0000000001">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9hc3NhdWx0LWFuZHJvaWQtY2FjdHVzL2JzYnRqbTQzMHZ2ciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVmvNDghHcj5PsnXOZAeBg-2hHFeJ6lskcK9JLn0SBKe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fassault-android-cactus%2Fbsbtjm430vvr">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hc3NhdWx0LWFuZHJvaWQtY2FjdHVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMWE1OGRjYS1jYWFiLTRkNDMtYTc1NC04MDNiNmU4NTAxZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUJsVu3mSF1kYBpN7Sa7dZwrrO9jv_dSo422mwo7NFAZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fassault-android-cactus">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/20968">6 hours</a></p><h2>Wilmot's Warehouse</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Wilmot's Warehouse." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f2602f10-71c1-11ed-bf6f-b0b198062a53" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Finji</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS93aWxtb3RzLXdhcmVob3VzZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYZnkyzzUl_pspK7CaRfJD2P33ZMVwEyeiO-aiytXytV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwilmots-warehouse">Wilmot’s Warehouse</a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a clever little game about organizing an ever-growing warehouse. At the start of each level, you get a batch of colorful boxes, which you must gather and tuck away on a timer. Exactly <em>how</em> you organize them is up to you. When the timer ends, customers will start requesting certain products within the warehouse, and the challenge becomes retrieving the corresponding boxes as quickly as possible.</p><p>The game, then, is coming up with a system that will let your specific brain remember where everything is and adapt to new box types as they roll in. There’s a frenzy to completing orders, and a dark undercurrent to the idea of two warehouse workers being scored as they fulfill this many orders and strive this hard for efficiency. (The latter is made particularly clear in the game’s sudden ending.) In the abstract, though, Wilmot’s Warehouse makes a soothing game out of our unending desire to create order from chaos.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3dpbG1vdHMtd2FyZWhvdXNlLXN3aXRjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYeLKzhB_iYOGEPh4CFeJI_q1fIdLhIP5SvW6u1PZ6Wz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fwilmots-warehouse-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0406-CUSA25302_00-8397299735300170">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS93aWxtb3RzLXdhcmVob3VzZS85bmxrams0bTF2cWsiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMxYTU4ZGNhLWNhYWItNGQ0My1hNzU0LTgwM2I2ZTg1MDFmOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARgIFpCptjq061u81XVP3Ymylzd9yhAEQG1E7LSpOjCJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fwilmots-warehouse%2F9nlkjk4m1vqk">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS93aWxtb3RzLXdhcmVob3VzZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYZnkyzzUl_pspK7CaRfJD2P33ZMVwEyeiO-aiytXytV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwilmots-warehouse">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/50395">8 hours</a></p><h2>Escape Academy</h2><figure><img alt="The video game Escape Academy." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/21449410-71c2-11ed-97f1-822fb9a0a859" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">iam8bit</div></figure><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9lc2NhcGUtYWNhZGVteSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhNThkY2EtY2FhYi00ZDQzLWE3NTQtODAzYjZlODUwMWY4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbkFnSUT5TWMDnm3YHV21J1BN1pjOuYQqPXvSpRvGz63&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fescape-academy">Escape Academy</a> is, in essence, a series of digital escape rooms.

The puzzles themselves are varied, but maybe a touch too easy, and the overarching narrative is (mostly) just kind of there.

<p>Twitter news whiplash continues. Elon Musk has said he’ll <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hell-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-but-wont-sell-the-company-025701394.html">step down as CEO </a>of Twitter once he’s found a suitable replacement. You might remember Musk ran a poll at the weekend asking if he should leave the role, and the Twitter-using public overwhelmingly told him, well, yes. There was no immediate response to the results of the poll, but by late Tuesday, after suggesting he might change it so only paying users could vote, he seems to be <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1605372724800393216%7Ctwgr%5Ecac68da74c3537aaafb28b92e94c1d34ec2b9f50%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Felon-musk-says-hell-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-but-wont-sell-the-company-025701394.html"><ins>acting on the result.</ins></a> According to his tweet, Musk plans to stay on and run the software and server teams.</p><p>The job as Twitter CEO will be viewed by many as a poisoned chalice. Roughly 70 percent of the staff have either been laid off or quit, hate speech and trolls have thrived and many advertisers have dropped or reduced their advertising spending.

## Virgin Orbit gets the licenses it needs for the UK's first space launch

<p>Virgin Orbit is set to make the first ever space flight from UK soil, after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/news/uk-space-regulator-issues-virgin-orbit-licences-ahead-of-uk-launch/">approved</a> a &quot;historic&quot; first launch license from <a href="https://spaceportcornwall.com/becoming-the-uks-first-licensed-spaceport-the-next-step-on-the-road-to-net-zero/">Spaceport Cornwell</a>. With that in hand, the company plans to launch nine satellites from a LauncherOne rocket aboard its &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; Boeing 747 aircraft in January next year.&nbsp;</p><p>Virgin Orbit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-16-virgin-orbit-uk-spaceport-launcherone-cosmic-girl.html">first announced plans</a> to launch from a site at Cornwall Airport Newquay four years ago, so the launch has been many years in the making. The first flight was originally scheduled in for mid-December, but was postponed due to technical issues and the lack of a license.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite those concerns, the CAA said the license was issued within 15 months, &quot;putting the UK framework on a competitive footing with international space regulators.&quot; The regulator added it took &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; to mitigate safety risks. Spaceport Cornwall, meanwhile, received its launch certification <a href="https://spaceportcornwall.com/becoming-the-uks-first-licensed-spaceport-the-next-step-on-the-road-to-net-zero/">last month</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the launch license, Virgin Orbit received a range control license that allows it to issue warning notices and monitor the progress of missions. &quot;Receiving range and launch licenses takes us one step closer to the first satellite launch take-off from UK soil,&quot; said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. &quot;We are progressing towards the first launch from Cornwall – keeping a strong focus on a safe and successful mission for all.&quot;</p><p>Virgin Orbit flies LauncherOne under the wing of a 747 to reduce the rocket size and fuel needed while eliminating the need for a vertical launch pad. For its maiden &quot;Start Me up&quot; mission, Cosmic Girl will take off from the spaceport and fly to a height of 35,000 feet, then release the LauncherOne rocket that will take the satellites into orbit. Permits for the nine satellites have yet to be issued, but are reportedly &quot;imminent.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite being the widest release of all time in Japan, <em>Avatar: The Way of the Water</em><a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/japan-box-office-avatar-the-way-of-water-1235466135/">failed</a> to claim the top ranking last weekend as it was topped by an anime basketball picture called <em>The First Slam Dunk</em>. On top of that, multiple theaters in the nation reported technical problems, with one in central Japan <a href="https://twitter.com/ac_odaka/status/1603343579958562816">forced to</a> reduce the 48 fps frame rate down to the traditional 24 fps, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-20/-avatar-sequel-crashes-movie-theater-equipment-in-japan?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans were reportedly turned away from other screenings and issued refunds. Some of the theater chains cited by fans as having issues, including United Cinemas Co., Toho Col, and Tokyu Corp., declined to comment on the problem.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not many movie theaters support high frame rate (HFR) 48 fps playback, as it requires the latest projectors or <a href="https://www.christiedigital.com/about/display-technology/high-frame-rates/">upgrades</a> to existing ones. Normally, movie theaters would be aware of which formats they can play and plan accordingly. But HFR has been used so little that it would be understandable if errors cropped up.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avatar: The Way of the Water</em> is available in multiple formats, including 2D 48 fps, 3D 48 fps and regular 24 fps. If you see the 48 fps version, it only uses the HFR tech for action sequences, while dialog and slower scenes are dialed down to 24 fps (by duplicating frames). Engadget's Devindra Hardawar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-hfr-high-frame-rate-170058030.html">saw the film</a> at 48 fps and liked it, but added that the technology remains divisive.</p><p>Other notable films using HFR were Ang Lee's <em>Gemini Man</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> trilogy. When the latter came out in 2012, I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-28-editorial-48-fps-hobbit-preview-high-frame-rates.html">argued</a> that high frame rates work best with the 3D format as it helps eliminate potential eye strain and even nausea. That's not an issue in 2D, so 24 fps gives the most natural look with none of the video game/soap opera effect that many people dislike.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has said that he will step down as CEO of Twitter once a suitable replacement can be found. On Sunday he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-asks-twitter-users-to-decide-000451423.html">ran a poll</a> asking if he should step down, and the Twitter using public <a href="https://www.engadget.com/it-looks-like-elon-musk-is-going-to-find-someone-new-to-run-twitter-121055836.html">overwhelmingly told him to go</a>. He didn't immediately respond to the results of the poll, but by Tuesday he seemed to have accepted the will of the people, after originally suggesting that he might instead change it so that only paying users could vote in Twitter polls.</p><div id="e3fc38d32fc54aabb721b890cc7be2fd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!

## FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried agrees to extradition to the US

<p>When the Bahamas Attorney General's office announced that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-bahamas-000800321.html">arrested former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, it noted that the former FTX CEO was likely to be extradited at the request of the United States. Just over a week later, that prediction has come true: Bankman-Fried signed extradition papers on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23450344-unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases">unsealed indictment</a>, Bankman-Fried is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-and-civil-charges-200410951.html">facing 8 counts</a> of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, and more. Specifically, the SEC accuses the cryptocurrency founder of "orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud" for "his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire." The Department of Justice has accused him of attempting commodities and securities fraud, conspiring to defraud investors and breaking federal election laws for donating more to political groups than is legally allowed.</p><p>Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-extradition-us/">originally planned to fight extradition</a>, but indicated on Monday that he would reverse course. Now, he will be returning to the US to face those charges, a decision that might be easier on him in the short term. When the former CEO was first arrested in the Bahamas, he was denied bail and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/live-updates/sam-bankman-fried-FTX-arrest/?id=95098098">deemed a flight risk</a>. In the United States, it's possible he could be released on bail.</p><p>Bankman-Fried has previously said that he "didn't ever try to commit fraud," and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-bankman-fried-says-he-didnt-ever-try-commit-fraud-2022-11-30/">doesn't believe he's criminally liable</a> for the fall of FTX.
