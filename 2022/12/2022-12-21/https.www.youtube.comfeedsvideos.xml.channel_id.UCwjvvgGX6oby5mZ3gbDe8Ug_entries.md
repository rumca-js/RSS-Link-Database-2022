The epidemic is now spreading faster in China than anywhere else in the world during the pandemic. In epidemiology, scientists use an R-value to measure how many people on average are infected by a single patient, at the start of the pandemic, in early 2020, the R-value was about 2 or 3. During last winter's surge of omicron in the U.S., the R-value jumped to about 10 or 11. 
Scientists at the Chinese National Health Council estimate that in this outbreak in China, the R-value is as high as 16, spreading faster than previous outbreaks around the world," Cowling said. "That's why China can't continue with its zero policy. The virus is also too transmissible for them."
