<p dir="ltr">The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection received its first patch, and it's a hefty one. Headlining the release is online multiplayer support for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time and customizable button mapping.</p><p dir="ltr">For Game Boy games, dev Digital Eclipse also added more color filter options. Players can choose between black and white, Game Boy green, Game Boy pocket green, and Game Boy light blue.</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, the Switch edition's Home menu icon has now finally been changed to the TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection's box art--an inconsequential change in the grand scheme of things, but a welcome aesthetic tweak. The previous game icon included the four turtles without the game title, but that has now been changed to the cover art with the game title.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tmnt-the-cowabunga-collection-gets-first-big-patch-online-multiplayer-added-for-tmnt-iv/1100-6510227/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Now Gamers Are Suing To Stop Microsoft From Buying Activision Blizzard

<p dir="ltr">Ten self-described gamers have <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/egpbyyqqgvq/Microsoft%20antitrust%202022-12-20%20Complaint.pdf">sued</a> in US federal court to stop Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard. The suit, which cites the Clayton Antitrust Act, claims that the 10 plaintiffs will suffer "threatened loss or damage" through the deal. The complaint goes on to say that the new company will "substantially lessen competition" and "may tend to create a monopoly in various markets."</p><p dir="ltr">While it's unclear how this suit might proceed, it represents yet another roadblock in the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard saga. The deal, which would be one of the largest in video game history, has been awash in controversy from the start, with Microsoft offering Sony a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-to-reportedly-make-concessions-including-10-year-deal-with-playstation-to-get-activision-blizzard-deal-done/1100-6509532/">10-year licensing deal</a> to keep the highly lucrative Call of Duty franchise on PlayStation platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">More recently, the Federal Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-ftc-is-now-suing-microsoft-over-pending-activision-blizzard-merger/1100-6509849/">sued</a> to block the deal, citing concerns that it would harm competition in the video game industry. Previous reporting from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-apparently-split-on-microsoft-activision-decision-report/1100-6509717/">New York Post</a> indicated that the FTC is largely split on whether to pursue such cases against large tech firms in gaming and otherwise, but it appears that the trustbusting side is winning as of late.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-gamers-are-suing-to-stop-microsoft-from-buying-activision-blizzard/1100-6510224/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975850-3969489-steamdeck.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Valve's Steam Deck isn't a brand-new concept. Portable PC gaming devices have existed for years. But the Steam Deck looks poised to be the breakthrough for the platform because it's cheaper than many alternatives and, of course, because it's coming from Valve itself. Who better to handle a handheld Steam machine than the makers of Steam?</p><p>The Steam Deck has been in players' hands for a while now, and now that it's readily available to purchase, more and more players are getting to try it out for themselves every single day. You can read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck review</a> to see what we thought of it, but more than likely, you're ready to dive in for yourself already. As soon as you boot it up, you'll find your Steam library is intact, which is exciting, but not all games are created equal when it comes to playing them via Steam Deck.</p><p>We've rounded up a few dozen of the best games to play on Steam Deck, including major AAA hits, under-the-radar indies, and everything in between. In most cases, these games have already been declared as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steam-deck-introducing-deck-verified/2300-6456470/">Deck Verified</a>" by Valve, meaning it's fully supported without any caveats. We've personally tested all of the games on this list, however, so even in cases where things do come with asterisks, like needing to use the touchscreen momentarily to log into Xbox in one example, we find the games themselves outweigh these minor hiccups and still recommend them as a result.</p><p>You can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-install-epic-games-store-on-steam-deck/1100-6501217/">install Epic Games Store on Steam Deck</a> to broaden your library even more. In most cases in our experience, these games work just as they would on your home PC, which is great when you consider how often Epic hands out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-free-games-for-pc-playstation-xbox-and-switch-right-now/1100-6502774/">free games</a> on its platform. If you want to get the most out of your new toy, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-steam-deck-accessories-to-buy-to-complete-your-setup/1100-6501389/">best Steam Deck accessories</a> As the list of Steam Deck-compatible games grows, so too will this list here. Keep checking back for recommendations on the best games to play on Steam Deck.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975871-elden.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Elden Ring‚Äôs The Lands Between are vast and rich with activities to undertake. At any given moment you're a stone‚Äôs throw away from a hidden dungeon, a brand new area of the map, or a challenging mini-boss. Although the game tells you to seek the shards of the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, it's easy to spend dozens of hours doing other things instead. The Steam Deck is a fantastic way of undertaking some of these shorter tasks in bite-sized chunks, before returning to the main task at hand on a bigger screen with a beefier PC. Steam's ability to seamlessly upload and download cloud saves makes this functionality a breeze. But, if you're playing entirely on the Steam Deck alone, Elden Ring runs very well--no doubt because Valve took steps to ensure the biggest game of the year, which launched around the same time as its Steam Deck, actually worked. Elden Ring looks and plays excellent on the handheld, so you can hop into the Lands Between whenever is most convenient for you. <em>-- Tamoor Hussain</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/elden-ring-pc/US?_$ja=cid:15993313838|agid:129483455501|tid:pla-1554342617210|crid:576525264885|nw:u|rnd:11457657397475566064|dvc:c|adp:|mt:|loc:9061079&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwve2TBhByEiwAaktM1IFieDO3gS-FrykmIwThVHEhrrwKJTUWIVVAV0hqGcVyrm--ksHK-hoCiN4QAvD_BwE">See on Green Man Gaming</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Half-Life 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3976215-3536137-half-life3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Half-Life 2 being great on Steam Deck is basically a given, considering Valve‚Äôs long-term support for the 2004 game. Valve likes to use it and games like Portal as testing grounds and showcases for its new technology, and there are some Steam Deck bells and whistles that make the already fantastic, landmark first-person shooter shine on Deck. Gordon Freeman‚Äôs second adventure still looks and plays great more than 15 years later, but the default control setup also incorporates motion controls. Using Deck‚Äôs capacitive tech, simply laying your thumb on the right control stick activates the motion controls. Setting it up this way means you only use the motion when you are aiming (a bit like Breath of the Wild‚Äôs default controls) and it also allows you to play it like a standard controller FPS game without diving into menus if you so choose. Using motion controls to take out headcrabs is a feature I never knew I wanted, but immediately found myself using and enjoying on Steam Deck. <em>-- Kyle Hillard</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Spiritfarer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3976130-spirit.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spiritfarer is unlike any other farm-life sim you've played. For starters, its "farm" is actually a boat moving through the underworld, which reminds me of another key difference: You're dead. As the operator of the underworld's ferry, you'll meet characters, help resolve their unfinished business, then wave them goodbye as they coast into the Everlight--some unspecified <em>what-comes-after</em> space. All the while, there's plenty of recipes to learn, items to craft, plants to harvest, and more. Your list of duties and quests is long, so you'll have plenty to do over the course of many on-the-go sessions with the game. Just know that passengers aboard your train, plane, or bus may catch you drying your eyes. -- <em>Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/972660/Spiritfarer_Farewell_Edition/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hitman 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975874-hitman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Hitman 3 is the culmination of a half-decade of hard work from IO Interactive, and that's admirable. But also, on Steam Deck, it's a diverse world tour of portable murder playgrounds, and that's pretty neat too, don't you think? If you happen to have access to the earlier games in the Hitman reboot series, this third game houses every level, weapon, and ridiculous costume into one central hub, giving Hitman fans the totality of the franchise's best entries all in the palms of their hands. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_3/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Disco Elysium</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975869-disco.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Disco Elysium is so text-heavy that it can feel like you're actually holding a Kindle when playing it on a Steam Deck, but for fans of deep RPG experiences, it's exactly what you're probably looking for. The latitude for true role-playing is vast and the story goes places that are both smart and unpredictable. The painterly art style also looks great in handheld mode and may have fellow train passengers looking over to see what it is you're doing, which admittedly is a little awkward when you start the game hungover in your underpants. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975872-ffpr.jpg" /><br /><h3><div> </div><p>The classic Final Fantasy series has gotten lovingly restored with the Pixel Remaster, but its other available platform is less than ideal. The mobile versions lack a lot of the customization options that you'll find on PC, and they don't even support controllers so you're forced to use (shudder) touch controls. <em>Gross</em>. But these classic RPGs feel readymade for portable, making Steam Deck the best place to play. Not only can you grind levels while binge-watching a show, but it looks and plays great, and you can even install mods to (for example) fix the font. If you can only get one, Final Fantasy 6 is an absolute masterpiece. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173820/FINAL_FANTASY_VI/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>God of War</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975873-gow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Some games fit Steam Deck because their genre or gameplay elements just feel right at home in a handheld device. Others, Like God of War, are just proof of how powerful the Steam Deck is. God of War is a game that once seemed unlikely to ever come to PC, but in 2022, not only is it available on the platform, it's fully verified and ready to go on Steam Deck. It's so cool to see it in this way, it almost makes one wish for some sort of PlayStation handheld device. Imagine that! <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.gamespot.com9">See on Green Man Gaming</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Left 4 Dead 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975876-l4d2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Few games scream "Valve!" more than Left 4 Dead 2, so it should be a no-brainer for the Steam Deck, and I'm happy to report that playing it on the handheld is actually even better than playing it on console. It runs very smooth and the PC lobbies have always stayed active even after the Xbox community largely fell by the wayside. The controls are simple too, so even if you've been playing for years on PC, you'll quickly intuit how to pick up an axe and start chopping off zombie limbs with friends on the go. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monster Train</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975877-monstertrain.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Much like Slay the Spire, which clearly inspired it, Monster Train is a game well-suited to quick bursts of gameplay. Because it's already available on Xbox, it features controller support, so controlling it on Deck is easy. But just as importantly, the action is readable on the screen, and its turn-based nature lends itself to the type of portable/toilet gaming that Deck enables. However you play it, the gameplay remains some of the very best in the roguelike deckbuilder genre, giving you a great deal of freedom in how you assemble your deck and combine cards from different factions to make each run feel distinct. -- <em>Chris Pereira</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Children of Morta</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975878-morta.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>I like to think of Children of Morta as an underappreciated gem in the dungeon-crawler genre. In it, you play as the pixelated Bergson family, each member of which has their own unique fighting style and weaponry. Clearing out damp and dark caves around your immaculate home is made more engrossing thanks to a fantastic narrator, carrying you off into a fantasy world on even the most tedious bus ride to work. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/330020/Children_of_Morta/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rogue Legacy 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975881-roguelegacy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">This anticipated sequel has finally gotten a full release after an extended early access period, and it might just be the ideal use-case for Steam Deck. The rogue-lite action game has you once again battling through a castle as a cascading series of hiers, each with their own powers, making incremental progress all the way as you inherit new traits and buy permanent upgrades. The new 2D/3D hybrid art style looks fantastic on the Steam Deck screen, and it's the perfect type of easy-to-pick-up, hard-to-put-down experience that thrives on a handheld. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sable</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975882-sable.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If Switch players get Breath of the Wild, at least Steam Deck users get to have Sable. This clearly BOTW-inspired open-world puzzler foregoes combat of any kind in favor of a chilled-out coming-of-age story set in a unique fantasy world full of quests, characters, and secrets. The open-ended game lets you see its credits in as little as three hours or as many as 20+. It's up to you to decide when your ride is over, be that when your flight ends or perhaps months down the line. The music is done entirely by Japanese Breakfast too, giving the entire game a meditative quality that is perfect for a long trip you may not otherwise be looking forward to. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757310/Sable/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sea of Thieves</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975883-sot.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While you do need an internet connection to play Sea of Thieves, that isn't too hard to come by in 2022. Past iterations of Rare's pirate sandbox have been less short session-friendly, but the team has taken strides to improve the game in that area, offering short and sweet daily challenges for all players and introducing new Sea Forts, which are meant to be challenged and won in as little as 15-20 minutes including the time it takes to sell all your loot. Sea of Thieves, like God of War listed earlier in this feature, is the kind of game that you once could only dream about playing on a handheld. But today the future has arrived by boat. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Unpacking</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975885-unpacking.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Unpacking is another one of those games that feels welcoming to short or long sessions alike. In this 2021 wordless wonder from Witch Beam, you learn about unseen characters just by unpacking their boxes on various moving days spread across their life, from childhood into much older age. The point-and-click nature of the game is welcoming to the Steam Deck's multiple input modes, including analog sticks or the touchscreen. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135690/Unpacking/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Valheim</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975886-valheim.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If you didn't play Valheim when it first blew up in 2021--or even if you did--it makes a great Steam Deck game. In large part, that's due to the way it's friendly to both short and long play sessions. Chop down a few trees and work on building your home in the early hours, or party up with friends and take on the game's most unfriendly beasts many hours later. Whether you're new to the Viking survival game or you think you've scoured over every inch of the sandbox, seeing it on Steam Deck can feel like arriving in a whole new world. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vampire Survivors</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975887-vampsurvive.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>An early access game you can grab on the cheap, Vampire Survivors is very simple but shockingly fun. The single-stick shooter has you navigate around hordes of enemies while your weapons fire off automatically, building up experience to buy new weapon upgrades. The deceptively simple premise gets increasingly fiendish and chaotic as more enemies join the fray, and your weapon upgrades get ever-more destructive. It's enough to tempt you to play just one more round until you realize, oh whoops, it's 3 AM. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Witcher 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975888-witcher.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Whenever you can take one of the best RPGs in the world with you on the go, you've gotta do it, I say. The Witcher 3 is also playable on Switch, but it looks and runs better on Steam Deck in my personal experience. Though the game is now seven years old, it's still a benchmark in video game storytelling, especially when it comes to those incredible side quests. Exploring the world, meeting colorful characters, and slaying monsters makes any train ride or picnic so much more interesting. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Banner Saga Trilogy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975889-banner.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The original Banner Saga was the first game I installed when my Steam Deck arrived, and what a debut it was. The tactical RPG and part-time Nordic-styled Oregon Trail is still a lovely experience so many years since launch. The former Mass Effect writers on the team help breathe life into a new cast of characters whom you'll be glad to take with you wherever you go. The first two games are already Deck Verified, while the third one is yet to be tested by Valve, but it plays as intended for me. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Into The Breach</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975890-breach.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For my money, Into the Breach is one of the best-designed games in recent memory, and it's perfectly at home on Deck, thanks to its turn-based nature and bite-sized missions. As the previous Switch release demonstrated, the controls work perfectly well with a gamepad, and the screen here is well up to the task of displaying all of the information you need. Performance is great (it's not terribly demanding from a hardware perspective), and it's a terrific game that you can sink hours into at a time or occasionally glance at while watching something on TV. -- <em>Chris Pereira</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ori and the Blind Forest</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975891-ori.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Metroidvania genre fits like a glove on Steam Deck, and among those, my favorite is the Ori series. While I haven't tested the sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, the original remains an immaculate and tightly-designed genre standout, arguably the best of the past decade. Taking that on the go is already possible on Switch and even Xbox Cloud Gaming, so you've maybe had opportunities to play it in handheld mode before, but if you missed it until now, the Steam Deck is the best of those handhelds thanks to it not requiring an internet connection like Xbox and its larger, nicer screen than Switch. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/Ori_and_the_Blind_Forest_Definitive_Edition/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rez Infinite</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975892-rez.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Steam Deck passes a very important test I have for determining how good any gaming platform is, which is, "Can you play Rez on it?" The answer, thankfully, is yes, and it does so well--Rez Infinite runs quite smoothly and its straightforward control scheme translates well to the Deck's pad. The relatively short nature of each level makes it easy to jump in and out of on Deck, and even with the system's relatively limited battery life, you can still play through everything here without needing to plug in. While you're better off plugging in some headphones to more fully appreciate the killer soundtrack--it sounds good coming out of the speakers, but Rez is all about blasting the music as loudly as possible--this is still an incredible experience and a must-have on Deck. -- <em>Chris Pereira</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/636450/Rez_Infinite/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975893-tabs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There's no shortage of ragdoll brawlers as of late, but for my money, TABS is the best of them. In a very crude way, it almost plays like Age of Empires or other deep strategy games. You'll set up your army of various fighters spanning centuries of human history and prepare to take on formidable foes on the other side of the battlefield. But the loosey-goosey, googley-eyed warriors make it all so silly, and the one-more-try design is perfect for a portable platform like Steam Deck. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/508440/Totally_Accurate_Battle_Simulator/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>SOMA</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/3975867-2940492-somareview_upt2015_20150921nologo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This list would feel incomplete without a horror game on it. SOMA, from Frictional Games--the team that also made the incredible Amnesia series--is one of the finest horror games and stories you'll find on Steam, and it's fully verified for Steam Deck. They say the best setting for a horror game is where the lights are off and the headphones on, and the portability of the Steam Deck means you can go find that setting for yourself even when your PC itself may not have allowed it otherwise. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stardew Valley</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079612-stardewvalley%285%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Stardew Valley might be the most popular farming game on the planet. Created almost entirely by a single developer (Eric Barone), the amount of content packed into its adorable, pixelated world is staggering. What starts as a simple quest to rebuild your grandpa‚Äôs farm quickly turns into something more. You‚Äôll chat with the locals and form relationships, head out on dangerous mining expeditions, and watch as the quaint Pelican Town transforms through the seasons. Its laidback pace makes it a perfect fit for Steam Deck, giving you a chance to stick your hands in the dirt no matter where life takes you. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cursed to Golf</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079613-cursedtogolf%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If you don‚Äôt mind going into fits of rage while riding the subway or sitting in a cab, consider adding Cursed to Golf to your Steam Deck lineup. This golf game is anything but leisurely, as it tasks you with navigating a 2D course filled with ridiculous hazards such as TNT and teleporters--although an assortment of useful power-ups gives you impressive flexibility to complete each stage under par. The goal is to clear all 18 holes in a single playthrough, but you can break your round up into multiple playthroughs to make things more manageable. Tight controls, adorable graphics, and an ever-changing assortment of levels make it easy to sink hours into the indie regardless of where you‚Äôre playing. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726120/Cursed_to_Golf/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cuphead</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079614-cuphead%286%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Don‚Äôt let its colorful, cartoon graphics fool you--Cuphead is a brutally difficult game. You play as the eponymous Cuphead as he battles a series of increasingly difficult enemies on his journey toward the Devil. Battles play out from a 2D perspective and take place in a single room, although each boss always manages to bring something new to the table. Beyond its striking graphics, Cuphead features some of the smoothest combat mechanics on this list, making it a blast to face off against each new villain (even if they destroy you just a few seconds later). Toss in a variety of unlockable weapons and abilities, multiple playable characters, and the stellar Delicious Last Course expansion, and it‚Äôs easy to see why Cuphead remains so popular more than five years after its release. It feels right at home on Steam Deck and is a must-play for anyone who likes challenging action games. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Neon White</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079615-neonwhite%285%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Neon White is all about speed. The FPS revolves around a group of friends tasked with clearing a demon infestation in Heaven, though the story largely plays second fiddle to the blistering action. Each stage sees you barreling towards the exit as fast as possible, slaying any demons that get between you and your destination. Along the way, you‚Äôll pick up Soul Cards--objects that grant you a firearm and movement ability when discarded. Learning how to best utilize these Souls Cards is the key to claiming a spot on the leaderboard. The fast-paced game originally launched on both PC and Switch, so it should come as no surprise that its controls are a perfect fit for Steam Deck. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marvel's Midnight Suns</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079616-midnightsuns%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Developed by the same folks behind XCOM 2, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a tactical-RPG with a Marvel twist. You‚Äôll play as a fully customizable hero (known as The Hunter), as you team up with big names like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man to take down Lilith and the elder god Chthon. Combat isn‚Äôt exactly like XCOM 2, however, as you‚Äôll have access to a card system that grants you powerful abilities on the battlefield--along with a wide assortment of superpowers. Beyond combat, Midnight Suns lets you chat with your teammates at your secret base and unlock new skills that can help turn the tide in battle. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/368260/Marvels_Midnight_Suns/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monster Hunter Rise</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079617-monsterhunterrise%2816%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Rise is another Switch game that eventually found a home on PC, making it well-suited for Steam Deck. The latest game in the franchise does quite a bit to move the series forward, with the Wirebug adding a new verticality to its maps and Rampage quests offering a chaotic break from your usual hunts. Beyond those changes, everything else that made Monster Hunter so popular is here in spades. Whether you enjoy heading out on hunts with a group of friends, meticulously crafting every piece of gear, or trying to slay beasts solo, Monster Hunter Rise is bound to impress. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1446780/MONSTER_HUNTER_RISE/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cult of the Lamb</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079618-cultofthelamb%284%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Part dungeon crawler, part simulator, Cult of the Lamb enlists you as the leader of a tribe of cultists as you try to gain the favor of a mystical being that saved you from death. Combat is fast and fluid, with levels randomly generated for replayability. There are also tons of ways to enhance your skills, giving you plenty of reasons to dive back in for another quest. When you‚Äôre not swinging swords or slinging spells, you‚Äôll need to manage your cult in typical sim-game fashion. That means feeding your members, giving them jobs‚Ä¶ and picking up their poop. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Celeste</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079619-celeste%283%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Celeste is a challenging platformer with an emotional story to tell. It follows Madeline as she navigates her anxiety and depression--and it‚Äôs a story that‚Äôs arguably even more poignant today than it was in 2018. The narrative is best experienced without any spoilers, and it‚Äôs a journey that‚Äôs propelled to incredible heights thanks to its minimalistic graphics and a fluid movement system that works perfectly on Steam Deck. It only takes about eight hours to finish the journey, but completionists can stick around much longer if they want to uncover everything Celeste has to offer. It's a beautiful game that all platforming enthusiasts should play. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Divinity: Original Sin 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079621-divinityoriginalsin2%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">If you‚Äôre looking for a sprawling RPG that‚Äôll consume hundreds of hours of your time, look no further than Divinity: Original Sin 2. Like any good RPG, it first lets you craft a character--giving you the option to play as anything from a noble warrior to an uUndead thief. Once that‚Äôs taken care of, you‚Äôll have free reign to explore the world of Rivellon and engage in strategic, turn-based combat. One of the big draws of Original Sin 2 is that the environment is just as deadly as your sword, and you‚Äôll need to make full use of it to vanquish the game‚Äôs most ruthless bosses. Outside of the thrilling and strategic turn-based combat, you‚Äôll get to interact with a memorable cast of characters, play cooperatively with friends, or wander around leaving chaos in your wake. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dwarf Fortress</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079622-dwarffortress%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After nearly two decades of development, Dwarf Fortress is finally available on Steam (and playable on Steam Deck). The elaborate simulation game tasks you with growing a small settlement of dwarves into a thriving metropolis. There‚Äôs a ridiculous level of depth to the game, as you‚Äôll need to gather resources, craft new gear, engage in combat, build structures, and contend with a dynamic weather system that can impact your city. It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart, but Dwarf Fortress is an intricate game that should please anyone itching for a comprehensive sim. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Card Shark</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079623-cardshark%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Card Shark is an aptly named game that sees you slowly growing your repertoire of card tricks as you try to fool your opponents and grow your wealth. Things start out slow (learning how to trade signals with your partner), but quickly escalate (learning how to shuffle the deck in your favor). If you perform any of these actions poorly, your fellow players will start to grow leery of your intent. It‚Äôs an intriguing premise, and one that‚Äôs pulled together with beautiful graphics, impressive dialogue, and a soundtrack that‚Äôll be stuck in your head long after you put down your Steam Deck. <em>-- Jon Bitner</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arcade Paradise</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4079624-arcadeparadise%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Arcade Paradise starts out unassuming enough, as you go through the tedious work of managing an old laundromat. Soon you discover a few arcade machines sitting in storage in the back room and decide to open them up to the public. As you start to develop your business, you build up more and more cabinets, converting more of the laundromat to a burgeoning arcade business. While you need to manage your business, you can also play all of your own arcade machines to your heart's content. In effect, this makes Arcade Paradise a great minigame collection, letting you dabble in tons of different retro-styled games. And those play habits feed into the business management mechanics as well, as your performance in the arcade machines increases their popularity and profitability. The Steam Deck is a perfect fit, as you can while away the hours playing games or just check in for a day of managing your business while you're on the go. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388870/Arcade_Paradise/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />

## GameSpot's Movie Of 2022: Everything, Everywhere, All At Once

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">One of the first big fight scenes in Everything, Everywhere, All At Once involves Ke Huy Quan slinging a fanny pack around like a meteor hammer inside an IRS building, and things only get weirder and more specific from there on out. In fact, about midway through, you realize very clearly that fanny pack-based combat is actually one of the most grounded things the movie has to offer. It follows it up with hot dog fingers, sentient rocks, a protracted Ratatouille joke, and improvised sex toy gags. Yet somehow, despite all of this (or maybe because of it) Everything Everywhere All At Once managed to stick the landing and run away with the title as GameSpot's Movie Of The Year for 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">It's strange to think that, in an era of endless big-budget Marvel blockbusters and nonstop franchise building, the idea of a "multiverse" has become as close to old hat as it's ever going to get. The idea itself has become less of a story building technique and more of a way for billion dollar companies to cram as much of their IP into a given release as they can--which, don't get us wrong, can make for some pretty fun opportunities to point at the screen and say "hey, I know what that's from!" But Everything Everywhere took that idea and turned it on its head, not by reinventing the multiversal wheel, but by using the trope itself to craft what amounts to an intimate, personal, and above all original story about a family of extraordinarily regular people.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespots-movie-of-2022-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/1100-6510176/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>This year was packed with incredible films, but only 10 of them made the top of our list.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079610-gb-boty-2022movietop10%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>2022 represented a lot of things in the entertainment industry: The return to normalcy for some levels of production, the re-opening of most movie theaters around the United States, and the release of some of the best films any of us have seen in a while. From sci-fi epics to gritty superhero stories, this year was a boon across multiple genres and truly had something for everyone. </p><p>Our editors came together with the arduous task of witling down the best from the rest and eventually landed on ten selections, ranging from all-ages animated features to the sort of horror you'd definitely want to keep away from kids. We've got cape and cowl representation from both of the Big 2, a surprise showing from an old favorite with a decades-late sequel, and a biopic that boasts doing "absolutely no research" about its subject matter at all. </p><p>And don't worry, movies aren't the only things getting love this year. Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-tv-shows-of-2022/2900-4550/">Top 10 TV Shows of 2022</a> to see what streaming services were providing the best content in this already crowded landscape. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nope</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079601-2.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Jordan Peele's follow-up to Us was the surprise none of us knew we needed this year. No, it's not a surprise that Peele made a fantastic film. What is surprising, though, is that he took his talent for weaving in social commentary into horror films and applied it to an entirely new genre. Nope is a sci-fi movie through and through. But it also speaks to exploitation--especially in Hollywood--and how that can lead those being exploited to chase a level of spectacle as long as they possibly can, eager to keep hold of any notoriety that may keep them afloat in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Using the fact that the first ever movie was a collection of images of a Black man riding a horse, Nope paints a picture of a Black family with a deep Hollywood history being left in the dust, as digital imagery takes over. With their family business dwindling and the legacy of their ancestors becoming all but forgotten, the situation becomes dire for the Haywood family, who simply don't want to be erased from the medium their family has served and sacrificed for over generations. - <em>Chris Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Batman</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079602-3.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">I've seen Batman rebooted no less than four times in my life, and though I've enjoyed all iterations to varying degrees, none have fulfilled my Batman-loving dreams more than Matt Reeves' The Batman. Blurring the line between Nolan's realism and the more fantastical comics, The Batman keeps centered everything that makes the hero special without resorting to rehashing storylines we've seen overdone for 30 years.</p><p dir="ltr">This is especially well-handled in how The Batman brushes right past the origin story we've seen too many times to count. We all know how Bruce Wayne became Batman, so Reeves instead reboots us a year or so into Wayne's "Gotham Project." With Robert Pattinson taking up the cape and cowl, we get to see a Batman that's never been portrayed before--as an angsty Nirvana fan who is far from the perfect combatant and infallible detective he ends up becoming in most timelines. Pattinson's Batman--Patman?--hasn't quite figured out how to mask his alterego beneath an opaque veil of public escapades as a billionaire playboy, so The Batman feels like the start of a better-explored arc for Bruce as much as it will be for Batman.</p><p>But my favorite part about The Batman is the depiction of the iconic city itself. Gotham is fully realized in a way I've always wanted. It captures the dark essence and seedy atmosphere of The Animated Series in an incredible, never-before-seen way that other live-action renditions have always strayed from, often going for something similar, but either wackier or more restrained depending on which version you're watching. The Batman's Gotham is its best live-action version ever. It feels alive with major death dealers like Carmine Falcone and small-time crooks alike, and Batman's restless crusade to rid the city of its wickedness both at the top and bottom of its social ladder has never been more mesmerizing. Throw in a cast that stars the likes of John Turturro, Zoe Kravitz, Colin Farrell, and Andy Serkis, and I feel like after enjoying three decades of other people's live-action Batmans, I finally have the overtired but virtuous millennial Batman for <em>me</em>. - <em>Mark Delaney</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prey</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079603-4.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Before this year, there had been six movies that included the Predator aliens. However, it's a huge mixed bag with 1987's Predator and 2010's Predators being the only two fans considered to be "good." That was until 2022, when Prey released on Hulu. Without the Predator branding, and the stigma--one that's slowly going away--of a major franchise being released directly to streaming, many people didn't have their hopes up for the movie. Yet, when it was released, they were blown away.</p><p dir="ltr">Following a Comanche tracker and hunter Naru (Amber Midthunder), this prequel film--it's not really a prequel, just marketed as one--takes place 300 years ago on the Great Plains as Naru is tracking a Predator--one that's tracking her back. What Prey delivers is a Predator movie that's reminiscent of all the things in the franchise we love: hunters taking down prey, cool sci-fi aliens, out-of-this-world weapons, and bombastic action sequences.</p><p dir="ltr">Midthunder's character shines in the role and is one of best protagonists in the Predator series--probably right behind Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch from the first film. While this is a movie about Naru on a journey to find this elusive alien, the film felt bigger than it actually was. It was a smaller-scope story with limited sets that never felt restrained. Between this and 10 Cloverfield Lane, director Dan Trachtenberg has made a great name for himself. - <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Top Gun: Maverick</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079604-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There's no way anybody expected Top Gun: Maverick to meet the hype of being a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. Ultimately, though, it surpassed that hype. There are even some who believe it's better than the original--and that isn't an unreasonable stance to take. Maverick is as perfect as a sequel is ever going to get. It doesn't stray far from the original, but is bigger, louder, with a slew of new and interesting faces, all while never forgetting the core relationship that made the first film work so well.</p><p dir="ltr">In Top Gun, the key was the dynamic between Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (Anthony Edwards). In Maverick, Cruise is matched up against Miles Teller in the role of Goose's son. The movie also fills us in on Maverick's life since the first film, brings back a familiar and important face in Val Kilmer's role of Iceman--and succeeds in making his role be more than just a cameo thrown in to appease fans. This movie is far more emotional than the first Top Gun, with action sequences as beautifully done as the first movie, if not more. It's like a perfect Top Gun storm. What more can you ask for? - <em>Chris Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Barbarian</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079605-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Prior to 2022, writer/director Zach Cregger was known for his work in the sketch comedy show The Whitest Kids You Know. Now, that's been completely overshadowed by Barbarian, one of the best movies of the year. 2022 was a huge year for horror. Look at the rest of this list, as there are multiple horror movies on it, and there are plenty more films that easily could have been in the top 10.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Barbarian, it's best to know as little as possible going into it. It stars Georgina Campbell as Tess, a woman who is interviewing for a job in Detroit and gets an AirBnB in a rundown neighborhood. She arrives and finds it's been double-booked by a man named Keith (Bill Skarsg√•rd). And that's all we'll say about the plot because that's the first few minutes of the movie, and it goes in wild directions from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Barbarian is a movie that will constantly have you screaming, "What the f*** is happening?" multiple times during the viewing. It takes you in so many unexpected directions, and yet, is incredibly easy to follow and digest, two elements of horror movies that aren't mutually exclusive. Barbarian is a triumph for presenting an audience with a story that's exceptionally familiar while surprising us at every corner. - <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>X</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079606-7.jfif.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest surprises of the year is the dawn of the incredibly inventive X franchise of horror movies. X, a slasher set on a Texas farm in the '70s, mixed porn, murder, and a long list of tried and true horror troped into one of the best original horror films in ages. It's not a sequel, a reboot, or a reimagining. Instead, it introduced brand new characters in a movie that stands out from the crowd.</p><p dir="ltr">Even better, it was just the beginning. What we learned after is that right after X finished filming, a prequel was shot that became the truly remarkable Pearl--a film about the old woman on the farm and how she became, well, the monster we meet in the first movie. And now, a sequel is in the works about the final girl from X. This franchise is a spotlight shining on Mia Goth, the actress at the center of each of the movies, and we're all better off for it. - <em>Chris Hayner</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Turning Red</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079607-8.jfif.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">While coming-of-age stories are a dime a dozen, coming-of-age stories centered around women--and more specifically, women of color--are still sorely missing from mainstream media. However, Pixar's Turning Red isn't notable solely for helping to remedy this problem. What makes the film stand out as one of 2022's best movies is its charm, sincerity, and willingness to explore complex topics--topics like generational trauma, being a first-generation immigrant, and mother-daughter relationships--while also making you feel all the joy, magic, and "cringe" that comes with simply being a 13-year-old girl.</p><p dir="ltr">In Meilin and her boyband-obsessed best friends, I saw myself and my own friends, fawning over some emo band or the latest vampire-filled young adult novel. In her risque drawings she tries her hardest to keep her overbearing mother from finding, I saw my folder of fanfiction I would have been <em>mortified</em> to let my own mother so much as glance at. And, in the dynamic we see between Meilin and her mother that leads her down the well-trodden path of people-pleasing and repressing her own needs and emotions, I saw myself and my own mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Turning Red using vibrant colors, a bombastic animation style, and mythical transformations to symbolize a young girl's loss of control over her emotions and body that culminate in kaiju fights, it somehow manages to feel earnest and grounded. It's an incredible accomplishment and a beautiful ode to loud, brilliant daughters and the mothers who love them in every way they know how. - <em>Jessica Howard</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079608-8.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When describing Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, it's nearly impossible to describe the movie without accidentally saying, "It's really weird." Most musical biopics revolve around the real-life struggles of a musician trying to make it in an industry that tells them "no" over and over again. Additionally, said musician also deals with addiction issues as they are their own worst enemy. Weird follows this same format, but there's just one difference: the vast majority of what happens in the movie never happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Most biopics take some liberties here and there with history, Weird decides to spew inaccuracies for two hours in the funniest way possible. Hitting major moments in Yankovic's career--again, with <em>all</em> the liberties taken--Weird tells the story of a parody artist rising to fame. It is undoubtedly the funniest movie of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of the polka parody king of music is beyond perfect--even though Radcliffe never actually sings in the movie, Yankovic does with Radcliffe lip-syncing. The film features great comedic actors as well, and there isn't a scene that won't leave you laughing your ass off. Best part yet, it was and is free to watch on Roku--with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Weird is amazing, and it has changed the course of history as we know it. "Beat It" by Michael Jackson is actually a parody of "Eat It," and now we all know it. - <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079609-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The second Black Panther had what seemed like an insurmountable task ahead of it. After the untimely passing of star Chadwick Boseman, the film had to reset the franchise's course by enlisting a new Black Panther, while also paying tribute to the actor. With such heavy emotional stakes coming at the tail end of what has largely been a very scattershot Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have been easy to falter.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, though, this was the best post-Avengers: Endgame film by leaps and bounds. It set up massive stakes for the future and introduced new characters. However, it also managed to celebrate the life of Boseman and the character he played, King T'Challa. This was an incredibly emotional movie, made by a cast and creatives mourning the loss of a dear friend and leader. The care and respect for Boseman was felt throughout the film and made for a unique viewing experience. - <em>Chris Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>GameSpot's Top Movie Of 2022: Everything Everywhere All At Once</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4079600-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Timing, as they say, is everything. It's impossible to imagine a better year for a movie like Everything Everywhere All At Once to have hit theaters. The little indie movie, with a visual effects department made up of self-taught amateurs, barreled full-steam into the sci-fi trope and concept of the multiverse, which the MCU juggernaut had recently set its own multi-billion dollar sights on and, against all odds, did it better.</p><p dir="ltr">On the surface, Everything Everywhere is the story of the deeply mundane Wang family. They own a laundromat that's struggling with taxes, there's a potential divorce looming on the horizon, their daughter is constantly at odds with them and they're constantly at odds with their in-laws. It's the furthest thing from a sci-fi epic until suddenly, it isn't. Matriarch Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is abruptly thrust into a multiverse-hopping journey when an alternate version of her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) interrupts her meeting with the IRS to tell her she's the chosen one.</p><p dir="ltr">It's funny, sure‚Äìmaybe one of the funniest movies this year‚Äìbut more importantly, it's completely original. Everything Everywhere is the antidote to corporate IP burn-out, a hilarious and deeply self-aware movie with a massive heart and a message that goes beyond promoting the latest sequel or hawking streaming service subscriptions for new TV shows. And, hey, no other movie this year involved a sex toy-based martial arts fight scene or a tear-jerking scene with stop-motion boulders wearing googly eyes. - <em>Mason Downey</em></p></h3></p><br />

## Don't Expect A Director's Cut Of Avatar: The Way Of Water

<p>Avatar: The Way of Water just released in theaters five days ago. But that's not stopping people from wondering if James Cameron will release a director's cut of the sequel in the future. The current answer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kate-winslet-recorded-her-reaction-to-holding-her-breath-for-7-minutes-for-avatar-2/1100-6510004/">Don't hold your breath like Kate Winslet</a> during filming.</p><p dir="ltr">Producer Jon Landau talked with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23518656/avatar-2-way-water-directors-cut-streaming-james-cameron">Polygon</a> recently about Avatar: The Way of Water and a possible director's cut. If you didn't know, Cameron had some intriguing ideas for a 6-hour, streaming-specific version of a film and then a regular theatrical release of the same movie in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/denis-villeneuve-james-cameron-avatar-dune-1235132632/">a Variety feature piece</a>. Landau tried to explain the situation and why that's not comparable to the Avatar sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Jim is seizing on opportunities for other stories with two different cuts--the idea would be that you build a larger, epic narrative that can last 6 hours, and you pull a 2-and-a-half-hour movie out of it," Landau said. Regarding The Way of Water or even Avatar 3 receiving extended editions, Landau stated: "We don't have the amount of content to do that."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-a-directors-cut-of-avatar-the-way-of-water/1100-6510219/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Although it's not yet certain whether future films in the Avatar franchise will definitely move forward, writer-director James Cameron was thinking ahead while in production on Avatar: The Way of Water. Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/james-cameron-shot-avatar-sequels-same-time-stranger-things-effect/?mibextid=Zxz2cZ">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Cameron explained to help future-proof younger actors quickly aging across each film, he shot scenes from Avatar 3 and Avatar 4 concurrently with the recently released sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">The Way of Water introduces several young characters, including Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, who was 7 years old when cast and is now 13) and Spider (Jack Champion, who was 12 when cast but is now 18). Because Champion was "growing like a weed," the second, third, and first act of the fourth movie had to be done in one production.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-cameron-wanted-to-avoid-a-stranger-things-effect-with-avatar-sequels/1100-6510218/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Goat Simulator 3 Ad Includes GTA 6 Leaks, Gets DMCA Notice From Take-Two

<p dir="ltr">An ad for Goat Simulator 3 featured some trollish antics typical of the game itself, as it included gameplay from the massive GTA 6 leak that emerged earlier this year. It didn't take long for GTA publisher Take-Two to issue a DMCA notice to take down the video.</p><p dir="ltr">The ad, which is currently unavailable, featured a humorous overview of an NPC named Shaun, who describes his duties as walking around in circles, picking things up, and sitting on a bench. The GTA 6 clip comes late in the ad, when Shaun says that you can see him in some "footage that was leaked a couple of months ago."</p><p dir="ltr">The fact that the Goat Simulator developers responded to the original tweet with the memetic "I'm in danger" GIF from The Simpsons indicates that they probably knew what they were doing here.

## Witcher Author Isn't Forcing Himself Into Netflix's Blood Origin, Just Wants To "Enjoy The Soup"

<p dir="ltr">Netflix is continually growing its Witcher Universe on the streaming service. There have already been two seasons of the mainline series with a third in the works, an animated movie about Vesemir, and on Christmas, there is a prequel series about the creation of the first Witcher.</p><p dir="ltr">While many know of Geralt and his world because of the Witcher games--primarily CD Projekt Red's Witcher 3--its origin comes from the mind of Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski and his various Witcher Saga novels. But how involved was the novelist with the upcoming series Witcher: Blood Origin, which arrives on December 25?</p><p dir="ltr">According to executive producer Lauren Hissrich, he was hands off and happy to give the reins over to the creative team. "We are so lucky," Hissrich told GameSpot. "Working with Andrzej has been amazing because he is very clear with us. He wrote the books. He's a novelist, and had he wanted to write a TV show he would have written a TV show. So he has given us the creative freedom to kind of take his stories and express them in sort of a new format that he himself could not would not. So that part's been incredible because he does get all the scripts.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-author-isnt-forcing-himself-into-netflixs-blood-origin-just-wants-to-enjoy-the-soup/1100-6510213/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Faster. Bigger. These are just two of the descriptions Amazon is placing on The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power for the second season of the fantasy series. Vernon Sanders, who is head of global TV for Amazon Studios, recently opened up about what to expect when the show returns.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/lotr-the-rings-of-power-amazon-vernon-sanders-interview-investment-season-2-spoilers-pace-battles-season-3-renewal-1235201384/">Deadline</a>, Sanders responded to a question about lessons learned from the first season and how they're using that knowledge going forward with The Rings of Power. "We are going to be faster," he said. "We are going to be able to put more money on screen, just in terms of the scale and scope of what we're doing now that we know how to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">"And I also think the pace of our story is going to increase in part because the story is demanding that now that everyone's been established, the stakes are established, that we're going to watch some characters in some lands go to war."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotr-rings-of-power-season-2-will-pick-up-the-pace/1100-6510215/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## GameSpot's 10 Best Horror Movies of 2022

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079412-horror.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A line we keep repeating here over and over again is "2022 was a great year for horror movies." There's a reason for that: it was. If you take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-horror-movies-of-the-year-according-to-metacritic/2900-4544/">Best Horror Movies of 2022, According to Metacritic</a> piece, you'll see 10 movies from this past year that are critically-acclaimed, and each one of them is now in the best 100 horror movies of all time. That's quite the accomplishment.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the staff here at GameSpot has some differing opinions compared to the review aggregate Metacritic list. Again, it's a great year for horror, a varied year for horror, and a year that produced a ton of horror content.</p><p dir="ltr">So going through the past year of scary-flicks, we found the 10 best horror movies of the past year. From spooky ghosts terrorizing livestreamers to a familiar masked-slasher killing teens, there's a large variety here for the genre. Hopefully, you'll find some movies here that you haven't seen yet and will want to check out.</p><p dir="ltr">This list is dedicated to longtime GameSpot entertainment writer Dan Auty, who passed away earlier this year. Since the start of the entertainment section of GS, Dan has been here, often talking and writing about his love for horror movies. Typically, he's covered our end of the year horror movie round-ups and was a driving force behind a lot of the content during "Spooky season."</p><p dir="ltr">Not a day goes by that the we don't think about Dan or miss him. And just to share what we consider a very funny story, in the days before his passing, and we knew what was coming, Chris E. Hayner and I (Mat Elfring) talked to Dan and convinced him to watch Netflix's Texas Chainsaw Massacre--a truly terrible movie. He knew it wasn't going to be a good film, by any stretch of the imagination, but Dan was always game to try and watch something silly. While he did actually watch the movie before his passing, we never got to hear his thoughts about it. We have to believe he found a way to enjoy it, though, as Dan was always in good spirits and loved a crappy flick. We love ya, Dan.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, let's talk about some good horror movies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prey</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079417-prey.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Before this year, there had been six movies that included the Predator aliens. However, it's a huge mixed bag with 1987's Predator and 2010's Predators being the only two fans considered to be "good." That was until 2022, when Prey released on Hulu. Without the Predator branding, and the stigma--one that's slowly going away--of a major franchise being released directly to streaming, many people didn't have their hopes up for the movie. Yet, when it was released, they were blown away.</p><p dir="ltr">Following a Comanche tracker and hunter Naru (Amber Midthunder), this prequel film--it's not really a prequel, just marketed as one--takes place 300 years ago on the Great Plains as Naru is tracking a Predator--one that's tracking her back. What Prey delivers is a Predator movie that's reminiscent of all the things in the franchise we love: hunters taking down prey, cool sci-fi aliens, out-of-this-world weapons, and bombastic action sequences.</p><p dir="ltr">Midthunder's character shines in the role and is one of best protagonists in the Predator series--probably right behind Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch from the first film. While this is a movie about Naru on a journey to find this elusive alien, the film felt bigger than it actually was. It was a smaller-scope story with limited sets that never felt restrained. Between this and 10 Cloverfield Lane, director Dan Trachtenberg has made a great name for himself. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Barbarian</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4077743-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Prior to 2022, writer/director Zach Cregger was known for his work in the sketch comedy show The Whitest Kids You Know. Now, that's been completely overshadowed by Barbarian, one of the best movies of the year. 2022 was a huge year for horror. Look at the rest of this list, as there are multiple horror movies on it, and there are plenty more films that easily could have been in the top 10.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Barbarian, it's best to know as little as possible going into it. It stars Georgina Campbell as Tess, a woman who is interviewing for a job in Detroit and gets an AirBnB in a rundown neighborhood. She arrives and finds it's been double-booked by a man named Keith (Bill Skarsg√•rd). And that's all we'll say about the plot because that's the first few minutes of the movie, and it goes in wild directions from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Barbarian is a movie that will constantly have you screaming, "What the f*** is happening?" multiple times during the viewing. It takes you in so many unexpected directions, and yet, is incredibly easy to follow and digest, two elements of horror movies that aren't mutually exclusive. Barbarian is a triumph for presenting an audience with a story that's exceptionally familiar while surprising us at every corner. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nope</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079421-nope.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Jordan Peele's follow-up to Us was the surprise none of us knew we needed this year. No, it's not a surprise that Peele made a fantastic film. What is surprising, though, is that he took his talent for weaving in social commentary into horror films and applied it to an entirely new genre. Nope is a sci-fi movie through and through. But it also speaks to exploitation--especially in Hollywood--and how that can lead those being exploited to chase a level of spectacle as long as they possibly can, eager to keep hold of any notoriety that may keep them afloat in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Using the fact that the first-ever movie was a collection of images of a Black man riding a horse, Nope paints a picture of a Black family with a deep Hollywood history being left in the dust, as digital imagery takes over. With their family business dwindling and the legacy of their ancestors becoming all but forgotten, the situation becomes dire for the Haywood family, who simply don't want to be erased from the medium their family has served and sacrificed for over generations. -- <em>Chris E. Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deadstream</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079422-deadstream.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">2022 was a great year for the writer/director team of Vanessa and Joseph Winter and actor Melanie Stone. The trio worked on two major projects this year, one of which being the story "To Hell and Back" from V/H/S/99, and the other being the found footage horror comedy Deadstream.</p><p dir="ltr">Comedy and horror can blend together incredibly well when you're laughing with the movie, not just at it. Deadstream has both, as we're laughing with the jokes and at the main character Shawn (Joesph Winter), a cringey internet personality who is trying to win back his followers by staying in a haunted house, which turns out to actually be haunted--featuring some great work by Melanie Stone as the ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadstream is incredibly silly and at times, it has a few jump scares. 2022 was overpowered with great films that took themselves very seriously, so Deadstream ended up being a simple and really fun compliment to the year which stood out because it included humor. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>X</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4077748-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest surprises of the year is the dawn of the incredibly inventive X franchise of horror movies. X, a slasher set on a Texas farm in the '70s, mixed porn, murder, and a long list of tried and true horror troped into one of the best original horror films in ages. It's not a sequel, a reboot, or a reimagining. Instead, it introduced brand-new characters in a movie that stands out from the crowd.</p><p dir="ltr">Even better, it was just the beginning. What we learned after is that right after X finished filming, a prequel was shot that became the truly remarkable Pearl--a film about the old woman on the farm and how she became, well, the monster we meet in the first movie. And now, a sequel is in the works about the final girl from X. This franchise is a spotlight shining on Mia Goth, the actress at the center of each of the movies, and we're all better off for it. -- <em>Chris E. Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pearl</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079424-pearl.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Pearl was one of the biggest surprises of the year because, well, who knew they made a prequel to X while filming X? Mia Goth's performance as the titular farmgirl, first introduced as an old woman in X, is simply incredible. With a tragic life at home, we see Pearl unravel as she comes to terms with the fact that she's doomed to live in her small town seemingly forever--and the violent turn she takes to cope with it.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie is highlighted by one of the absolute best monologues seen in a movie in years, in which her desperation to escape finally comes to a head. It's not often that we think about including horror in awards discussion, but the work done by Mia Goth in this film is certainly worthy of that kind of recognition. -- <em>Chris E. Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Watcher</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079425-watcher.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">No, we're not talking about the Netflix series. We're talking about the Chloe Okuno-directed horror movie that came out earlier this year. Starring Maika Monroe--who made waves starring in the horror phenomenon It Follows a few years prior--Watcher follows an American woman and her husband, as they move to Bucharest.</p><p dir="ltr">The woman spends a lot of time home alone and notices across the street--in another building--someone in the shadows has been watching her, just staring. She begins to feel followed wherever she goes and becomes more worried when there may be a connection to a serial killer.</p><p dir="ltr">Watcher is a movie about paranoia and always feeling at unease, along with being completely gaslit by those around you--two very typical tropes in horror. However, what sets this apart from others like it are the performances. Every word that comes out of Monroe's mouth is believable, and yet, no one believes her, and this is exceptionally frustrating. On the other side of the coin, Burn Gorman gives the performance of his career. He is chilling, terrifying, and a perfect balance to what Monroe brings. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Black Phone</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079426-blackphone.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Director Scott Derrickson's return to horror was an exceptionally successful one in 2022. Much like his previous work in Sinister and Deliver Us from Evil, Black Phone revolves around uncovering the truth and being confronted with atrocities. However, Black Phone had a much different approach than his other movies.</p><p dir="ltr">The film follows a young boy named Finney who is abducted by a villainous masked man named The Grabber (Ethan Hawke), and the boy is held captive in a basement with a mattress and a black phone that's not plugged into anything. However, the phone rings and Finney soon finds that The Grabber's former victims--who are all ghosts--are trying to help Finney escape. Black Phone is haunting because it's a departure from what we typically see in movies like this, as we learn that the Grabber is far worse a person as the movie goes on. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scream</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079427-scream.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Every Scream movie is a great Scream movie. That's a rule that has yet to be broken, even with the franchise returning this year after being dormant for so long. The fifth movie in the series, which is simply titled "Scream" for some reason, introduced a new cast of heroes (victims) for Ghostface to take aim at with his knife and it was a real treat. The entire new cast was fantastic, the killer(s?) was revealed with a fun and unpredictable twist, and the stage has now been set for future films. In fact, Scream 6 comes out in 2023, with most of the surviving cast from the last movie (minus Neve Campbell) returning to do battle with Ghostface in New York City. We can't wait. -- <em>Chris E. Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Crimes of the Future</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4079428-crimes.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There are very few directors out here doing it like David Cronenberg, and his latest, Crimes of the Future, is no exception. It's a feverish, compact little horror-drama that's simultaneously an elegant commentary on the state of things like health care and medical science while also focusing on exactly the kind of body horror and practical gore Cronenberg is famous for. It's set in a world where medicine and technology have advanced so dramatically that human evolution is responding in kind, producing aberrations in people that cause them to do things like spontaneously generate new organs. Meanwhile, the near complete elimination of physical pain has allowed for things like "artistic" surgery to take the world by storm, allowing people to practice any manner of body modification, publicly or privately.</p><p dir="ltr">The story centers on a performance artist (Viggo Mortensen) who performs live surgery on himself to remove his new organs catching the attention of multiple extremist organizations who--actually, going into much more detail here would start spoiling things, so we're just going to let you use your imagination for this one. Or better yet, steal your stomach and dive into it as blind as possible because if you're a fan of gooey practical effects and Cronenberg's trademark surreal style, this isn't one to miss. -- <em>Mason Downey</em></p></h3></p><br />

He shared a photo of himself standing atop a rock structure next to the main Orc, saying he feels a range of emotions thinking back on that day.</p><div>                </div><p>"It really does seem like a lifetime ago. I had climbed up on the rock to do final makeup and armor checks for the actor who about to deliver their 'big moment.' The first Assistant Director was sharing some thoughts that I was to pass onto the actor. I had stopped what I was doing and was intently trying to hear over the rumble of the army that was spread out below us. It causes me a unique mix of emotions seeing these photos again, as I recall the sense that I had standing up there looking down on this incredible scene, from this unique vantage point, and feeling somewhat in awe of the moment," Taylor said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-lord-of-the-rings-two-towers-turns-20-weta-boss-reflects-on-the-milestone/1100-6510210/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
