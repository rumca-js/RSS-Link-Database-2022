The GTA 6 clip comes late in the ad, when Shaun says that you can see him in some \"footage that was leaked a couple of months ago.\"\n\nGTA publisher Take-Two did not find this bit funny at all, and it didn't take long for the company to issue a DMCA notice to take down the video.\n\nIn other news, the director of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recently spoke with Game Informer and explained features we can expect from the upcoming game.\u00a0\n\nThere are a total of five lightsaber stances, including a dual-blade stance and one where Cal wields both a lightsaber and a blaster. A new heavy and slow style uses the crossguard lightsaber, as introduced by Kylo Ren. These new stances will let you hit harder or from farther away, but whether you should use them depends on the enemies you will be facing.\n\nIf you want to play a space game right now, look no further than High On Life.\u00a0\n\nThe wild and wacky shooter from Squanch Games is tearing it up on Xbox Game Pass. Benji Sales on Twitter found a list that showed the new game from Ricky and Morty's Justin Roiland as the No. 1 \"most-popular\" Xbox Game Pass title earlier this week. The game's own Twitter account re-shared the tweet.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsvX122FnuU", "date_published": "2022-12-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What To Know When Upgrading your Gaming PC With GIGABYTE", "description": "Whether you\u2019re looking to get a new PC or just upgrade some key components, we\u2019ve teamed up with GIGABYTE AORUS to give you a crash course in how to elevate your PC gaming hardware.
