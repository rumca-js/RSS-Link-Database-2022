Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking practically everything we need to stay alive. It looks like we’ll only ever have small crews spend a miserable time hidden underground. Except, we could terraform it into a green new world. But to solve the planet’s problems, we first need to make it worse and turn it into oceans of lava with gigantic lasers.

This video was animated with help from our friends at Thought Cafe. Check out their Video "Could We Live on Mars?" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQqHDEYpIvI
