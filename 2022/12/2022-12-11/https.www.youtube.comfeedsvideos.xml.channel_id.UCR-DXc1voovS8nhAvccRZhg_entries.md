Having trouble finding a Raspberry Pi 4 model B? This SBC is way faster, with a ton more features! The footprint is slightly larger, and there are some caveats when it comes to running Linux, but it's worth a deeper look!

I bought mine on AmeriDroid: https://ameridroid.com/products/rock5-model-b?_pos=2&_sid=94cb486f9&_ss=r

I plan on doing a full review next year, when I'm back to work again. Right now I'm still recovering, so it'll be some time before I can really put it through its paces!
