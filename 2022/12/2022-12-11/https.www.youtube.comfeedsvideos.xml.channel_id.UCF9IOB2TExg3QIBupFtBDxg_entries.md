What is risk information management?

Thinking about risk, what do we mean by absolute risk and relative risk

Sounds a bit like the level of risk can be presented in a way that gives a particular impression of a greater or a lessor risk or benefit?

Are there occasions when a vested interest might want to give an impression of an increased benefit, or reduced risk from an intervention?

How could choosing RRR versus ARR influence the impression given for adverse reactions is medical journals?

Conversely

Are there occasions when a vested interest might want to give an impression of a decreased risk from an intervention?

So will RRR always be higher than ARR?

Why can the RRR vary between populations and vary over time?

So using one of the two measures to estimate the risk/benefit ratio would lead to different conclusions?

How could risk / benefit reporting be optimised in the medical literature?

Do you think the editors of prestigious international journals are aware of the differences between RRR and ARR?

In the case of this paper from the Journal of Expert Reviews of Vaccines

Efficacy and effectiveness of covid-19 vaccine - absolute vs. relative risk reduction

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9115787/

The original phase three data gave an efficacy for Pfizer vaccine, at preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 of 95%, but it turns out the ARR was 0.84%

Why are these figures so different?

So is it fair to say that the ‘real world translation’ of the ARR of the Pfizer vaccine over 5 to 6 months of use increased to 3.7%?

What do we mean by number needed to treat?

Chinese and Western vaccines compared

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-63855508

Big changes, all of a sudden

Live with the virus

Vice-premier, Sun Chunlan

China entering a new situation

Virus ability to cause disease weakening

Lifting most severe Covid policies

End of quarantine camps

People can isolate at home

No more family separations

Close contacts not taken to camps

Strict ban on blocking fire exits

No need to show tests for venues

Less rules on internal travel

Lateral flow tests to replace PCR tests in most areas

Lockdowns continue in smaller more targeted areas

Foreign travel soon

Cases, 30,000 +

Now

Everyone will be exposed

Will the medical system will be overwhelmed?

National Health Commission

All localities, focus on improving the vaccination rate of people aged 60-79, 

accelerating the vaccination rate of people aged 80 and above, 

and making special arrangements

Prof Ivan Hung, Hong Kong University

The main way for China to exit Covid with the least damage is via vaccination and three doses of vaccination is a must

Hopefully before Chinese New Year (January 22) Rabbit

Sinopharm

Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)

https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know

The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and above. 

Individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.

An inactivated vaccine with adjuvant

(that is routinely used in many other vaccines)

with a documented good safety profile, including in pregnant women. 

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and efficacy against hospitalization 79%

Does it prevent infection and transmission?

No substantive data

Does it work against new variants of SARS-
CoV-2 virus?

SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine

Not yet been evaluated in the context of circulation of widespread variants of concern.

How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?

We cannot compare the vaccines head-to-head,

(different approaches taken in designing the respective studies)

but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing,

are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.

BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19

Later analysis from
