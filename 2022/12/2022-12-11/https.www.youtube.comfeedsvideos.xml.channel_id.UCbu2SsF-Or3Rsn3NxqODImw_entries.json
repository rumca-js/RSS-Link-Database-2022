First of all, let me just make that clear,\u201d Miyazaki says in the interview.\n\nMiyazaki then enforced how important customizing the mechs is going to be, stating that you will be able to change out individual parts, and that the system will be way more involved and detailed than simply swapping out armor sets like in Dark Souls or Elden Ring. The key to winning, he states, will be fine tuning your mech for whatever task at hand.\n\nThe last major tidbits of the interview are that the game will be mission focused rather than an open world a la Elden Ring, and that from a story perspective, this entry will act as a reboot for the franchise, with, \u201cno direct links with the previous games in terms of continuing story.\u201d\n\nArmored Core 6 wasn\u2019t the only announcement at this year\u2019s Game Awards. We also learned that PlayStation Studios and Hoursemarque\u2019s Returnal would also be coming to PC before the end of the year. If you planned on picking the game up, however, you\u2019re going to need to check those PC specs, because its RAM requirements are head scratching.\n\nTypically, a modern game on PC with require a minimum for 8 gigs of RAM and a recommended 16GBs to play on more optimal settings. Returnal\u2019s PC port doubles those numbers, with a minimum of 16GBs in order to run the game and a recommended 32GBs in for higher quality settings.\n\nWhile 32GBs isn\u2019t a wild amount of ram (many recent, high end PCs house 64GBs or more), plenty of people purchase or build PCs with only 16GBs, especially if the rig is a little older, and most gaming laptops still hedge to 16GBs with only the most expensive offering upgrades to 32GBs or more. In short, it seems you\u2019re going to need a pretty beefy rig if you want to play the game at higher resolutions or framerates.\n\nSo no Switch port for Returnal anytime soon it seems. A game that does run on the Switch is Fortnite, which is adding YouTube\u2019s most popular content creator, Mr. Beast, to the game via its Icons line of skins, and the guy will be bringing the giveaway antics that made him so popular in the first place to the battle royale.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArWZ3vwkpFY", "date_published": "2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How Games Get LMGs Wrong - Loadout", "description": "From Call of Duty and Battlefield, to Rambo and Commando, the machine gun has long been an iconic entry to the most blockbuster action movie, and an essential part of any video game arsenal for decades.
