In the rolling hills of Austin Texas, a group of outcasts have banded together to survive in the woods. Working by day, camping by night, these people have found their home nestled between the railroad tracks and the river, in a forest where they can be left alone, but not for long. Each day the train horn tolls through the trees, signifying the industry that encroaches ever closer, in a city that grows perpetually, until eventually there will be nowhere left for the forest folk to go.
