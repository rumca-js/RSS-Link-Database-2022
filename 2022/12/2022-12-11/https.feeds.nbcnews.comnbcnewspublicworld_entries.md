Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country’s authorities are “doing everything” they can to restore power in the southern city of Odesa and its surrounding areas after it was targeted by Russian strikes. The drone strikes on the region’s infrastructure left more than 1.5 million people without power, Ukraine’s authorities said.
