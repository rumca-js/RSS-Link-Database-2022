Rep.-elect George Santos (R-NY) is a degenerate liar. But the question of whether he should keep his seat is not one for party functionaries or members of Congress to decide. It’s for the people of New York's 3rd Congressional District. This is how it works in our constitutional republic. Voters get final say, as they should. Also, leaving the decision to Santos's constituents will go a long way toward answering that increasingly pertinent question: When is enough enough for voters?
