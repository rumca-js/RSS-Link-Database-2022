<p>In a series of short essays, writers consider what happiness means to them now, after the reckoning of the past few years</p><p>Three years ago my partner dropped me at Southern Cross uni in Lismore, agreeing to text in a couple of hours. My latest novel had just won Australia’s biggest literary prize, and the Bundjalung mob on campus had invited me down to give a talk. Reader, as I headed into the Indigenous Centre that September afternoon, I was walking on air. Even when our preliminary cuppas were interrupted by the misfunctioning emergency siren, my mood didn’t falter. Everyone groaned, then laughed. We waited for technicians to stop the damn thing. Conversation was impossible, drowned out every 60 seconds by a screeching siren, followed in turn by: Attention! Attention! An emergency situation has been declared!</p><p>This racket went on for five, 10, 20 minutes. Happens all the time, I was assured. I began to think I’d driven a very long way just to listen to its endless blaring. It’s funny how the worst news sometimes gets blanked out. I can’t remember who discovered the alarm was working perfectly. But whoever got that first call or text, very soon we all knew: there was a gunman roaming around on campus. The warning wasn’t an annoying mistake after all. The emergency was real.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/01/melissa-lucashenko-hiding-from-an-assassin-concentrates-the-mind-wonderfully">Continue reading...</a>

Fleetwood’s mother, Sue, died at the age of 60 in July.

<p>It’s been a long time since this old steam carriage saw active service on the Australian railways. But now it’s been restored as a first class home</p><p>Nestled at the end of a quiet, unmade lane in Forrest, a former logging town full of weatherboard shacks two hours from Melbourne, you are greeted by a couple of unexpected properties: a quirky steam train carriage and a three-storey cabin made out of wood and upcycled train parts. Neither are your stereotypical Australian structures, but then convention is not something that the owners, Fleur and Mike Leslie, are drawn to.</p><p>The black-painted steam carriage, located on the fringes of the Great Otway national park, close to lush surrounding rainforest and world-class nature walks and bike trails, lends a nostalgic nod to days gone by – a time when life was less frenetic and train travel more elegant. “We bought the plot back in 2013. It had been on the market for many years and was totally run down, but immediately triggered a reaction in us both,” says Fleur. “Initially we were drawn to the main house and the train was an aside, but it quickly became a passion project, too.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/31/all-aboard-an-adventurous-home-life-on-a-restored-steam-carriage">Continue reading...</a>

## I Wanna Dance With Somebody review – doggedly formulaic Whitney Houston biopic

<p>The singer’s voice is mostly lip-synced, by British actor Naomi Ackie, but this by-numbers film falls well short of capturing Houston’s mega-watt appeal</p><p>Given the movie-friendly trajectory of Whitney Houston’s life and career (stellar rise; glittering success; tragic fall: check!), the main surprise is that it took as long as it did for her to end up as fodder for the always-hungry music biopic industry. What’s no surprise at all, unfortunately, is that this doggedly formulaic picture struggles to capture even a fraction of the electrifying sparkle of Houston at the peak of her powers. As music mogul Clive Davis (Stanley Tucci) says, having just had his comb-over blasted several feet off his balding pate by the young Whitney’s vocal range, hers was a once-in-a-generation voice. </p><p>Not surprisingly, it’s predominantly Houston’s voice we hear in the film, with British actor Naomi Ackie lip-syncing pretty convincingly in the central role. But Houston was more than just that incredible voice. Her stage presence, her style, her winning charisma: it all combined into something unique. Something that Ackie only sporadically captures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/31/i-wanna-dance-with-somebody-review-doggedly-formulaic-whitney-houston-biopic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A good night’s sleep is vital for our health, but our needs change throughout our lives. Experts reveal how to maximise the benefits for everyone</p><p>The fundamental purpose of sleep is to “service” our brains so they’re in good working order for the gargantuan tasks we require of them: so it makes perfect sense that babies – whose brains are doing the most demanding work a human brain will ever do – need a lot of sleep. Newborns tend to spend more time asleep than awake (as much as 18 hours in 24), but all babies are different – and their needs change all the time – so don’t worry too much about their sleeping patterns. “The rule of thumb is so long as they’re alert and happy when they’re awake, then they’re getting enough sleep,” says Professor Helen Ball, director of the<a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/disc" title=""> Durham Infancy &amp; Sleep Centre</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/31/how-to-sleep-well-health-experts-age-babies-parents">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Propaganda literature’: calls to close Mikhail Bulgakov museum in Kyiv

<p>The Master and Margarita writer’s antipathy to Ukrainian nationalism has led to some demanding his old house be renamed or repurposed</p><p>In his novel The White Guard, Mikhail Bulgakov painted an evocative portrait of his childhood home. Inside, there was a Dutch stove blazing with heat, a piano and a library, and cream-coloured curtains. The family’s first-floor apartment was located in “a two-storey house of strikingly unusual design”. In winter, the snow topping the roof resembled “a White general’s fur cap” – a reference to the anti-Bolshevik White movement.</p><p>But Bulgakov’s house in Kyiv is now at the centre of a bitter public dispute. In Soviet times it became a literary museum. Ukraine’s national writers’ union has called for the museum at number 13A Andriivskyi Descent – a historic cobbled street linking the upper town with the district of Podil, on the banks of the Dnipro River – to be closed down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/31/mikhail-bulgakov-museum-kyiv-calls-to-close">Continue reading...</a>

It’s usually sour from tamarind and tomatoes, but also brothy, spiced and herbal. All of these qualities make it restoring and enlivening: I feel as though I can see more clearly after eating it. My rasam has the same essential qualities as the original, but I’ve adapted it to Britain’s colder weather. I’ve given it more substance by using split peas and sweet pumpkin, which means it can be eaten by itself or with rice – as opposed to part of a main meal, which is how it would be eaten in India.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/31/pumpkin-rasam-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

## Do you get ‘hangxiety’? How to cope with an anxious hangover

<p>We expect a sore head after a big night out, but the accompanying anxiety is harder to cope with. Why do we get ‘prangovers’, and how do we alleviate them? We ask the experts</p><p>You’ve got a raging thirst but you can’t drag yourself out of bed for a glass of water. All you remember from last night is going off on one about a man who “hatfished” you on a date while wearing a cap, only to realise the guy listening to you was heavily receding. None of your friends have messaged you this morning so you assume they must hate you now. You lie in the foetal position and kid yourself into believing you are still asleep so you don’t have to deal with the consequences of your actions. You have “hangxiety” (hangover anxiety) or you are suffering from a “prangover” (pranging out hungover), and it’s the worst feeling in the world.</p><p>There’s a scientific reason why drinking makes us feel like this. “Alcohol is one of the most promiscuous of drugs, in that it affects a lot of different types of receptors and hence the majority, if not all, of the neurons,” says David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London and author of 2020 book Drink?

<p>Since taking this self-portrait, the photographer says her life has been transformed by motherhood</p><p>When Tinatin Jabanashvili began studying law in her home town of Tbilisi, Georgia, she left her passions of dancing and acting behind. Photography, she says, took their place; a way to express her feelings, and how she saw the world, without words.</p><p>Having completed her master’s, she now works in HR in the parliament of Georgia. “My work is very interesting, but very corporate. My art is what fills me with freedom.” Her biggest passion, however, arrived six months ago, in the form of a little girl called Elene. “She’s my first child, and has become my biggest and best inspiration. Before, it was people, streets, shadows and sunshine, but now I’m at home raising my child I’m grateful for every minute, for all the new things she’s doing,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/31/tinatin-jabanashvili-best-phone-picture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A tasty winter main or a standout  side dish to impress the family</p><p>I’ve been having an argument with my family for years. It has become as much of a tradition for us as mince pies or Mariah Carey and it revolves around stuffing. They insist that the packet stuff is good enough for them, and no amount of my homemade stuffing, with pork sausagemeat, chestnuts, cranberries and orange zest, can convince them otherwise. So this year, in the spirit of festive magnanimity, I’m forgoing it altogether. Instead, I’ve come up with this, a kind of dauphinoise made with parsnips and chicken that could standout as a new side dish for celebratory meals. Wish me luck with the family critics!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/31/parsnip-chicken-dauphinoise-recipe-tamal-ray">Continue reading...</a>

Still, there are reasons to be hopeful. That same energy crisis has spurred an unprecedented demand for renewables, which are expected to boom, while in Brazil, a new president has sworn to protect the Amazon.

After completing a theatre studies course, she landed her debut role aged 20 in the film <em>Rita, Sue and Bob Too</em>.

Instead, she burned the macho guy to a crisp in nine words.</p><p>Cars are routinely tokens of virility and status for men, and the image accompanying his tweet of him pumping gas into one of his vehicles, coupled with his claims about their “enormous emissions”, had unsolicited dick pic energy.

<p> With a few simple strokes, these clever highlighters can add the perfect evening gleam – and liven up a wintry pallor</p><p>I like highlighter almost as little as I like lipgloss. There’s something about that obvious, aggressively shimmery powder look that I associate – a little too strongly – with early Instagram and it already felt dated back then. If I ever do add gleam to the face’s high plains, it will always be with cream highlighter rather than powder (<a href="https://www.roseinc.co.uk/" title="">Rose Inc</a> makes the best), but I’m not an instinctive lover of everyday shimmer.</p><p>A <em>glass </em>highlighter is a whole other story – especially now that they’re easier to find. Instead of dry glittery particles, glass highlighters give a subtly light-reflecting, almost wet-looking gleam that looks and feels – at least to me – way more sophisticated and less “night on the razz”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/31/for-a-subtle-less-on-the-razz-gleam-try-a-glass-highlighter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s time to embrace positivity – from the underdog idealism of Rocky to the transcendent A Matter of Life and Death and the gloriously morbid optimism of Harold and Maude</p><p>New Year’s Day: too late for year-end reflections but too early, as we all blearily nurse our prosecco hangovers, to charge forth into a new-release calendar. Rather, January is a month when I tend to gravitate towards old favourites, but not the sentimental nostalgia of Christmas time. Instead, I seek out the hopeful, the optimistic, the forward-looking – films on which to build a new outlook.</p><p>The genre of films that tick those boxes without sinking into drippy inspirational territory – or more simple feelgood fare – is a rather specific one, though it can encompass extravagant fantasy and downhome realism. The first and most straightforwardly uplifting film I thought of for my new year playlist was <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/search?q=rocky">Rocky</a></strong>, a popular phenomenon from 1976 that has been so obscured by its subsequent sequels and mythos that people tend to forget what a plain, earnest and pure-hearted little film it is. It’s an underdog story that gets you high on the possibility of achieving anything, brings you down to reality a little bit, and finally reminds you that reality can be pretty good anyway. It encapsulates the spirit of realistic idealism I want for 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/31/streaming-the-best-hopeful-films-for-a-new-year">Continue reading...</a>

## No one is safe until everyone is safe – we applied it to the pandemic, but why not our economy? | Rowan Williams

<p>A ‘cost of living crisis’ is a sign our society has gone fundamentally wrong. It’s time we stopped reducing people to calculations of cost</p><p>A few weeks ago, a friend reminded me of that old song, All My Trials: “If living were a thing that money could buy / The rich would live and the poor would die.” Which, of course, they do. Just how many unnecessary deaths will result from the lethal combination of extreme cold and soaring energy costs this winter remains to be seen, but no one needs an economics degree to work out that the figures will be weighted towards those who lack choices and resources. </p><p>It is not just that insecurity literally threatens lives; it is also that all those things financial security makes possible – the freedom to celebrate, to plan for your children, to give gifts to people you love – become monstrously complicated. Living with any fullness or imagination recedes over the horizon when choices are all about survival. Who goes hungry – you, or your child? How many jobs can you take on to keep the family fed without wrecking your physical and mental health?</p><p>Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of Canterbury</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/31/safe-pandemic-economy-cost-of-living-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

As I set out along the coastal path from Penzance to Marazion, it’s a surreal view. The mount, with its collar of gold-flecked water, looks like it’s levitating. The podcast I’m listening to is telling me that the mount is also surrounded by a submerged forest.

<p>It’s not easy being a ‘good’ person – what can we learn from the people who have thought about it the most?</p><p><br /></p><p>I used to think I was a good person. I was caring to my friends, my partner, my family; I gave to charity and I volunteered; I wasn’t racist, homophobic or sexist. Boxes: ticked. But when I started training to become a therapist<strong> </strong>in the NHS, I began to understand that however much we might like to think of ourselves as good people, we don’t actually know ourselves very well. We don’t know what’s really going on under the surface; why we do the things we do.</p><p>I learned about how we might, without consciously realising it, deny the feelings and motivations we consider to be bad, pushing them down into our unconscious and projecting them out on to others, so they become the bad people. I learned that deep in the human psyche, alongside love and kindness, run currents of rage, need, greed, envy, destructiveness, superiority – whether we want to acknowledge them or not. Goodness me, I thought. How terrible – for everybody else. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/31/how-can-you-be-the-best-parent-lover-friend-citizen">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Long Dean, Cotswolds:</strong> Before dawn I’m out feeding the cattle, deep in the seasonal routine</p><p>It is the final day of the year, but the farming cycle, governed by season and not calendar, makes the significance of tomorrow almost arbitrary. Not until the herd is on spring grass, new calves “at foot”, will it feel as if we have truly turned a corner. Now we are deep into winter, with its unchanging daily routine, and I am out before it is light, as I have been each and every day – Christmas included – since the cattle became dependent on supplementary feeding. They are waiting for me, just as they always are, for the most part stoically patient, but one or two with a peremptory shout. Devons are known for being vocal.</p><p>The bull, true to character, stands silent. Head raised expectantly, he raises it a little higher as he scents his breakfast. I toss the bale into the ring feeder and climb in after it. A steer pushes forward, catching his hoof on the rim with jarring metallic clunk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/31/country-diary-the-farm-rolls-on-regardless-of-day-or-year">Continue reading...</a>
