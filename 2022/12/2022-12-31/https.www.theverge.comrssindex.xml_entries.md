  <p id="JU9T7t">It’s well and truly curtains for 3G, one of the key technologies that helped usher in the age of the smartphone. Throughout December, Verizon has been disconnecting its customers who were still using the tech, cutting off their phones’ ability to use data, make calls, and send texts. It was the last major US carrier to do so — <a href="https://www.cepro.com/security/alarms-sensors/att-suggests-temporary-workaround-to-3g-sunset/">AT&amp;T turned off its 3G service</a> in February, and T-Mobile <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23002956/tmobile-shutdown-date-push-back-sprint-3g-dcma-network-dish">started winding its old networks down</a> the month after.</p>
<p id="2LY4cF">Verizon customers with 3G devices have had plenty of warning. It previously said the network would be going offline in 2019, but with one delay after another, the date has slowly been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022">pushed back to December 31st, 2022</a>. In the meantime, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200109/verizon-free-4g-lte-flip-phones-3g-customers">sent people new, LTE-capable phones</a>, as well as letters...</p>

  <p id="lijWpR">A new leak could confirm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446875/nvidia-rtx-4080-12gb-return-rtx-4070-ti-rumor">rumors that Nvidia’s planning on releasing</a> the “unlaunched” 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card as the RTX 4070 Ti. The company briefly posted the specs for its upcoming RTX 4070 Ti GPU on its website, but <a href="https://twitter.com/momomo_us/status/1608743452904390656?s=20&amp;t=AEJWayw0DTGAQA0gW2GY0A">Twitter user @momomo_us</a> managed to snag a screenshot before Nvidia pulled <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F40-series%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F12%2F31%2F23533423%2Fnvidia-rtx-4070-ti-leak-specs-unlaunched-12gb-4080" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the page</a> down.</p>
<p id="fY2Knd">So far, the leaked specs look identical to that of the 12GB RTX 4080, with the chip sporting 7,680 CUDA cores, a 2.61 GHz boost clock, and 12GB of memory. It also says the GPU could run 4K at up to 240Hz or 8K at 60Hz with DSC and HDR, while an included chart indicates that the RTX 4070 Ti could outperform the RTX 3080 by about 3.5 times when playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with its <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode/">new Ray-Tracing: Overdrive mode</a>.</p>
