My most used VR application is by far, VRChat- also one of the most widely used VR apps across PCVR and Quest / Quest 2. Most recently a massive issue has come up with predators within the application taking advantage of the newly found young userbase. \n\nThe problem here is.. nobody really knows what VRChat is. Parents.. news.. nobody except for its users. SO, here's my attempt to spread some awareness- hopefully if you know someone that needs to hear this, you send them this video. the knowledge could potentially save lives. \n\nLets work towards a better and safer VR community moving forward. \n\nINTERNET SAFETY RESOURCES: \nhttps://protectchildren.ca/en/resources-research/online-safety/\nhttps://t.co/9JeBeu5mKL (XR CHILD SAFETY INITIATIVE)\n\nMETA AND QUEST 2 PARENTAL FEATURES:\nhttps://www.meta.com/ca/quest/safety-center/parental-supervision/\n\nMy links:\nTwitch:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nMy discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/2hCGM9BYez\nPatreon link:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nOUTRO MUSIC:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Jwg...", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSbdMXOI_3HGiFviLZO6kNA", "title": "Thrillseeker"}}
