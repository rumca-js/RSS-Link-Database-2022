In part 7 of Jordan Peterson’s Exodus series, the table discusses chapters fifteen through eighteen, specifically, God parting the Red Sea, Moses leading the Israelites out of tyranny, Pharaoh’s Egyptian army dissolving, the influence memorizing the Israelite song had on their perspective, and God providing mercy and nourishment through manna in response to hunger with the exception of the Sabbath. The scholars address the right hand of God, study of science as an apprenticeship, crossover of order and chaos, freely chosen consent, plagues brought about by tyranny, prayer and daily remembrance, and the human condition.
