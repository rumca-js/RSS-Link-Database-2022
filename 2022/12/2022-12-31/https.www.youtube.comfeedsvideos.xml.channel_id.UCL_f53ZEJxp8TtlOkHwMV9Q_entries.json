The scholars address the right hand of God, study of science as an apprenticeship, crossover of order and chaos, freely chosen consent, plagues brought about by tyranny, prayer and daily remembrance, and the human condition.\n\nWatch Exodus: https://bit.ly/3IfZbA6\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #exodus #bible #psychology", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "title": "Jordan B Peterson"}}
