As a cartoonist, I try my best to create cartoons that measure up to the old adage, "a picture is worth a thousand words." That does happen. There are times when everything comes together perfectly: a brilliant insight (if I do say so myself), a great composition, an arresting drawing, and ideally, a laugh or a snort. Many times though, I might not hit that high target and my visual commentary is perhaps worth merely hundreds of words — but hey, in baseball, batting .500 is still really good. So with that in mind, I offer you a gallery of what I think are my better efforts, a selection of my personal cartoon commentary from 2022 that I hope is worth a thousand words, but I'll leave the scoring to you.
