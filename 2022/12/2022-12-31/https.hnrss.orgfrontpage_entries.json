calls for tech unionization?", "description": "<p>For years, the idea of unionizing software engineers and other tech workers has been mostly a fringe idea. While there have been some high-profile examples such as the Kickstarter union and organizing in the notoriously cutthroat video games industry, the idea has been largely scoffed at. The idea is that because SWEs are in such hot demand, it is one of the very few examples where employment relations benefit workers greatly.<p>Now with large scale layoffs already and who knows what else on the horizon, it seems like that leverage, once present during the low interest rates environment of the pandemic bubble, is fast disappearing. So does that vindicate the idea that tech workers should have codified the benefits they enjoyed during the good times, through unionizing?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I designed this Pole Clock to be a helpful tool for people like myself who often struggle with managing their sense of time.<p>I found that analog clocks are generally easier to read and understand than digital ones, however I find the fact that every day is broken into two 12-hour rotations unintuitive. A single 24-hour rotation makes it easier to grasp where in the day you are, the bottom half representing night and the top half representing day.<p>Additionally, because the clock displays 24 hours, you can add extra hour hands on the clock for other time zones. This is especially useful if you work remotely or have friends and colleagues in different time zones. At a single glance, see where they are in their days and energy levels!<p>I hope you'll give the Pole Clock a try and find that it helps you better understand and manage your sense of time.</p>\n<hr

At first, I thought I had mistakenly accepted an invite to their project. However, I swore that wasn\u2019t the case. To test my theory, I tried creating an empty project and invited my other Google account to it. I discovered that Google Cloud lets you add any email to a project without getting their permission or notifying them. Google doesn\u2019t even send an email asking you to accept the invitation. It just adds you automatically without telling you. The end result is you can quite literally just type in any Google Cloud account and associate it with your project without them ever knowing.<p>The worst part is that you can\u2019t leave the project after you\u2019re added. Google requires the project owner remove you. They provide no way to remove yourself. I\u2019ve tried contacting the company that added me but they\u2019ve not responded to my requests.<p>I also tried contacting Google support and they\u2019ve been less than helpful. At first, they thought that my account was hacked. I pointed out that this was not due to a hack, but due to Google\u2019s faulty invite system. They responded back and said they didn\u2019t see any association between my email and the project. So they listed the case as resolved and said they couldn\u2019t discuss any further details about the project. This is despite the fact the unwanted project still appears on my GCP dashboard. I suspect they didn\u2019t see any association because they were just checking the projects owned by my account and not checking projects I\u2019ve been added to.<p>This whole situation seems like a recipe for unwanted spam since you can be added to projects without permission and can\u2019t ever remove yourself. My biggest fear is if that company uses the project to do something malicious then my account might be banned by association. Overall, this is a major oversight on Google\u2019s side and is a huge security and privacy risk.<p>To date, I\u2019ve still been unable to get any help from Google to resolve this issue. If there\u2019s any Googlers willing to help, I would be extremely grateful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34193047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34193047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34193047", "date_published": "2022-12-31 02:57:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Louis Rossmann discusses NY's butchering of right to repair [video]", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9kXnm9uW5k\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9kXnm9uW5k</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34192874\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34192874</a></p>\n<p>Points: 101</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9kXnm9uW5k", "date_published": "2022-12-31 02:31:29+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["louis rossmann", "right to repair", "corporatocracy"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: What is your new year's resolution?", "description": "<p>What do you plan to achieve this year?
