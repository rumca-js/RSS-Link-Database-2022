There are times when everything comes together perfectly: a brilliant insight (if I do say so myself), a great composition, an arresting drawing, and ideally, a laugh or a snort. Many times though, I might not hit that high target and my visual commentary is perhaps worth merely hundreds of words \u2014 but hey, in baseball, batting .500 is still really good. So with that in mind, I offer you a gallery of what I think are my better efforts, a selection of my personal cartoon commentary from 2022 that I hope is worth a thousand words, but I'll leave the scoring to you.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/gallery/2022/12/31/politico-matt-wuerker-best-cartoons-2022-00075843", "date_published": "2022-12-31 04:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
