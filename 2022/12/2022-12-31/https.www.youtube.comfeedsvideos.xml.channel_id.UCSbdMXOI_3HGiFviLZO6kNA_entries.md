Hello. 

Today I am breaking down an issue that we have all seen develop across social VR apps. My most used VR application is by far, VRChat- also one of the most widely used VR apps across PCVR and Quest / Quest 2. Most recently a massive issue has come up with predators within the application taking advantage of the newly found young userbase. 

The problem here is.. nobody really knows what VRChat is. Parents.. news.. nobody except for its users. SO, here's my attempt to spread some awareness- hopefully if you know someone that needs to hear this, you send them this video. the knowledge could potentially save lives. 

Lets work towards a better and safer VR community moving forward.
