The content is broken down into three divisions. You have the overall catchweight division, where all beatdowns and silliness are <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fast-food-counter-hands" target="_blank">ranked on a pound-for-pound</a> basis. Waffle House, of course, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-cook-shares-story" target="_blank">gets its own division</a>. And then there's McDonalds. Which, unlike the regionally located Waffle House, is global.</p><p>It could <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-employee-fight" target="_blank">pop off in America</a>. Russian aficionados of McFlurries discover the hard way <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-russian-handcuffed" target="_blank">that the War in Ukraine has gone too far</a>. And in Australia, a woman who isn't getting what she perceives to be proper service takes matters into her own hands.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@bae_angle_/video/7182556361815805186" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bae_angle_?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@bae_angle_">@bae_angle_</a> Adelaide ü§¶üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7182556422645844738?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="‚ô¨ original sound - Angle">‚ô¨ original sound - Angle</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>The instigating action is unknown. I suppose it is within the realm of possibility that something was said to this woman to justify wilding out and making her own sandwich.</p><p>Rules are once you cross the counter, you're in their world and employees are allowed to start throwing hands. But this woman wasn't violent as much as angry. I'm guessing chemically altered too. At that point, if I'm working I'm letting her have the run of the place while I take my fifteen-minute break. Or take out my camera for when she does something internet worthy. They have managers to handle the crazy people. I'm only there to flip burgers and tell people the soft-serve ice cream machine is still broken.</p><p>Unfortunately, for all the trouble that went into making her own McCrazy sandwich, she never got to eat it. The law caught up with her and she was removed from the premises. She's Burger King's problem now.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk embraces his inner edgelord as he points out how 'creepy' Anthony Fauci is

Fauci, the man who is literally The Science, has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/us/politics/anthony-fauci-retirement.html" target="_blank">New York Times profile</a> that Elon finds "creepy."</p><p>The first two paragraphs are all you need to know. It concerns how much Fauci enjoys looking at himself. "<em>The walls in Dr. Anthony S. Fauci‚Äôs home office are adorned with portraits of him, drawn and painted by some of his many fans. The most striking one is by the singer Joan Baez.... Fauci seemed a little uncomfortable with people knowing about the pictures. He said that previously when they were captured on camera, the 'far right' attacked him as an 'egomaniac.' </em>(Editor's Note: Fact check TRUE) <em>If someone goes to the trouble of sending him a portrait of himself, he said, he would 'feel like I‚Äôm disrespecting them‚Äù </em><em>if he discarded it."</em></p><p>If you find it creepy for Anthony "the Scienece" Fauci, or any adult to have a room just of pictures of himself, you are not alone.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Maybe he just loves looking at science?<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608799144117940224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon has been embracing his inner edgelord <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-top-tweet" target="_blank">ever since rumors broke of him buying Twitter</a>. Musk is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hooters-elon-musk" target="_blank">ending the year</a> with great aplomb. Making it a point to drop a deuce on everything the people who worship Tony "The Science" believes. One sh*tposting meme at a time.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/RheEuBzGqj">pic.twitter.com/RheEuBzGqj</a><br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608188826291167242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">If you don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs at least a tiny chance you‚Äôre an NPC ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre an NPC<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608939190548598784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I‚Äôm not brainwashed!! <a href="https://t.co/4kx61uu4yy">pic.twitter.com/4kx61uu4yy</a><br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1607997591870124032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the thing with Elon. His commitment to free speech is admirable. He has made Twitter fun again. And the traffic any post about his shenanigans drives to the website has increased my bourbon collection exponentially. HOWEVER, some of his tweets, to me at least, can fall between "trying too hard" and "saying sh*t just for the engagement." </p><p>How much he means everything he tweets, I'm not sure. It's a safe bet when it comes to what he believes on an issue-by-issue basis, he's more WEF that he is CPAC. It would behoove my conservative colleagues to keep this in mind for when he starts saying stuff we disagree with. It's going to happen sooner than later.</p><p>Until that time though, it's all still entertaining AF. Revel in the content. We'll worry about calling him a sellout when the time comes.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Our favorite Waffle House employee, the chick with the chair, shares her version of events and it's glorious

She took to YouTube to provide her new legions of adoring fans with her version of events. Turns out, this incident popped off in September 2021 and Halie left the company shortly after. Ackshually, it's Halie's story to tell.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</small>
</p><p>The backstory is exactly what you would expect. It was well past midnight. The aggressors were sh*tfaced and demanded service right away. They were rude to the staff. The staff clapped back and asked the unruly customers to leave. This is where things popped off because, as Halie points out, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-upside-down" target="_blank">it's just what happens</a> at the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-tampa-viral" target="_blank">Waffle House</a>.</p><blockquote>[The aggressor] was  still jacking the jaw, "I'mma beat your ass." if you're feeling froggy, jump. That's how night shift works. And it's sad because there's no security guards. There are guns that get pulled at Waffle House. There's bullet holes in some Waffle Houses that I've worked at. Like, people deadass popped off at these places. It's not safe at night so we have to do what we can.</blockquote><p>Halie also echoed a warning we at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website have. Never, no matter how angry you are, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fast-food-counter-hands" target="_blank">cross over the counter</a>. Once you do, you're in their world and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/popeyes-fight" target="_blank">bad things happen</a>.</p><blockquote><span></span>That's when the girl with the dreads stands up. She comes on our side of the counter. Now, if you come on our side of the counter, there's tile there. It changes from tile to like this bumpy dark floor. If you put your foot both feet on the other side or even a single foot on the other side of that floor, we can do anything. We can do legally in our means, whatever means necessary, to remove you or ensure our safety. Whether means taking one of the cast iron pans and hitting you upside the motherf*cking head with it. or beating the fuck out of you when you fall over. You touch my floor, it's on.</blockquote><p>Police eventually responded and the aggressors were made to leave with no arrest made. Though, there WERE arrests made at this same Waffle House later on. Unrelated to this chaos, it turns out the manager and one other employee got caught in a version of credit card fraud and cheating waitresses out of tips.</p><p>Once leaving this Waffle House, Halie was blacklisted from working in any other one. Sad, because besides being a rockstar cook, she can train other employees in Waffle House's unique fighting style. Let's hope her newfound viral superstardom helps mend any hard feelings between the two parties.</p><p><p>
