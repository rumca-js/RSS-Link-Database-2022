On Friday, the company <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-appoints-hubert-h-lee-to-lead-its-mx-design-team\"><ins>announced</ins></a> the appointment of Hubert H. Lee to head up its Mobile eXperience (MX) Design Team, the unit responsible for designing some of Samsung\u2019s most visible products, including its flagship Galaxy S series phones. Lee joins the electronics giant after a stint as the chief design officer of Mercedes-Benz China, a position that saw him lead the automaker\u2019s design teams in China and the US. \u201cHis unique and visionary perspective will help shape the look and feel of Galaxy, building on the distinct design ethos that users know and love,\u201d Samsung said.</p><p>It will probably be at least a year before we see Lee start to leave his mark on Samsung\u2019s products. <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-3177601/\"><ins>Prelease leaks</ins></a> of the company\u2019s next Galaxy S series phones suggest they\u2019ll look a lot like their Galaxy S22 predecessors.

Still, Lee could push for small but meaningful tweaks to Samsung's design formula \u2014 much like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-hardware-design-leader-evans-hankey-leaves-155100957.html\">Evans Hankey</a> did at Apple after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-jony-ive-lovefrom.html\">Jony Ive's departure</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsung-appoints-hubert-h-lee-design-chief-221014832.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-31 22:10:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Today is the last day to use Dark Sky on iOS before it shuts down", "description": "<p>The time has come to say goodbye to Dark Sky.
