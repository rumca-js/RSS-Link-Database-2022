The rifle has been a huge influence on firearms history, as well as having a recurring role in World War 2 games like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty. And while often one of the most powerful entries in the arsenal of those video games, does the truth of this historic weapon match up to its on-screen legacy, and does its appearance in games today still kick up a storm? \n\n0:00 - Intro\n00:47 - History of the STG 44\n03:47 - Is it the first assault rifle?\n05:17 - STG 44 in Pop Culture\n07:48 - STG 44 in Call of Duty franchise\n08:57 - Pop Culture Tropes\n12:53 - The Legacy of the STG 44\n15:00 - Ending\n\nIn this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chat about the world\u2019s first assault rifle, the STG 44.\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Loadout right here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSrmGkpWKk&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMzIemU1gyyLmg5VlKI2UvC\n\nYou can check out our Firearms Expert Reacts series here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FVzcoRjoN4&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve98EIQX_S8", "date_published": "2022-12-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best PC Games 2022", "description": "Here are our five best PC games of 2022 and five honorable mentions that you should check out ASAP.\n\nThe PC gaming ecosystem is easily the largest in the industry, with tens of thousands of games available to play. Not only that, unlike Switch or PlayStation, there isn't exactly a \"first-party\" publisher on PC, which means there are few true marquee exclusive games on the platform. Therefore, this list of the year's five best PC games naturally features games you'll sometimes (though not always) find elsewhere, but in cases where multiplatform games appear, we believe they're best played on PC and deserve a spot on this list. This year's list is an eclectic bunch, too, with a speedrunning gem, a deep detective-like experience, and a physics playground all earning top spots.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ckBPejAqgU", "date_published": "2022-12-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Bonelab\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down more of the weaponry of Bonelab, including the Benelli M4 shotgun being used in tandem with a shield, and AKM being used as a club, as well as the M1 Garand, and a Micro-Uzi.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:51 - AKM\n04:07 - Using an AK as a club\n04:59 - Skeleton using a Remington 870\n06:29 - Micro-Uzi\n07:31 - M1 Garand\n09:05 - AR15\n11:23 - KRISS Vector-\n12:40 - Ruger Mk III\n14:07 - Benelli M4 Shotgun\n16:11 - Shotgun & Shield\n24:48 - Ending\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Bonelab and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\n\nLink to Lam0rak's mod map used in the episode https://mod.io/g/bonelab/m/genesismesa\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALVAP0DNyE", "date_published": "2022-12-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
