<p>Nothing is reportedly preparing to release a pair of true wireless headphones under a new flanker brand. Digging through the company’s latest firmware, <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1604080280339464192?s=20&amp;t=biVC8PMgz8gaVgPIa94qRQ"><ins>developer Kuba Wojciechowski</ins></a> (via <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nothing-particles-by-xo-sub-brand-tws-earbuds-first-look-exclusive/"><em><ins>91mobiles</ins></em></a>) found evidence of an unreleased set of “Particles by XO” earbuds.</p><figure><img alt="Particles by XO" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/49228210-7e5d-11ed-bff4-4929e54c4f39" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">91mobiles</div></figure><p>Renders of the headphones showcase a unique design that’s reminiscent of a peanut or molecular chain. According to Wojciechowski, the earbuds include LHDC codec support and active noise cancelation. In other words, it looks like Nothing is preparing a product that has traits from both its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html"><ins>Ear 1</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-stick-wireless-buds-pricing-release-date-availability-143040910.html"><ins>Ear Stick</ins></a> wireless buds. There are a few bits of evidence linking the earbuds to Nothing. To start, the company’s internal codename for them is “B154.” Nothing has reportedly used a similar codename, B155, for its upcoming Ear 2 headphones. On Saturday, the <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/90717693"><ins>US Patent and Trademark Office</ins></a> awarded a shell company called “The Most Unknown LLC” a trademark for “Particles by XO.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for why Nothing, a company with only three products to its name, would establish a new brand just to launch another pair of wireless earbuds, it’s probably another marketing scheme by the company’s founder, former OnePlus executive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/interview-with-nothing-ceo-carl-pei-thinks-everyone-elses-smartphones-are-boring-090011028.html"><ins>Carl Pei</ins></a>.</p>

## California invests $2.6 billion to build 90,000 EV chargers

<p>The California Energy Commission (CEC) will spend $2.9 billion to accelerate the state’s zero-emission transportation strategy. In an <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2022-12/cec-approves-29-billion-investment-zero-emission-transportation-infrastructure"><ins>announcement</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-approves-29-bln-investment-double-car-chargers-state-2022-12-15/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the agency detailed an investment plan it estimated would result in California building about 90,000 new chargers over the next four years, a move that would more than double the <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/zero-emission-vehicle-and-infrastructure-statistics/electric-vehicle">number of chargers</a> available across the state.</p><p>About $900 million will go toward chargers designed for light-duty EVs, with another $1.7 billion earmarked for infrastructure that supports medium and heavy-duty zero-emissions vehicles, including those powered by hydrogen fuel cells. When you add in funding from utilities and other programs, the commission says it expects California to hit its goal of deploying 250,000 chargers by 2025.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This transformative investment will deploy charging and refueling infrastructure swiftly and equitably to make sure drivers of zero-emission cars and trucks feel confident they can refuel wherever they go,” said CEC Lead Commissioner for Transportation Patty Monahan. “The plan will increase access to charging and hydrogen fueling for individuals, businesses and public agencies, while supporting our emerging manufacturing ecosystem and creating jobs.”</p><p>Building enough charging infrastructure to support a growing number of EVs will be critical to California’s climate change plan. Earlier this year, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html"><ins>following an order from Governor Gavin Newsom</ins></a>, said it would require all cars sold in the state by 2035 to be either fully electric or plug-in hybrids. More recently, the agency approved a <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/carb-approves-historic-26-billion-investment-largest-date-clean-cars-trucks-mobility-options"><ins>$2.6 billion</ins></a> investment to incentivize consumers and companies to switch to electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but Elon Musk has reportedly laid off more of Twitter’s workforce. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdHdpdHRlci1sYXlzLW9mZi1lbmdpbmVlcnMtaW4taW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtb3JnLWRheXMtYWZ0ZXItbGVhZGVycy13ZXJlLWZpcmVkP3JjPXdoZjBmZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTE1ZDI1ZjEtN2FmMS00OGNmLTkwMzMtNzYxN2Y3YjdlZTliIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfprxeh_wJU2x7cq_wDsEw04gSXZiAdTgC0WQUxknq2d&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ftwitter-lays-off-engineers-in-infrastructure-org-days-after-leaders-were-fired%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd"><em><ins>The Information</ins></em></a>, the company cut part of its infrastructure division on Friday evening. The scale of the layoffs is unclear, but some engineers took to Twitter yesterday to say they were told over email their contribution was no longer required. The latest cuts come after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-alex-spiro-232831688.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported on Tuesday that Musk had laid off Nelson Abramson, Twitter’s head of infrastructure, among a handful of other high-ranking employees at the company.</p><div id="a2b0cc164e71483985d883c53067239e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">And that was my last day at Twitter.

The company has not had a communications team since it began reducing its workforce. By <em>The Information</em>’s estimate, Twitter’s headcount has shrunk by about 75 percent since Musk’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html"><ins>takeover of the company in late October</ins></a>. The social media website employed approximately 7,500 under <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-messages-jack-dorsey-parag-agrawal-000254423.html"><ins>former CEO Parag Agrawal</ins></a>. As of a week ago, Twitter’s internal Slack listed around 2,000 employees, according to the outlet. In November, Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html"><ins>reportedly told</ins></a> what was left of the company’s workforce Twitter would not lay off any more workers. The pledge came after the billionaire’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hit-with-mass-resignations-after-elon-musk-hardcore-ultimatum-004304057.html"><ins>“extremely hardcore” ultimatum</ins></a> led to at least 1,200 resignations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additional casualties among the team responsible for keeping Twitter up and running are likely to add to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/08/1062886/heres-how-a-twitter-engineer-says-it-will-break-in-the-coming-weeks/"><ins>fears</ins></a> about how unreliable the site may become in the near future.

According to <em>The Information</em>, Musk tapped Tesla engineer Sheen Austin to run the social media website’s infrastructure team following Abramson’s departure.</p><p>The layoffs also point to the seemingly precarious financial position Twitter has found itself in since Musk’s takeover. In recent weeks, Elon and other executives reportedly discussed the potential consequences of denying severance payments to the thousands of people who were let go from the company in recent weeks. The company is also behind on rent for its San Fransisco headquarters and network of global satellite offices.</p>

## Apple has reportedly dropped out of NFL Sunday Ticket negotiations

<p>In 2021, Apple was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nfl-apple-sunday-ticket-directv-193022880.html"><ins>considered the frontrunner</ins></a> to secure streaming rights to the National Football League’s Sunday Ticket package. Now, a year later, the company has reportedly dropped out of negotiations. The tidbit comes from a <a href="https://puck.news/iger-expectations-the-espn-x-factor/?_cio_id=f6c6060094639563&amp;utm_campaign=In+The+Room+-+SUBSCRIBERS+%2812%2F16%2F22%29&amp;utm_content=In+The+Room+-+SUBSCRIBERS+%2812%2F16%2F22%29&amp;utm_medium=email_action&amp;utm_source=customer.io"><em><ins>Puck</ins></em><ins> article</ins></a> about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bob-iger-is-returning-as-disney-ceo-in-a-huge-shakeup-065239929.html"><ins>Bob Iger’s surprise return to Disney</ins></a>. According to author Dylan Byers, Apple recently said no to the NFL “not because they can’t afford [the package], but because they don’t see the logic.”</p><p>With Disney reportedly bowing out of the negations as well, the talks have become a two-horse race between Amazon and Google. “Amazon can use [the deal] to drive Prime subscriptions; Google can use it to fuel its YouTube TV business,” adds Byers. Of the two suitors, Amazon is probably the best fit given that Prime Video is the exclusive home of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-thursday-night-football-2022-season-184224274.html"><ins>Thursday Night Football</ins></a> for the next decade.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Last year, <em>The Athletic</em> reported the NFL was asking for more than $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket rights, a price that was at least $500 million more than what  DirecTV had been paying to air Sunday games. In a press conference earlier this week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Sunday Ticket negotiations were at “<a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/12/14/roger-goodell-sunday-ticket-negotiations-are-at-a-very-critical-point/">a very critical point</a>” for the league. That seems to have been an understatement.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-files-011249897.html">Twitter</a> has announced through its Safety account that it has &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/twittersafety/status/1603960041463492608">identified several policies</a> where permanent suspension was a disproportionate action for breaking Twitter rules.&quot; The website has already started reinstating accounts that were suspended for violating those rules, the tweet continued, and it will lift more suspensions every week over the next month. Twitter didn't specify the policies it's talking about and which accounts will be reinstated. But upon checking, the accounts of <a href="https://twitter.com/joinmastodon">Mastodon</a> and the journalists recently banned due to the website's new doxxing rules are up and running again.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand what happened, we have to go back a few days. The website banned several accounts over the past week, starting with @ElonJet, the account that tracked flights of Elon Musk's private jet using publicly available data. Other accounts that also tracked the planes of government agencies and high-profile individuals were banned, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On his account, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603190155107794944">announced</a> that any account &quot;doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended.&quot; In a follow-up tweet, he said that a car carrying his child was &quot;followed by crazy stalker&quot; and that he was taking legal action against Jack Sweeney, the college student who ran @ElonJet, and &quot;organizations who supported harm to [his] family.&quot; As of this writing, the @ElonJet account is still suspended.&nbsp;</p><div id="fd2c73c763414e00ba6235167c4768aa"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve identified several policies where permanent suspension was a disproportionate action for breaking Twitter rules.

It's worth noting that Twitter seems to have <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1602857445818339329">started flagging posts</a> containing the word &quot;Mastodon&quot; as &quot;sensitive content&quot; days before this happened. Users also found themselves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/elon-musk-suspends-mastodon-twitter-account-over-elonjet-tracking/">unable to post links to Mastodon</a> servers.</p><p>In addition to Mastodon, Twitter suspended the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-journalists-who-cover-elon-musk-015038157.html">accounts of several journalists</a> who report on Elon Musk and the social network itself. Most of them talked about Sweeney or linked to @ElonJet in some way, and based on <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603575877538680832">Musk's responses</a> to questions about the event, the journalists were suspended due to Twitter's new doxxing rules. One of the banned journalists, <em>The Washington Post's</em> Drew Harwell, posted a screenshot of the tweet that the website had flagged for doxxing: It was a report about Mastodon's suspension for tweeting a link to it service's own @ElonJet account.</p><div id="322c1f72ba904019ada14b3ddbd2e8bb"><div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@drewharwell/109527398462508424"></a></div></div></div><p>Following the journalists' suspensions, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603609466301059073">posted a poll</a> asking people whether he should reinstate the accounts of users who doxxed his exact location in real time &quot;now&quot; or &quot;in 7 days.&quot; The &quot;now&quot; option won, and Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603982891179839488">promised</a> that those accounts will be restored.

<p>John Carmack, the virtual reality pioneer who joined Meta from Oculus after its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-25-facebook-oculus-vr-2-billion.html">$2 billion acquisition</a>, has left the social network. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/john-carmack-meta-consulting-cto-virtual-reality-leaving-2022-12"><em>Business Insider</em></a> first reported his departure, citing people familiar with the company, and published pieces of his internal memo that contained sentiments critical of Meta and its augmented and virtual reality efforts.

He started by praising the Quest 2 headset for being what he "wanted to see from the beginning," with its inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, cost effectiveness and a screen with a resolution that's nearly 4K. However, he argued that it could "have happened a bit faster and been going better if different decisions had been made."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Carmack's main issue with Meta seems to be the company's efficiency — or, based on his memo, its lack thereof. "We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort," he wrote. "There is no way to sugar coat this; I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy."</p><p>The executive said that as "a voice at the highest levels," he felt like he should've been able to move things along, but he was "evidently not persuasive enough." While he didn't give detailed examples, Carmack noted that a good fraction of the things he complained about only turned his way a year or two after evidence of the issue had already piled up. "I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it," he added. Carmack admitted near the end of the memo that he was "wearied of the fight" but that he still believes that "VR can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta."</p><p>As the executive <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1603931901491908610">said on Twitter</a>, he makes it no secret that he has "always been pretty frustrated with how things get done at [Meta.]" In a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUk4NDVPNTdaU3k0JnQ9MTMxNDRzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNTFlMzUzYi1hZGMyLTQwMzAtOGIxMS0xNzk4YmM0NmY0OTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfChgjA0ouiGISDUrHizSzQ4_l4DLPylYsuit8Yntk27&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI845O57ZSy4%26t%3D13144s">podcast interview</a> with Lex Fridman back in August, he <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21ldGEtenVja2VyYmVyZy1tZXRhdmVyc2UuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjUxZTM1M2ItYWRjMi00MDMwLThiMTEtMTc5OGJjNDZmNDk3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYPF42uEes9A2wQVzzwKGjJS7RAycH8UA2xGm4lEaePG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F10%2F09%2Ftechnology%2Fmeta-zuckerberg-metaverse.html">said the $10 billion loss</a> by the company's AR and VR division made him "sick to [his] stomach thinking about that much money being spent." He wrote posts on Meta's internal messaging board criticizing its headsets' features and the need to install software updates before being able to use them. Apparently, he was also pushing Meta to put immediate user experience first when it comes to how it wants build out its vision of the metaverse.&nbsp;</p><p>Carmack became Oculus' first chief technology officer in 2013 after he left id Software, where he co-created the <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em> franchises. He joined Meta when, as Facebook, it purchased Oculus for $2 billion back in 2014. In 2019, he took a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-john-carmack-agi.html">step back from Oculus</a> and acted as CTO only in a consulting capacity to focus on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or the kind of AI that's capable of performing human tasks. His startup, Keen Technologies, is working on developing that type of AI systems.</p><div id="2e5e4a91756e4bbf9c26e2f96fbdd65b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">As anyone who listens to my unscripted Connect talks knows, I have always been pretty frustrated with how things get done at FB/Meta.
