Blanc was there to crack the case of a dead crime author who died in his mansion, surrounded by his money-grubbing descendants. The film\u2019s cast was all-star, with Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and Toni Collette joining the melee, and its tone was fresh. It was thrilling, it was brainy, and it was surprisingly farcical and funny. Unsurprisingly, it was a huge hit. Netflix quickly commissioned two more Knives Out mysteries.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/17/daniel-craig-glass-onion-cast-interview-kate-hudson-janelle-monae-leslie-odom-jr-edward-norton\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/17/elon-musk-reinstates-twitter-accounts-of-suspended-journalists", "title": "Elon Musk reinstates Twitter accounts of suspended journalists", "date_published": "2022-12-17 06:24:08+00:00", "description": "<p>On a wild day of bans, sudden U-turns and chaotic messaging, Musk abides by Twitter poll result that favoured restoring the accounts of reporters he accused of \u2018doxxing\u2019 him   </p><p>Elon Musk has lifted the suspensions of the Twitter accounts of several journalists he had banned a day earlier, after the second poll he conducted on the topic went against his preferred outcome.</p><p>On Thursday, Musk suspended a group of tech journalists from the website, including Ryan Mac from the New York Times, Drew Harwell of the Washington Post and CNN\u2019s Donie O\u2019Sullivan, for what he said were breaches of the company\u2019s new rule about revealing people\u2019s locations.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/17/elon-musk-reinstates-twitter-accounts-of-suspended-journalists\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/16/us-trans-non-binary-youth-suicide-mental-health", "title": "More than 50% of trans and non-binary youth in US considered suicide this year, survey says", "date_published": "2022-12-17 06:00:14+00:00", "description": "<p>The alarmingly high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide attempts are spread across liberal and conservative regions</p><p>More than 50% of transgender and non-binary youth in states across the US seriously considered suicide in the past year, according to new survey data on a worsening LGTBQ+ youth mental health crisis.</p><p>The Trevor Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention, on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/the-trevor-project-releases-new-state-level-data-on-lgbtq-youth-mental-health-victimization-access-to-support/\">released</a> state-level <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/2022-u-s-national-survey-on-lgbtq-youth-mental-health-by-state-dec-2022/\">data</a> from nearly 34,000 queer and trans youth ages 13 to 24, showing alarmingly high rates of suicide attempts, depression and anxiety across liberal and conservative regions.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/16/us-trans-non-binary-youth-suicide-mental-health\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/17/blind-date-will-james", "title": "Blind date: \u2018He said he didn\u2019t think I was weird \u2013 that was pretty heartening\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-17 06:00:13+00:00", "description": "<p>James, 25, an events manager, meets Will, 23, an office administrator</p><p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br />To meet someone I connect with.
