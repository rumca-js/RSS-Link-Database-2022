  <p id="hnCurL">Ford’s raising the price of its F-150 Lightning pickup yet again — this time, by about $4,000 (via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/16/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-gets-another-price-hike.html">CNBC</a>). The increase affects both the entry-level Pro model for business customers and the consumer-focused XLT trim with no added options, which now start at $55,974 and $63,474, respectively.</p>
<p id="phZmmk">For comparison, the Pro work truck initially started at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23065908/ford-f150-lightning-electric-truck-first-drive-specs-road-bluecruise">$39,974 when it launched</a> back in April, but subsequent price hikes brought the price up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/9/23298076/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-price-order-2023">$46,974 in August</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/10/05/ford-raises-2023-f-150-lightning-pro-price-by-5k/">$51,974 in October</a>. The base XLT, on the other hand, launched with a sticker price of $52,974 before that increased to $59,474 several months later.</p>

  <p id="UfWZkl">YouTube has removed Pornhub’s channel over “multiple” community guideline violations, as first <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/youtube-removes-pornhub-1235464049/">reported by <em>Variety</em></a>. According to Google, Pornhub’s account violated YouTube’s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257?hl=en">external link policy</a>, which prohibits users from linking to content that’s not allowed on the platform, such as pornography. </p>

  <p id="GUXUzH">Apple has exited talks to secure the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, <a href="https://puck.news/iger-expectations-the-espn-x-factor/">according to a report from <em>Puck</em>’s Dylan Byers</a> (<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/17/after-months-of-negotiations-apple-reportedly-exits-the-running-for-nfl-sunday-ticket-package/">via <em>9to5Mac</em></a>). Sources tell Byers that Apple backed out of the deal because it doesn’t “see the logic,” not because it can’t afford the NFL’s rumored <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheathletic.com%2F3907524%2F2022%2F11%2F18%2Fnfl-sunday-ticket-apple-directv%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F12%2F17%2F23513966%2Fapple-nfl-sunday-ticket-negotiations-exit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$3.5 billion asking price</a>.</p>
<p id="BF1VKd"><em>The Athletic</em>’s Daniel Kaplan backs up Byers’ reporting, <a href="https://twitter.com/KaplanSportsBiz/status/1603942200236195840?s=20&amp;t=uXWq1x1z7gip6SvPLRKzig">saying on Twitter</a> that he’s told, “Apple has indeed bowed out.” While Apple was once considered the front-runner in Sunday Ticket negotiations, talks between the iPhone maker and the NFL dragged on over the past several months, with a November <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/22/23471824/apple-nfl-negotiations-sunday-ticket-dragging-on">report from <em>The Athletic</em> indicating</a> that Apple’s expectations didn’t align with that of the NFL.</p>
