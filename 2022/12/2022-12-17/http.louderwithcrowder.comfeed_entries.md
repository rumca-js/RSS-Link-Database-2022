We didn't get the restaurant up in these here parts until a few years ago. My first experience having Chick-Fil-A in my mouth was in Atlanta in 2015, and... it was fast food chicken. But the eatery is popular with many of my right-wing brethren, and as this video shows even bears love "God's chicken."</p><p>Unclear is if the Chick-Fil-A was the main course, or a dessert after the bear finished off the UberEats driver.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>Thirty nuggets and french fries, poof! Gone just like that. But he -- or she, I'd hate to misgender the bear -- left the salad. Even black bears know that salad sucks ass.</p><p>Question though. Is it me or has there been an abnormal amount of bear-related content in 2022? We've seen a bear <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/birthday-party-crashed-by-bear" target="_blank">act out a Yogi Bear cartoon and steal a birthday cake</a> from a picnic table. We've seen a bear <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bear-steals-snacks-7-eleven" target="_blank">pretend he lived in a progressive-run city and knock over a convenience store</a>. Then there was the bear who bowed up <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grizzly-bear-college-wrestlers" target="_blank">with a pair of college wrestling bros</a>.</p><p>Now there is this bear, stealing someone's fast food delivery. It just goes to show that even animals are hard up in Joe Biden's economy. Bears are struggling to provide for their families, and some are turning to a life of crime.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Joe Biden makes claim about his uncle receiving a Purple Heart, but facts contradict Biden's brain again

Otherwise, all the times the president said things that lacked a certain truthiness might be problematic. But it's Joe Biden! <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/student-loan-biden-vote" target="_blank">Saying things that aren't true</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dead-congresswoman-kjp-biden" target="_blank">having a brain that doesn't function properly</a> is part of his blue-collar charm. And NOT <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia" target="_blank">a sign of dementia</a> as some critics claim.</p><p>Our latest installment is Biden -- the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF - claiming he awarded his uncle Frank a Purple Heart when he was vice president.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Joe Biden says after he was elected VP, he awarded his Uncle Frank with a Purple Heart he earned at the Battle of the Bulge.<br /><br />There is no evidence any of that is true — and Biden's uncle died in 1999, while Biden wasn't elected VP until 2008. <a href="https://t.co/FlJLjFAE4A">pic.twitter.com/FlJLjFAE4A</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1603959244578951168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>My dad, when I got elected vice president [in 2008], he said, ‘Joey, Uncle Frank fought in the Battle of the Bulge.’ He was not feeling very well now — not because of the Battle of the Bulge, but he said, ‘and he won the Purple Heart and he never received it. He never got it. Do you think you could help him get it? We will surprise him.</blockquote><p>There are a few problems with this story, per the reporting of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/biden-claims-his-uncle-frank-won-purple-heart-but-story-doesnt-add-up/" target="_blank">New York Post</a>. Joe Biden Sr. died in 2002 and Frank Biden died in 1999. It would surprise more than Frank Biden if Vice President Biden awarded him with a Purple Heart in -- at the earliest -- 2009...ten years after he died.  Unless Biden got confused with the time he had a reading from a psychic, and Frank Biden told him "I don’t want it" from beyond the grave</p><p>Also -- and this is key -- there is no mention of Frank Biden on his tombstone or in his obituary of having been a Purple Heart recipient. So even if Biden confused himself with Vice President Al Gore, the story doesn't add up.</p><p>This guy knew the story was bullplop.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>This guy wouldn't even make eye contact. He was busy drafting the "what the president meant to say" response in his head.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="609a6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32359512&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to the Post for comment. Please allow the possibility that this is all one giant misunderstanding.</p><p>Also allow the possibility that Joe Biden either lies a lot, or all these things legit have happened in his brain but not out in the real world with you and I. Also, please allow that the sky is a different color in Joe Biden's world than it is for the rest of us.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Classic 'X-Files' clip from 2000s goes viral predicting a - certain pandemic - with eerie accuracy

	I never got into the X-Files when it was on, so I had missed this the first go around. There is a clip going viral that critics are saying predicted, or sounds like it predicted, a familiar pandemic. </p><p>Before we get started...
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a5d54" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32359465&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>
	Let me be clear, CRITICS are saying this clip sounds familiar. Neither I nor anyone associated with at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website is making any claims. None of us are scientists or "independent" "fact-checkers." We're not qualified. All I'm doing is sharing a viral clip as I would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/popeyes-fight" target="_blank">a fast-food restaurant beatdown</a>. <strong>For entertainment purposes only</strong>.
</p><p>
	What conclusions YOU draw after watching it, that's between you and your cat.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		Watch this and have your mind blown. Whoever wrote the script for this episode of X-Files has to be a time traveler or a senior deep state operative who revealed the entire plan just for giggles 🤯🤣 <a href="https://t.co/oPmC8A4SyL">pic.twitter.com/oPmC8A4SyL</a><br />
		— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1603512101485805569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a>
</blockquote></div><p>
	For sake of argument, there were a few parts that stood out to me:
</p><p>
	- Everything the “internet lunatic” said that sounded crazy in the end turned out to be true.
</p><p>
	- <em>“No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA.”<br />
	“Unless we gave them that ability.”</em>
</p><p>- The letters “R,” “N” and “A” used in the order. Though, to be fair, no lowercase “m.”
</p><p>
	- <em>“Your own government lies as a matter of course.”</em>
</p><p>- Joel McHale’s entire rant about a cabal taking over America, and then the world itself.
</p><p>
	Though in the show’s defense, this all took place during a Republican presidency. During a Democrat presidency, I’m sure neither the Democrat president nor the people who run that Democrat president would ever imagine doing such things. And ESPECIALLY not in Uber-progressive countries like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/quarantine-camp-26-year-old" target="_blank">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jacinda-ardern-free-speech-un" target="_blank">New Zealand</a>, and the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/farmers-dutch-regulations" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>.

</p>
<p>But as the ginger said at the beginning (not Gillian Anderson, the other ginger) none of this is science. This is all science fiction.</p><p>Nothing to see here. Please go back to your lives.Where you are no doubt at the mall for the last consuming weekend before the holidays.</p><p><p>
