Often called the world’s first Assault Rifle, the Sturmgewehr 44 is an essential addition to many second world war movies, TV shows and video games. The rifle has been a huge influence on firearms history, as well as having a recurring role in World War 2 games like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty. And while often one of the most powerful entries in the arsenal of those video games, does the truth of this historic weapon match up to its on-screen legacy, and does its appearance in games today still kick up a storm?

Here are our five best PC games of 2022 and five honorable mentions that you should check out ASAP.

The PC gaming ecosystem is easily the largest in the industry, with tens of thousands of games available to play. Not only that, unlike Switch or PlayStation, there isn't exactly a "first-party" publisher on PC, which means there are few true marquee exclusive games on the platform. Therefore, this list of the year's five best PC games naturally features games you'll sometimes (though not always) find elsewhere, but in cases where multiplatform games appear, we believe they're best played on PC and deserve a spot on this list. This year's list is an eclectic bunch, too, with a speedrunning gem, a deep detective-like experience, and a physics playground all earning top spots.
