Facilities she has designed for handling livestock are used by companies all around the world. Her work has also been instrumental in implementing animal welfare auditing programs, now used by McDonalds, Wendy\u2019s, Whole Foods, and many other major corporations. Temple has appeared on numerous shows across platforms, such as 20/20, Larry King Live, and Prime Time. Grandin is an accomplished author, with books such as Thinking in Pictures, Livestock Handling and Transport, and The Autistic Brain. A few of her other publications, Animals in Translation, as well as Visual Thinking, have even made it to the New York Times Bestseller List. In 2017, Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2022 she was honored once again as a Colorado State Distinguished Professor. \n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee: Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\nExodus90: Is it time for your Exodus?
