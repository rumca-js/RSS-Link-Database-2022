<p>He wasn’t just a demigod in Brazil, but the first truly global football star</p><p>In the final seconds of the 1958 World Cup final, with Brazil already 4-2 ahead, Pelé, then just 17 years old, received a long ball near the Swedish penalty area. He caught it on his chest, stunning it so smartly that the ball dropped at his feet. He stepped over the ball and effortlessly back-heeled it to a team mate. With the crowd still cheering this, the ball was lobbed back into the area and, insouciantly, Pelé flicked it with the side of his head into the goal. Within moments, Brazil had<strong> </strong>won their first World Cup, making the nation’s identity, then better known for coffee, synonymous with football. Pelé, reduced to floods of tears on the pitch, began his life as the embodiment of Brazilian football.</p><p>It is worth recalling how much was riding on this moment for Brazil. The country’s scintillating Afro-Brazilian stars, such as Leônidas, first caught the world’s attention at the 1938 World Cup. Commentators at the time suggested that the country’s hybrid Afro-Indian-European demography was the greatest strength behind its football and culture. The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was meant to cement this notion, but the shock defeat to Uruguay in the final game <em>–</em> the<em> </em><em>Maracanazo </em><em>– </em>was read as a failure of the country’s modernisation and its pathological miscegenation; the black players were made scapegoats for the defeat and racist stereotypes were reactivated. In 1958 the curse was lifted. Brazil’s super-diverse squad had become champions playing in their own unique style; Pelé was the star, and the world took notice.</p><p>David Goldblatt is the author of The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football and The Game of Our Lives</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/29/pele-football-greatness-brazil-global-star">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Global superstar of football who was a hugely prolific goalscorer and three times a World Cup winner with Brazil</p><p>Pelé, who has died aged 82 after suffering from cancer, is widely regarded as the greatest footballer the game has ever seen. He was the only player to have won the World Cup three times, and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his long career was that he reached his apotheosis so early, and on the world’s biggest stage. He was 17 when he played for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, scoring six goals in their last three games – the winner in the quarter-final, a hat-trick in the semi-final and two in the final – his confidence and stature growing palpably with every game.</p><p>Almost two decades later he came out of retirement and made the almost unthinkable decision of signing for New York Cosmos. For all its wealth, the US was then a pauper of the football world, and it was Pelé who helped introduce Americans to “soccer”. His first game was televised in 22 countries, and the pitch, more dirt than grass, had to be spray-painted green for the watching world. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/pele-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

From there he never stopped scoring, 12 years on at the 1970 World Cup he won the Golden Ball and scored a towering header in the final against Italy.

I had am-dram rehearsals several days a week, parties every weekend, and on my quieter days I’d have friends over to watch Rent for the eighth time that month. I was 17 and living the dream – my social life was, as the kids no longer say, “popping”. Now, I’m 30 and my social life is not popping; it’s barely even sizzling. And there is a little part of me that’s OK with that – I like my dressing gown and box sets, sue me.</p><p>But apparently (and this might come as a shock to you), it’s good to socialise and stimulate the brain. Who knew?! So I’ve decided that in 2023 I would like to have more of a social life. Which sounds a bit tragic really, doesn’t it? Yes, Amy, yes it does.

I’ve eaten ostrich in South Africa years ago. But, no. It wasn’t an ostrich farm anyway, it was an emu farm, and it was destroyed by a hurricane in the late 90s or early 00s. This just shows you how digital news never goes away. It’s like radiation. That’s why we have to watch it with news, because they’re still saying Terminator X has his ostrich farm, and no matter how many times we refute it, this same dumb-ass question comes up. It’s no one’s fault: it just shows how far we’ve got [to go] to get the space junk out of orbit, bro.</p><p><strong>The music you made in the 80s still sounds </strong><strong>vital and fresh, like it was made yesterday. Of today’s hip-hop artists, who do you think will still be talked about in 35 years, and what current artists inspire you? </strong><em>Hhhhssss<br /></em>There’s so many, it’s hard to choose.

<p>Work isn’t designed to make you feel anything good. But that can be a freeing realisation, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong></p><p><strong>How do I figure out what to do with my professional life? I have always been considered a smart and ambitious young woman. I have an honours bachelor degree, a master’s degree from an internationally lauded university and I excel at whatever job I’ve held (which has been at least 10 in the past 10 years). However I find little to no satisfaction in my working life. I’ve tried everything from archaeology to winemaking to high-flying philanthropy to real estate, but nothing sticks. My parents think I’m a “Pollyanna” who just gets excited at the prospect of something and then disappointed once the rose-coloured glasses come off. I don’t think that’s the whole picture. I am a hard worker, very committed when I start out, often even working myself to burnout.</strong></p><p><strong>I have an analytical mind, but I don’t think I’m overly critical once the honeymoon ends, as my parents suggest. Will I always feel helpless and bored and pointless at work? How can I find something that pays to have a moderate standard of living, that I don’t hate doing and engages me enough that I don’t feel like quitting? I have many decades-long hobbies and friendships, and studied hard for many years, so I know that I’m not “a quitter” by nature, just with work. Sometimes I think, did I use up all my effort too early in life?</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/how-do-i-figure-out-what-to-do-with-my-professional-life-will-i-always-feel-helpless-and-bored">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What do you give the prince who’s already sharing his home with an ex-wife and five dogs? That’s right: more dogs!</p><p>It was an image that spoke to a nation in mourning, and even those not deep in mourning felt the natural empathy of the dog-lover: Muick and Sandy, the Queen’s corgis, attended by footmen as they watched her funeral procession. What would be the dogs’ fate? Did they even understand that their destiny had changed for ever?</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II was in fact survived by four dogs: two corgis, a dorgi and a cocker spaniel. The last, Lissy, is a baffler, since she wasn’t of either breed for which the Queen had such pronounced preference, and Elizabeth named her after<em> herself. </em>The need for disambiguation must have been constant, although Lissy’s registered pedigree name is Wolferton Drama. Anyway, she is living with her trainer, Ian Openshaw, for the time being.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/29/what-happened-to-queens-corgis-living-with-prince-andrew">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liverpool forward’s trip to the King Power a year ago prefaced a patchy 2022 but he has now well and truly regained his mojo</p><p>Liverpool face Leicester on Friday evening looking to win a fourth Premier League game in succession and strengthen their push for a top-four place. For one of their players the encounter also provides an opportunity for redemption, the chance to right a wrong from almost exactly a year ago and further demonstrate that after a difficult 12 months he is back to his very best.</p><p>Indeed Mohamed Salah may well look back at events at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday, 28 December 2021 as when things turned against him. He went into the game against Leicester in sensational form having scored 22 goals in 24 appearances for a rampant Liverpool side. He, and they, appeared set for more joy on a chilly night in the east Midlands, especially given the hosts were in poor form and severely hampered by injuries, and everything appeared to be going to plan when on 15 minutes the visitors were awarded a penalty after a foul by Wilfred Ndidi on Salah. He took it himself, and then came the twist – the shot was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, with the Egyptian’s header from the subsequent rebound crashing against the bar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/resurgent-mohamed-salah-seeks-to-banish-ghost-christmas-past-leicester-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A remarkable year included Italy’s win in Cardiff and the end of Eddie Jones’s England reign plus a dramatic Women’s World Cup final</p><p>Italy arrived in Cardiff on the back of 36 consecutive defeats in the Six Nations and though Wales had hardly had a championship to remember – a disappointing defence of their title – given the <em>Azzurri</em>’s tendency to get worse as the tournament goes on they were given little hope of breaking their seven-year duck. They were heading for another gallant defeat when Josh Adams went over after 68 minutes, but with less than two minutes to go Edoardo Padovani gathered Kieran Hardy’s overhit box-kick and passed inside to Ange Capuozzo. The full-back, then 22, cemented his burgeoning reputation with a dazzling run, through Adams, then twisted Hardy inside out and delivered the pass to Padovani to score. Paolo Garbisi nailed the conversion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/wales-italy-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">to seal a magnificent victory</a>. Italy built on it by defeating Australia this autumn, adding further intrigue to next year’s tournament, with a home match against France kicking off their campaign.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/29/sports-most-memorable-moments-of-2022-no-4-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

What else can I make with it?</strong><br /><em><strong>Viv, Cardiff</strong></em><br />Not all marsala is made equal: you have <em>secco</em> (dry), <em>semi-secco</em> (medium-dry) and <em>dolce</em> (sweet), but, as Viv is talking tiramisu, I’m going to assume it’s the last that’s in need of using up. However, before we dive into that, the Guardian’s drinks expert <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/fiona-beckett-on-wine">Fiona Beckett</a> says it’s worth noting that this Sicilian fortified wine is often sold in half-bottles, although she grants that’s not much use to Viv now. “That said,” Beckett adds, “the great news is that you can essentially use it wherever you would use a sweet sherry.”</p><p>First and foremost, consider spent marsala a cook’s treat. “Dip into it when you’ve finally got rid of the family and things quieten down,” says Beckett, who suggests sipping it with any leftover Christmas cake, chocolate or stilton.

This year, that will finally change as she releases her long-awaited debut, Island 54. It holds true to her willingness to meld multiple music styles – the dancehall of her youth, lightning-fast verses influenced by grime, even South African dance style amapiano – and her eagerness to prove herself as a creative force.</p><p><strong>On the album you’re playing with lots of genres</strong><strong>. What</strong><strong> motivated you to explore new sounds?<br /></strong>It’s just been natural. [The amapiano track] is very interesting, right? I love amapiano. I go to Ghana every year for New Year. If you’re in a dance, all you hear is afrobeats, amapiano, it always gets everyone going. It’s just a hype! I was brought up in Holland, my parents are Jamaican, so everything is a mix. I’m so used to hearing many different languages and many different sounds that I connect with. That’s why my music is very versatile – I don’t stick to just one thing because I’m not one thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/29/stefflon-don">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This tale of brothel workers in gold rush America lacks mystery and risk</p><p>Eliza is not sorry when her husband dies. Peter Cargill is 20 years older than his 18-year-old bride, and persuades her parents back in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that he will be a tender and supportive spouse. But as they chase the gold rush and head out west, the opposite turns out to be the case. The year is 1851, and there is little recourse for Eliza against his cruelties: “He had made it clear that he intended to put it to her, whether she liked it or not, once or twice every day.” So when he’s shot in a bar fight in Monterey, it’s a relief. But how will the young widow support herself? Fortunate, then, that one Mrs Parks offers her work in a brothel. The place is spacious, with a nice veranda, “and the first fellow who came to her treated her much more kindly than Peter ever had”.</p><p>So begins A Dangerous Business, the latest from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jane-smiley" title="">Jane Smiley</a>, best known for her prize-winning 1991 novel A Thousand Acres, King Lear recast on an Iowa farm. She returned to Iowa more recently for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/21/golden-age-jane-smiley-review-final-volume-the-last-hundred-years-trilogy" title="">the Last Hundred Years trilogy</a>, a family saga stretching across the 20th century. In these and many other books she has proved herself a sensitive chronicler of the American scene. Yet A Dangerous Business is startlingly flat and unsatisfying. It is a mystery with no mystery, a book in which the characters develop not a whit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/29/a-dangerous-business-by-jane-smiley-review-madams-and">Continue reading...</a>

My job is to make sure that referees are going into their job feeling confident and supported.”</p><p>After eight years away, the most successful referee of the Premier League era has come back to the English game. His contract overseeing officials in the US had come to an end and he had been in discussions about coming home in some form for a while, but Webb’s appointment as the first chief refereeing officer in the elite game has the feel of a necessity, as – by common consent – the men in black need all the help they can get.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/howard-webb-returns-to-england-on-mission-to-boost-referees-confidence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This epic account of Ottoman decline and the birth of modern Turkey is a tour de force of accessible scholarship</p><p>By the end of 1918, after four increasingly grim years of warfare, revolution was in the air across Europe. Thrones wobbled; rulers abdicated. In the space of months, the great, centuries-old dynasties of the Romanovs, Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns were all toppled from power.</p><p>At the eastern edge of the continent lay the vast, ancient empire that the Ottoman sultans had built up since the 14th century. At its height, around 1700, it had stretched across north Africa, Arabia, Mesopotamia and around the Black Sea, also encompassing Greece, the Balkans and the Danube valley, stopping just short of Vienna. But in the course of the 19th century, as its economic and military power declined, many of its outermost lands were lost to conquest or insurrection. Local nationalist movements, and rival colonial powers such as Russia, Britain and Austria-Hungary, stripped away Greece, the Balkans, Bulgaria, Macedonia, the lands around the Black Sea, and all of its African possessions. When the Ottomans sided with Germany in the first world war, the British and French gradually captured all of the Middle East. After the war, humiliatingly, they even occupied Istanbul itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/29/the-last-days-of-the-ottoman-empire-by-ryan-gingeras-fall-of-the-sultans">Continue reading...</a>

The entirety of their 20-year output, save a one-off detour in 2015, has taken place in a sci-fi cosmos called Heaven’s Fence. What started as a way for frontman and comic book geek Claudio Sanchez to express himself has spiralled into a mess of metanarratives with countless characters.</p><p>On Vaxis – Act II: A Window of the Waking Mind, the band mercifully juxtapose a sprawling concept with some of their most concise and infectious songwriting to date. The sequel to 2018’s Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures is the second part of a planned pentalogy, but it eschews the self-indulgence of its 80-minute predecessor. In its place are no-frills pop anthems such as Beautiful Losers and Shoulders, which have choruses that fly higher than a rocketship.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/29/coheed-and-cambria-vaxis-act-ii-a-window-of-the-waking-mind-review-roadrunner">Continue reading...</a>

## The winning recipe: how the small-market Pelicans became legit title contenders

<p>Even with the Pelicans having perched themselves at or near the top of the Western Conference all year, many don’t seem to take them seriously as contenders. It’s time for that to change</p><p>A lot has been made over the years of the raw deal offered to small-market NBA teams. The younger brothers of the league, they often get overlooked in favor of their flashier coastal franchise siblings. While I’ve always argued that a competent front office is the tried and true salve for this issue, as evidenced by Giannis Antetokoumpo’s loyalty (and delivery of a championship) to the Milwaukee Bucks, it’s verifiable that as far as national media coverage goes, smaller-name teams often don’t get their due.</p><p>One such team is the New Orleans Pelicans. I mentioned in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/18/nba-playoffs-2022-highlights-talking-points">my end-of-season wrap in June</a> that I believed the future to be decidedly bright in Louisiana. With Zion’s long-awaited return to form on the court having even exceeded expectations so far, that looks to have been a sound prediction. But even with the team having perched themselves at or near the top of the Western Conference standings all year, many don’t seem to take them seriously as contenders. While, yes, the team hasn’t historically made much noise in the postseason, and doesn’t currently boast any NBA champions on its roster, there’s more than enough reason to believe that Nola won’t have to wait long to bring a Larry O’Brien to Bourbon Street. And that’s because of one simple fact: they already have all the ingredients that go into the recipe of a champion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/29/new-orleans-pelicans-nba-championship-contenders">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My snapshot of 2022 shows the Amazon burning – but what it doesn’t communicate is the pain</p><p>I have covered the Amazon as a journalist for almost 25 years. It started in 1998, with a trip along the Trans-Amazonian Highway. In 2017, I moved to the city of Altamira in Pará, northern Brazil; it is the centre of the deforestation, forest fires and social devastation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/06/urban-poor-tragedy-altamira-belo-monte-brazil">caused</a> by the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam. I moved here because I no longer wanted to be just a “special correspondent to the Amazon”, but so I could describe what was happening to the largest tropical forest on the planet from the inside. Despite this long experience, 2022 was the first year in which I watched the forest burn from the window of my home. I didn’t need to go to the fire, as journalists normally do. The fire had come to me. </p><p>The photo I’ve chosen, taken by my husband, is from the night of 27 August. Later, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research revealed that it was the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-09-brazilian-amazon-worst-august-years.html#:~:text=All%20the%20worst%20August%20figures,seeking%20re%2Delection%20next%20month">worst August for fires</a> in the Amazon since 2010.

## The New Life by Tom Crewe review – desire on trial

<p>Inspired by the fight to change the law and social mores in Victorian England, this excellent debut dramatises physical intensity and moral dilemmas</p><p>Tom Crewe’s virtuoso debut The New Life is one of the most embodied historical novels I have read. The tone is set in the extraordinary opening scene. It’s London in 1894, and John is jostled against another man in a tube carriage, “close enough to smell the hairs on the back of the man’s neck”. John has an erection, “cramped” flat against the man’s body, and the man begins to move his buttocks against him. As the scene becomes more openly outrageous – the man unbuttons his flies and reaches in – it becomes clear that this is a dream. It’s a dangerous literary move but it succeeds, because it’s immediately evident that this is a novel about an erotic life that’s as yet unrealisable. From the constrictive comfort of his marital bed, John is dreaming his way into a future yet to be born.</p><p>John Addington is one of two married men who will soon collaborate on a book entitled Sexual Inversion, based on the real 1897 book of the same name by Havelock Ellis and John Addington Symonds. Crewe’s Addington has got to a point where he’s prepared to risk everything for lust, and for openness about who he is, because he is “dying” from the feeling that he’s wasted his life and destroyed his wife’s life in the process. Just when he’s begun discreetly circulating a celebration of homosexuality in ancient Greece to his friends, he’s propositioned by a man in the park and quickly moves him into his marital home as his secretary. In this febrile, ecstatic and guilty state, he encounters an article by Henry Ellis declaring that “morality is thus the normal activity of a healthy nature”. He then writes wishfully to Ellis and their collaboration begins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/29/the-new-life-by-tom-crewe-review-desire-on-trial">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While there’s something to be said for tilting the hetero norms of the genre, the rest of this low-grade nasty should be swiftly consigned to history</p><p>Since the very dawn of the seventh art, critics and cinephiles have debated … what are the very best LGBT slasher films? It is possible that in a couple of decades, this film will be subject to some kind of bold revisionist reconsideration, some flashy contrarian reassessment, and creep in to the lower reaches of the Top Million.

<p>Chinese surveillance manufacturer Hikvision has put in place tools to help police track protest activities</p><p>Chinese police can set up “alarms” for various protest activities using a software platform provided by Hikvision, a major Chinese camera and surveillance manufacturer, the Guardian has learned. Descriptions of protest activity listed among the “alarms” include “gathering crowds to disrupt order in public places”, “unlawful assembly, procession, demonstration” and threats to “petition”.</p><p>These activities are listed alongside offenses such as “gambling” or disruptive events such as “fire hazard” in technical documents available on Hikvision’s website and flagged to the Guardian by surveillance research firm IPVM, or Internet Protocol Video Market. The company’s website also included alarms for “religion” and “Falun Gong” – a spiritual movement banned in China and categorized as a cult by the government – until IPVM contacted the company. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/29/china-surveillance-protests-alarms-cameras-hikvision">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hartnett, 54, and Borthwick, 41, met when they were chefs together at the Connaught hotel and were firm friends for a decade before their relationship became more serious. They now live together in London</p><p>In 2002, chef and cookbook author Angela Hartnett was heading the restaurant team at the Connaught hotel in London. When fellow chef Neil Borthwick came to work for her, she was impressed by his skills, as well as his sense of humour. “I was in the meat and fish section,” he says. “I’d previously been working in Scotland but I wanted to train up in London and then go to France.” He soon became good friends with Angela. “She was very pretty and cheeky; we were always laughing,” he says. Although she sensed he “might have a thing for me” they kept things professional. “As well as the fact I was his boss, he was also much younger than me and it wouldn’t have been appropriate,” says Angela.</p><p>Four years later, Neil followed his dreams and moved to Valence in France to work for the chef Anne-Sophie Pic at the Maison Pic. He and Angela stayed in touch and continued to meet up several times a year. “We knew a lot of the same people and sometimes a few of us would go to France to visit Neil and try out different restaurants together,” she says. In that time, Angela also opened Murano, a Michelin-starred Italian restaurant in Mayfair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/29/how-neil-borthwick-met-angela-hartnett-we-were-in-this-tiny-lift-all-you-could-do-was-end-up-snogging">Continue reading...</a>
