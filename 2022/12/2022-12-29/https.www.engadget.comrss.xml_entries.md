<p>Almost seven months after the state legislature overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-passes-digital-fair-repair-act-bill-185302417.html">passed a right-to-repair bill</a>, New York governor Kathy Hochul has signed it into law. But Hochul only greenlit the bill after the legislature agreed to some changes. Hochul wrote in a memo that the legislation, as it was originally drafted, "included technical issues that could put safety and security at risk, as well as heighten the risk of injury from physical repair projects." The governor said the modifications addressed these issues, but critics say the amendments will weaken the law's effectiveness.</p><p>"This legislation would enhance consumer options in the repair markets by granting them greater access to the parts, tools and documents needed for repairs," Hochul wrote. "Encouraging consumers to maximize the lifespan of their devices through repairs is a laudable goal to save money and reduce electronic waste."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f1b210b1973b4ac3a594cfb8eeeaa2a2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">New: Gov. Hochul has signed the “right to repair” law — with the Legislature agreeing to a number of changes, as outlined in her approval message. <a href="https://t.co/GUBExlj5BD">pic.twitter.com/GUBExlj5BD</a></p>— Jon Campbell (@JonCampbellNY) <a href="https://twitter.com/JonCampbellNY/status/1608327624526548993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The changes strip out the bill's requirement for "original equipment manufacturers [or OEMs] to provide to the public any passwords, security codes or materials to override security features." OEMs will also be able to bundle "assemblies of parts" instead of just the specific component actually needed for a DIY repair if "the risk of improper installation heightens the risk of injury."&nbsp;</p><p>The rules will only apply to devices that are originally built and used or sold in New York for the first time after July 1st. There's also an exemption for "digital products that are the subject of business-to-business or business-to-government sales and that otherwise are not offered for sale by retailers."</p><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/right-to-repair-bill-passed-in-june-still-awaits-ny-governors-signature/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> reported earlier this month, representatives for Microsoft and Apple pressed Hochul's office for changes. So did industry association TechNet, which represents many notable tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Dell, HP and Engadget parent Yahoo.</p><p>As a result, the bill's revised language excludes enterprise electronics, such as those that schools, hospitals, universities and data centers rely on, as iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/70515/new-york-passes-historic-right-to-repair-bill">wrote in a blog post</a>. Home appliances, motor vehicles, medical devices and off-road equipment were previously exempted.</p><p>"Such changes could limit the benefits for school computers and most products currently in use," Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG), a collective of consumer rights organizations, said in a statement to Engadget. "Even more troubling, the bill now excludes certain smartphone circuit boards from parts the manufacturers are required to sell, and requires repair shops to post unwieldy warranty language."</p><p>"We knew it was going to be difficult to face down the biggest and wealthiest companies in the world," PIRG right to repair director Nathan Proctor said. "But, though trimmed down, a new Right to Repair law was signed. Now our work remains to strengthen this law and pass others until people have what they need to fix their stuff."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23530733/right-to-repair-law-new-york-tech-hochul-oems-parts"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, repair technician and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/right%20to%20repair/">right-to-repair</a> advocate Louis Rossmann said the changes have watered down the law to the point where it's "functionally useless." Rossmann, who spent seven years trying to get the bill passed, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PTd4R0JCLTcxN0FJIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOWQ3MTFiZi05NjAwLTQwN2ItOWYyNS1mZDJiMGNjNDliN2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYuGY67stxf8bI6pFBG8L6cLncZ7whuwZkhoPzCRJDJb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7xGBB-717AI">called</a> Hochul's assertion that the changes were necessary to include protections from physical harm and security risks "bullshit," citing a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">Federal Trade Commission report</a> on the issue.</p><p>The right-to-repair movement has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-eu-right-to-repair-phones-tablets-computers.html">picked up steam</a> over the last couple of years.

<p>It’s been a decade since the first Tesla EV made its commercial debut and the electrification of American automotive society began in earnest. Acceptance at the newfangled technology was slow at first but, over the past ten years as battery capacities have grown and range anxieties have shrunk, electric vehicles have become a daily sight in most parts of the country. Doesn’t hurt that virtually every notable automaker on the planet has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lotus-unveils-its-first-electric-vehicle-the-eletre-hyper-suv-214006936.html">jumped on the electric bandwagon</a> with sizable investments in battery and production technologies as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maseratti-plans-to-go-fully-electric-by-2025-165704355.html">pledges to electrify their lineups</a> within <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maseratti-plans-to-go-fully-electric-by-2025-165704355.html">a decade or so</a>.</p><p>Not even recent years’ production slowdowns and supply chain disruptions brought on by the COVID pandemic managed to stall the industry’s momentum. The International Energy Agency in January reported that EVs had managed to triple their market share between 2019 and 2021 with <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/electric-cars-fend-off-supply-challenges-to-more-than-double-global-sales">6.6 million units being sold globally last year</a>. That’s not to discount the crippling impacts of the chip shortage, which saw <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/584672/ford-f150-lightning-stockpile-supply-constraints/">fleets of nearly-finished electrified vehicles parked and idled</a> as they awaited necessary components. Or in Tesla’s case, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/tesla-cut-a-steering-component-to-deal-with-chip-shortage.html">simply sold without the needed part</a> — oh calm down, it’s just the steering column, there’s nothing critical in there, anyway that’s what autopilot is for, right?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9b72a765ba2942beb2b23f016b1705f1"></div><p>2022 has eliminated any lingering doubts about whether EVs are here to stay (hint: they are). “So far in 2022, global EV sales are up 70 percent, or around 2 million units,” from 2021’s figures, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-ev-sales-are-up-70-in-2022-creating-major-demand-for-lithium-industry-301701310.html">according to Morgan Stanley</a>. It is expecting a further 22 percent increase — around another 1.8 million units — in 2023. China’s <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/626150/byd-plugin-car-sales-november2022/">BYD set monthly EV sales records</a> throughout the year. Domestically, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/625909/us-electric-car-registrations-october2022/">an Experian study released in October</a> noted more than 600,000 new EV registrations through the first ten months of 2022, a 60 percent year-over-year jump. EVs may not be quite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/consumer-reports-hybrid-reliability-ev-phev-170003341.html">as ruggedized as their hybrid cousins</a>, but who cares about that when you’ve got Ken “Let’s See If I Can Barrel Roll This Car” Block <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ken-block-gymkhana-ev-audi-las-vegas-163637533.html">blowing the doors off of the Vegas Strip in an 800V Audi S1 Hoonitron</a>? Or have VW <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-id-buzz-first-look-an-ev-that-makes-vans-cool-again-145008811.html">tickling the American public’s deep seated nostalgia</a> with a reimagined Hippy Wagon for the 21st century? Even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-and-honda-want-to-make-their-ev-partnership-a-standalone-business-102500265.html">Sony is getting into the EV game</a>. EVs are no longer niche, they’ve become an indelible part of the culture.</p><p>In terms of market share, Tesla and BYD both retained their dominant positions within their relative markets and <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-ev-sales-q3-2022/">briefly jockeyed for the world number one spot before BYD pulled away</a>. The Chinese automaker’s EV sales now account for nearly 20 percent of the global total. For its part, Tesla passed notable milestones in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-texas-gigafactory-10000-model-y-suv-210705243.html">its 10,000th Model Y produced at the Texas Gigafactory</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-gigafactory-shanghai-1-million-cars-131341359.html">the millionth vehicle to roll out of production at Gigafactory Shanghai</a>.</p><p>2022 also saw big moves and bigger investments from the rest of the automotive industry, from Ford and General Motors especially. Ford began <a href="http://v/">delivering its highly-anticipated F-150 Lightning EV pickup in May</a>, turned them into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f150-lightning-ev-video-conference-cisco-144524364.html">roving conference rooms</a> with help from Cisco, began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bidirectional-ev-charging-f-150-lightning-180545326.html">beta testing their bidirectional charging capabilities with California’s public utility</a> as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-partners-with-californias-pge-for-ev-to-home-charging-pilot-program-133055617.html">did GM</a>, developed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-manufacturing-rate-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-131424727.html">a new battery chemistry</a>, announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-europe-ev-launches-2024-164136546.html">bring seven more EV models to the European market by 2024</a>, and imagined a world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-wants-ev-sales-online-no-car-dealerships-232018196.html">without dealer showrooms</a> for EV sales.

The Korean automaker, which has quietly risen to prominence in the US market in recent years, announced its next EV flagship, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq6-ev-sedan-unveil-first-look-013018729.html">Ioniq 6</a>, in July the latest in Hyundai’s effort to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-17-electric-vehicles-by-2030-130556597.html">release 17 electric vehicle models by the end of the decade</a>.

VW opened <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id-4-production-chattanooga-183004034.html">a new ID.4 production plant</a> in Tennessee, announced plans to invest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-will-invest-71-billion-in-its-north-american-production-capacity-171951916.html">an additional $7.1 billion</a> into its North American production capacity over the next five years and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-is-getting-into-the-ev-battery-business-171952352.html">dipped its toes into the EV battery business</a> as well. Pfft, all Volvo did this year was debut the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-officially-reveals-the-ex90-ev-suv-its-safest-car-ever-144414196.html">safest car ever</a>.”</p><p>And it wasn’t just the established brands, Lucid Motors is riding high this holiday season, buoyed by the November unveiling of its new top of the line <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-sapphire-performance-brand-1200-horsepower-140006045.html">Air Sapphire</a> along with two (ahem, <em>relatively</em>) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-pure-touring-trim-video-140048588.html">less expensive Air model variants</a>, which will start at $87,000 with 410 miles of range and go up from there.

The following month, GM announced that it will partner with EVGo to create a 500-station “coast-to-coast” fast-charge network and in December, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-launches-its-community-charging-program-in-two-states-130001577.html">opened its first two Community Charging Initiative sites in Wisconsin and Detroit</a>.

<p>So you managed to buy a PlayStation 5 – congratulations, you beat supply shortages to obtain one of the most sought-after consoles in recent memory. Now comes the fun part. No PS5 is complete without a library of games and accessories to elevate your experience. Thankfully, you won't have as much trouble getting your hands on those. However, if you're new to the console, the tricky part is knowing what titles and peripherals are worth your time. We’ve gathered our favorites here to make the search easier for you.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus Extra</h2><p></p><p>If the PS5 is your first console or you're coming from an Xbox, one of the first things you'll want to pick up is a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvcHMtcGx1cy8_ZW1jaWQ9cGEtY28tNDQ1NDY0JmdjbGlkPUNqMEtDUWlBbTV5Y0JoQ1hBUklzQVBsZHpvVTBjTFJ1UkxjMlRFQ2xRVm1CaGdxM0tqbDB5M2ZiVHJ1N2JXY2Q0S1diX2lxMnR1U094SlFhQWlia0VBTHdfd2NCJmdjbHNyYz1hdy5kcyNleHRyYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjQ1ZTBkYmEtOWZmOC00OWQ4LTlkNDUtOWE3MTRlMzU0NjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXnzFbERAovTx-XJojLJUBvnWhvY-PoeAFtreI1ccDx2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fps-plus%2F%3Femcid%3Dpa-co-445464%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAm5ycBhCXARIsAPldzoU0cLRuRLc2TEClQVmBhgq3Kjl0y3fbTru7bWcd4KWb_iq2tuSOxJQaAibkEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%23extra">PlayStation Plus Extra subscription</a>. It’ll help you flesh out your library. Sony recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-plus-subscription-game-pass-121037157.html">revamped</a> the service to add separate tiers. Of the three tiers that are currently available, the “Extra” one is the best value. Priced at $15 per month, it grants you access to a library of up to 400 downloadable PS4 and PS5 games. Each month, you’ll also get a handful of free games and PlayStation Store discounts. The combination of those perks makes it easy to start making the most of your new PS5.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>SteelSeries Arctis 7P+</h2><p></p><p>Do the people you live with a favor and buy yourself a decent headset. It will help you stop nerves from fraying and is a must for any multiplayer game. The options for gaming headsets are vast, so we recommend picking one with a solid track record. SteelSeries recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-arctis-7-7plus-annoucement-195740872.html">updated its iconic Arctis 7</a> headset with the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8351d9d-883b-4d2b-9ca2-def694c65fa7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=SteelSeries&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlODM1MWQ5ZC04ODNiLTRkMmItOWNhMi1kZWY2OTRjNjVmYTciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdGVlbHNlcmllcy5jb20vZ2FtaW5nLWhlYWRzZXRzL2FyY3Rpcy03cC1wbHVzPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjQ1ZTBkYmEtOWZmOC00OWQ4LTlkNDUtOWE3MTRlMzU0NjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZkWcO6gPJtoE4GRcc03SBJFhP9ly3h6v1Y705pGM_pF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7p-plus%3F">7P+</a> which has improved battery life and a USB-C port for charging. What the company <em>didn't </em>change was the headband design that many people credit for making the Arctis 7 one of the more comfortable headsets on the market. The 7P+ costs the same as the standard 7+ variant, but also adds full support for the PS5's Tempest 3D audio technology.</p><h2>WD Black SN850</h2><p></p><p>Sony recently released an update to allow PS5 owners to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html">expand their console's internal storage</a>. And it's a good thing, because the 667GB of usable storage the console comes with can feel limiting quickly. We already published a comprehensive guide on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">best SSDs</a> you can buy for your PlayStation 5. You'll want to check that article out for a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade your SSD. But if you want to make things as simple as possible, your best bet is a Gen4 M.2 NVME SSD with a built-in heatsink. One of the better plug-and-play options is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFBIU1ZXN0svcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZ0aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUw3krPhvLRh64slxm7YihORKbiYwdC9qNqyxGsFuMI3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08PHSVW7K%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1">SN850 from WD Black</a>. It checks off all the compatibility requirements listed by Sony and is reasonably priced, too.</p><h2>Samsung T7 SSD</h2><p></p><p>If you don't feel comfortable opening your PS5 to install a new SSD, another option is to purchase an external solid-state drive. Keep in mind that <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tY2Evc3VwcG9ydC9oYXJkd2FyZS9wczUtZXh0ZW5kZWQtc3RvcmFnZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeuvMVb0tDrkV6Maoxe-9yhXyvRioDmB2pzWHLcDkMp4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-ca%2Fsupport%2Fhardware%2Fps5-extended-storage%2F">you can't play PS5</a> games from an external drive. However, it takes less time to copy one over from an SSD than it does to download it from the PlayStation Store. One of our favorite portable drives is the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg3NFlKUDkyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU7Be52VhKJTXIv2Paq07vkfGNeezGTgYN-hUJOHuTxa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0874YJP92%3F">Samsung T7</a>. It can write files at a speedy 1,000 MB/s and comes with a shock-resistant enclosure to protect the drive from physical damage. If you plan to use the SSD exclusively for storing games, you can save money by buying the standard model instead of the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVJlc2lzdGFudC1QaG90b2dyYXBoZXJzLU1VLVBFMlQwUy1BTS9kcC9CMDlWTEhSNEpDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAS8o7ALvHEIl3VSeBiOlTizAWdaRGDJG_Ve6Ah8KVaPh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Resistant-Photographers-MU-PE2T0S-AM%2Fdp%2FB09VLHR4JC">Shield variant</a>, which has a ruggedized exterior for extra protection for those who are always on the go.</p><h2>DualSense Charging Station</h2><p></p><p>While you can charge your <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EdWFsU2Vuc2UtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ29udHJvbGxlci1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOEZDNkM3NVk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay3DiU1XCbhfnSgG-YkoJm0H-YJcpxaUh-GNRjDSoSD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC6C75Y">DualSense controller</a> with the USB-C cable that comes with your PS5, a more elegant solution is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EdWFsU2Vuc2UtQ2hhcmdpbmctU3RhdGlvbi1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOEZDNlk0Vkc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0NWUwZGJhLTlmZjgtNDlkOC05ZDQ1LTlhNzE0ZTM1NDYzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASJVP5_KV2w6svhmvvZGAFQP_9DZSYzas170VPX5x8wc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDualSense-Charging-Station-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC6Y4VG">DualSense Charging Station</a>. It can store and charge two controllers simultaneously. In that way, you can always have a second controller ready to go if the one you're currently using runs out of battery. It will also free up the USB ports on your PS5 for other accessories.</p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><p></p><p>Unless you spent very little time on the internet this year, it’s safe to say it was impossible to avoid the conversation around <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk3NDNGOFA2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd8W66VoNB9iJSflHamonuk4xav-Jhw3lxYEktm6iib1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09743F8P6"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. After putting about 100 hours into FromSoftware’s latest, I can safely say the praise is warranted. Like a lot of other people, I was tired of Western-style open-world games and their endless checklists by the time I got around to playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, but its take on the genre was anything but tired. As I stumbled my way through the game’s dark caves, ruined cathedrals and enchanted forests, I felt like there was a discovery waiting for me across every hill and river. That’s a feeling I haven’t had since I was a kid playing through the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Majora’s Mask</em>.</p><p>If that’s not enough to convince you to try <em>Elden Ring</em>, know that the game’s maximalist approach makes it the most approachable FromSoftware release to date. Whenever you’re stuck on a boss, you can go elsewhere to level your character and master the game’s punishing combat.</p><h2>God of War Ragnarök</h2><p></p><p>Did you think Sony’s latest exclusive would be absent from this list? <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI2MjI4WEJNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWU0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWB-8RmbELIUhSVL_uxLOsQsgLE0eT4x8vn_FBO_sQiw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B6228XBM"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>can sometimes suffer from pacing issues and <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWNaZ2pSY1lHa1k4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdcGQ3XvwH9yNNLchoRgVNYPN6BZR9BAgpmTFqAmqmZN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcZgjRcYGkY8">overly chatty NPCs</a>, but there’s no denying that Santa Monica Studio has crafted another heartfelt chapter in the story of Kratos and Atreus. The PS5 is also the best place to play <em>Ragnarök</em>. On Sony’s latest console, the game ships with two rendering modes and support for variable and high frame rates. Provided you own a relatively recent TV, those features make it possible to play the action RPG at up to 90 frames per second in some situations. That’s a level of technical proficiency we haven’t seen in a lot of AAA console games.</p><h2><em>Death's Door</em></h2><p></p><p>With a title that evokes the end of all things, you might think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deaths-door-playstation-november-23-213345948.html"><em>Death's Door</em></a> is a bleak game. But that couldn't be further from the truth. Buoyed by a beautiful soundtrack and art style, it's one of the most thoughtful and pleasant <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003808">indies</a> I've played recently. Developer Acid Nerve's tribute to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> is a must-play for those who love to lose themselves in a world of mystery and intrigue.</p><h2><em>Ghosts of Tsushima Directors Cut</em></h2><p></p><p>You've played games like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOThHMzRHQlQvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1lNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjQ1ZTBkYmEtOWZmOC00OWQ4LTlkNDUtOWE3MTRlMzU0NjMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAb0q4LpzjYdGDVdzqmqDuVTg8J-TQzQipz93ANEYN1j2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB098G34GBT%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> before. It borrows from the familiar open-world formula popularized by Assassin's Creed and other Ubisoft titles. But that's not a knock against it. Far from it, Sucker Punch's latest is so easy to recommend because it executes the open-world concept flawlessly. The studio has created a beautiful playground steeped in Feudal Japanese culture, myth and history for players to explore, with something interesting to find beyond every ridge. Combat is also a highlight, allowing you to play either as honorable samurai, terrifying assassin or a mixture of both. And once you have finished Tsushima's touching single-player story, there's the excellent Legends multiplayer mode to keep you busy for the long haul.</p><h2><em>Hades</em></h2><p></p><p>If you pick up only one game from this list, make it <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvaGFkZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNDVlMGRiYS05ZmY4LTQ5ZDgtOWQ0NS05YTcxNGUzNTQ2MzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXFbbN3TBBisIy41PK6evbjUAQi7PY5KX6t2-pUY7U1a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fhades%2F"><em>Hades</em></a>.

Even if you're not a fan of roguelike games, don't worry: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-hades-early-access-believer.html"><em>Hades</em></a> is so successful because even when you die, it never feels like you've wasted your time.</p>

<p>As we approach the end of the year, it’s time for Engadget to wrap up the successes and failures in tech from the last twelve months. While it might be easier point out the messes made by the likes of crypto, Google’s Stadia cloud gaming platform and, ugh, Twitter, there were some highlights too. These include the eventual arrival of Steam’s handheld gaming PC, all those Wordle options, and some dazzling new views of space. The worst of 2022 centers an awful lot on tech bros, if you hadn’t rolled your eyes at them enough in the preceding years. From the collapse of FTX to the precarious state of Twitter, it’s been a mess. Meanwhile,  the likes of Peloton have struggled to hold onto their pandemic user base, and Toyota’s EV efforts haven’t been great.

The outlet also notes Amazon may decide to shelve the app. Amazon did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. Earlier this month, Google reportedly agreed to pay between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion for the NFL’s Sunday Ticket package.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-reportedly-creating-standalone-sports-app-173434609.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/movanos-evie-is-a-medical-grade-smart-ring-143638956.html">The Evie is a smart ring designed 'for women'</a></h2><h3>It can measure heart rate, clinical SpO2, skin temperature variability and more.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/movanos-evie-is-a-medical-grade-smart-ring-143638956.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/6a8df7a0-876c-11ed-8f7f-e88f3d4d2b58" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Evie</div></figure></a><p>Health company Movano has teased its first smart ring, the Evie, designed for health, fitness and cycle tracking.

The next best tool for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease is a blood test. While some tests can detect abnormal tau protein counts as a possible indicator of Alzheimer’s disease, they’re less effective at spotting the telltale signs of neurodegeneration. But this week, in the journal <em>Brain</em>, a multinational team of researchers from Sweden, Italy, the UK and US detailed a new antibody-based blood test that can detect brain-derived tau proteins specific to Alzheimer’s disease. Following a study of 600 patients, the team found their test could reliably distinguish the illness from other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/researchers-develop-blood-test-detects-alzheimers-disease-224320271.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>

<p>CES 2023 is nearly here, which means we're <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-family-hub-refrigerator-jetbot-90-smart-home-appliances-ces-2021-140047669.html">once again</a> writing about Samsung smart refrigerators.

That allows you to display family or other photos on the refrigerator, or upload photos to a mobile device from the Family Hub Plus. As before, you can also display artwork from Samsung's Bespoke Atelier app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung's upcoming smart fridge has a massive 32-inch display" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/30bbf1a0-876a-11ed-bc28-e6b1ef502e75" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The built-in hub can control multiple SmartThings devices, giving you a smart home control center on a very large touchscreen. It also supports six SmartThings Home Life services: air care, home care, pet care, clothing care, energy, and cooking. Samsung has also included Samsung TV Plus, giving US users 190 TV channels for free. You can use it in the vertical orientation for TikTok, Facebook Shorts and other social media content, or employ picture-in-picture mode to view videos and do other tasks at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, it supports Amazon's Your Essentials service, letting you order groceries and other products directly from the touchscreen.

Its 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen also looks more expansive than the previous Air's due to Apple bumping up its brightness to 500 nits and making its bezel a bit thinner. To note, we found its display to be on par with the more expensive 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, except without Apple's ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The Air also comes with the larger MacBook Pros' improved speaker technology that supports Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos. In addition, it has the same keyboard and trackpad as the Pro laptops' and comes with two USB-C ports, as well as a MagSafe connector for power. During our tests, the Air lasted for 16 hours and 30 minutes on a single charge — enough time to get through a day's work.

<p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-video-and-ranking-perks-arrive-to-paying-blue-subscribers-125538009.html">Twitter</a> users reported having issues accessing the website tonight on <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/">Downdetector</a>. Based on people's reports, the outage started just before 7PM Eastern time and reached its peak at around 7:44PM. We haven't had any issues from our end, but reports continued well into the night and (as of this writing) is still ongoing for some users. Downdetector reports also indicate that most people have had issues accessing the website itself — only a fraction had problems loading the social network through its apps.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/29/twitter-users-report-global-outage-with-many-unable-to-log-into-website-or-app"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, users who couldn't access the website were met with a message that read "something went wrong, but don't fret — it's not your fault." Twitter has yet to issue an official statement for the outage. The Twitter Support account hasn't tweeted about it, and when some users posted about Twitter being broken, Elon Musk responded that he wasn't having any trouble loading the social network.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c9b3d8af37354d09b4f55fc5cc14ab16"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Works for me</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608273870901096454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>On Christmas Eve, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1606624671100997634">revealed</a> that he had disconnected one of Twitter's more sensitive server racks, but that the social network still works.
