<p>I am quite stubborn in a lot of ways but one in particular is when I'm guiding a team member on something I like to explain the workings so that there is a high level understanding of how things are working.<p>In the last couple years, I've been dipping my toes into other areas for 'hobby' time and wanting to know how things I use & like work.<p>A great example is the machine learning: An immediate google gets you as far as 'install these 10x libs' then write this.<p>When you dig into the OS of those libraries they're overwhelming and the documentation is never focused on the underlying functionality, which I personally am giddy to learn.<p>I find myself having to go with trial and error, I hate this because the wheel has already been invented. Maybe I'm missing a resource.<p>It feels these tutorials are just tutorials in libraries.<p>I know source code IS the workings, is there a resource other than source code I'm missing ?</p>

## Ask HN: The ISP has a competing product so has decided to block my domain

<p>The ISP in my hometown (Albania + Kosovo) has decided to block my whole domain to my free legal streaming website because they also happen to offer IPTV services. I only found out after trying to access my site from Albania today, it just comes up with a “bad URL” request. The streams I serve on my site are public freely available TV channels, combined into a single page.<p>Since EU laws do not apply to neither of these countries, is there any course of action I can take to prevent this sort of monopoly going on?</p>

## Tell HN: It's easier and faster to pirate an e-book, than it is to buy it

<p>The end of the year is coming, and I have some funds left from my company learning budget. I wanted to give it back to some of the authors that still help me in my developer journey, by buying some of their work online and hopefully contributing to their income, but the following happened:<p>1. I went to Amazon, since I have a kindle and didn't want to buy physical books. Amazon doesn't have a shopping card for kindle books, so I started buying them one by one. My company uses Spendesk for managing funds, so for each of the purchase I created a new virtual card and bought them.
After a few minutes my Amazon account is blocked for suspicious activity, and ALL my kindle library is wiped, and the funds are returned to my company.<p>2. Not wanting to give up, I go to a different online store, Thalia, to buy the books again. After buying them, I download the files, which are in an .acsm format, and can only be opened on the Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software. Once opened, an .epub file is downloaded, and even though I can't transfer the files to my kindle on ADE, I download Calibre to transfer them. Once I try opening them on Calibre, I get an error message saying the files are protected by DRM.
Funnily enough, it's possible to remove this DRM protection, but it's also not something completely legal, and makes me question why did I decide to legally buy the e-books in the first place.<p>After spending hours trying to buy e-books, having my Amazon account blocked, and downloading files that can't be transferred to my Kindle, the only conclusion I come to, is that I'm never buying e-books again.</p>

<p>Today's internet is filled with dopamine wells of content. I wanted to steer away from that and foster meaningful writing. So I made a site where you can only have a single post. The intention is to encourage thoughtful posts like the blogs we all love here at HN (Paul Graham's, fasterthanlime, Bartosz Ciechanowski's, etc).<p>For now posts are only markdown, but I intend to make some markdown extensions to make posts more dynamic.</p>

## Ask HN: Wanting to grow – what questions should you ask yourself?

<p>If this ends up dead and nothing more than a semi-introspective rant, so be it, served its purpose.<p>I started programming when I was 16. I am now over twice that and still programming. I don't like the realities of day-to-day software engineering. I cannot shake the feeling that I've spent the last 16 years doing it just because of... inertia. The 16-year old me just liked to hack around, learn fast, write shoddy scripts that pushed the limits of what I knew. So I know nothing about windows internals but I'd like to write some cheats for a game I'm playing? Let's dive in. And I loved it.<p>But I never had any love for the "art" of programming. I can, however, say with some confidence that I have a good sense of what makes a good, clean, sustainable solution - but the answer to that question isn't even a matter of programming, but of humans and how we work, and how we use our brains. You know, it's the old "you're too dumb to debug smart code in an emergency at 2AM". This can be extended to 95% of problems in my eyes. We need to be nice to other human beings working with us - that may be other people, or even may be me, but 3 months from now, tired, trying to hit a deadline or find a bug.<p>I digress, but I think I'm trying to convey the point that... I never really felt at home in my job. It all seemed off. And I have trouble figuring out where the problem lies.<p>Have you had moments where you did a sober double take and decided to alter your course or commit to it and stay on it? Heck, maybe close the laptop altogether.<p>I know this topic comes up every once in a while, and the usual answer seems to be burn out, but hopefully I can put a spin on it by focusing on what questions a person can ask themselves to better figure out what they want out of their job in the short, medium and long term.<p>What questions would you say one can ask themselves to really get to the bottom of it?</p>

<p>It used to be exciting in the 2010s to research prototypes and leaks. I waited in the cold for the early iPhones for hours on end. But now obsessing over these things feels hollow and gauche.</p>

## Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring #3 Founding Engineer in London

<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering.
