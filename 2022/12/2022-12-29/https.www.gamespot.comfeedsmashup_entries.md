<p>Silent Hill 2 is one of the most acclaimed survival-horror games of all time, standing out as <em>the </em>signature game of the series despite countless follow-ups and attempts to recapture that magic. Now, Konami is doing what we all knew was inevitable: a full Silent Hill 2 remake. Announced in late 2022, the game is coming to both PS5 and PC, introducing a horror masterpiece to a new generation of players. Here's what we know about the Silent Hill 2 remake so far, including release information, the story, the development team, and more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Release date</h2><p dir="ltr">Konami has not yet announced a release date or even a release year for the Silent Hill 2 remake. From this, we can infer it is likely not going to be anytime soon. A 2023 release isn't out of the question, but we'll have to wait and see for the publisher to provide concrete details.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Platforms</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4079573-5406253589-ss_a1.jpg"><img alt="Of course it'll have Pyramid Head." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15971423/4079573-5406253589-ss_a1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Of course it'll have Pyramid Head.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the other big upcoming horror remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a>, Silent Hill 2 will be a PS5 console exclusive. The game will only be available on PS5 and PC (via Steam). Because it is being made in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/10/19/silent-hill-2-remake-revealed-first-gameplay-details-and-design-changes-announced/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, last-generation systems are out of the question, and it should be able to take better advantage of the newer system's horsepower.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-everything-we-know/1100-6510211/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## FFXIV In 2022, A Retrospective

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078914-image.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Another year draws to a close. Countless glams were made. Duty roulettes were run. Too many creative ways of saying hello ("hi," "o/," "meowdy," "\o/") were typed out in rushed clacks. 2022 in Final Fantasy XIV was much like any other year, but while a lot of the old rituals stayed the same, we embarked on new vacations: farming and animal husbandry in Island Sanctuary, sparring with familiar gods, and visiting The Thirteenth shard.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-that-i-cant-deny/1900-6417806/">Endwalker</a> released in December 2021, putting a period to the struggle between Hydaelyn and Zodiark. Since then, main scenario quests have so far have felt like exposition--preparation for adventures in The Thirteenth shard to fully unfurl in upcoming updates. But 2022 brought a lot of other side-adventures and reworkings. The FFXIV team revamped the <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/features/ffxiv-community-eulogy-praetorium-castrum-meridianum-such-devastation/?fbclid=IwAR3D6A2jJxnLwXeAArVEoG_g2sIsIFJkK4dAHOGXUjzRXvGERDJ9A8LrFoQ">infamous Castrum Meridianium and Praetorium</a> (two duties that used to be infamously lengthy), added the Pandaemonium raids, and, for the more intense players, added the new ultimate, Dragonsong's Reprise.</p><p dir="ltr">Below we've recapped Final Fantasy XIV in 2022. We hope reflecting on them brings you a bit of joy, and maybe even inspires you to share some of your own in the comments below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Visit to The Thirteenth, Also Known as The Void</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078915-thirteenthshard.jpg" /><br /><em>A Visit to The Thirteenth, Also Known as The Void</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">6.1 took players to The Thirteenth shard, making it the second shard the Warrior of Light has visited. In Shadowbringers, players went to The First. But in contrast to the First, where it was overrun by light, The Thirteenth shard is consumed by darkness. From what we've seen of The Thirteenth so far, it's been The Gang versus Evil Goths. There are fantastic castle designs, cackling villains (Scarmiglione), and one very memorable trial featuring Barbariccia. Zero, Zenos' reaper avatar and voidsent, also becomes our tour guide into The Void. She'll likely continue to play an important role in future updates.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>We Didn’t Quite Retire From Combat, Yet</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078911-aglaia.jpg" /><br /><em>We Didn’t Quite Retire From Combat, Yet</em><br /><h3><p> We always fight something extremely overpowered and larger-than-life as the warrior of light, but this year, some very familiar gods challenged us during the new Alliance Raid called Aglaia. Gods from The Twelve pantheon made an appearance, including Azemya, Byregot, and more. The Twelve worshiped by Eorzea have long remained mysterious, so it's exciting to finally learn more about them and who they actually are. It's suggested that players will uncover the pantheon's true identity through the course of the raid series.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Zenos Chicken</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078905-zenos.jpg" /><br /><em>The Zenos Chicken</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">RIP Zenos. He's <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/ffxiv-zenos-story-needs-no-further-embellishment/">supposedly dead</a>, but the community keeps him alive with real-life alter egos--including this majestic animal. During promotions for Island Sanctuary's launch, the FFXIV team partnered with a farm called Mudchute. For a week, livestreams of the farm's animals appeared--and one chicken reminded players of Zenos with its lofty perch and arrogant plumage. The farm <a href="https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-14-fans-mudchute-farm-island-sanctuaries-zenos-the-rooster/">ended up officially naming the chicken Zenos</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cottagcore Era In Island Sanctuary</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078906-ffxivgallery4.jpg" /><br /><em>Cottagcore Era In Island Sanctuary</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Did you keep your farm animals <em>pleasantly stuffed</em> this year? Island Sanctuary was added in Patch 6.2 and much like the name implies, provided an opportunity for players to start a farm on a random island procured by the ever-enterprising Tataru. All resources are essentially contained to the Island, and more importantly, it's also where you can get the <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/ffxiv-item/isle-farmhands-cutoffs/">great farming jean shorts</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Adventure Plates (And Expanded Wardrobe)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078913-adventureplate.jpg" /><br /><em>Adventure Plates (And Expanded Wardrobe)</em><br /><h3><p> Adventure Plates are like profile pics, and arguably, can be considered a minor update, but shoutout to everybody who refused to chill and created silly, exaggerated, creative, and scrumptious character portraits. I can't tag some of the more wonderful ones I appreciated here due to… reasons, but just know they're great. We also received <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/ffxiv-increases-glamour-dresser-to-800-slots-in-patch-6-2/">more wardrobe slots</a> (400 more!), a very welcome update in the eyes of many players.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lahabrea's Backstory</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4078910-lahabrea.jpg" /><br /><em>Lahabrea's Backstory</em><br /><h3><p>Lahabrea, the star villain in A Realm Reborn, got the backstory treatment in the Pandaemonium raids. Not that Lahabrea was entirely one-dimensional prior to the Pandaemonium storyline, but the new (old?) family drama certainly provided more flesh on a guy who was most notable for the scathing "Pathetic" line delivered during Praetorium. To some players, Lahabrea became the favorite FFXIV guy of the month. For more, you can read a <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/features/the-thirst-for-lahabrea-goes-deeper-than-pandaemoniums-depths-ffxiv/">deep-dive on the Lahabrea thirst</a> that went on.</p></h3></p><br />

## Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny: Everything We Know About Harrison Ford's Return To The Franchise

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075270-indianajonestitlelogo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As hard as it might be to believe (and it's pretty difficult, if we're being honest), a fifth Indiana Jones movie, dubbed The Dial of Destiny, is coming fairly soon. As is usually the case in Hollywood, there's no such thing as letting sleeping dogs lie with these huge brands.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones has become one of our longest-winded major franchises, with the first three films spanning the 1980s ('81-89), followed by a fourth movie decades later in 2008. But that film, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, was not well received and these days is thought of in the same light as the Star Wars prequels--not the most flattering comparison.</p><p dir="ltr">In Crystal Skull, Indy was ostensibly passing the torch to a successor Mutt, his secret son with Mario Ravenwood who was played by one Shia LeBeouf. Said passing of the torch never ended up materializing after that film, with LeBeouf falling from his status as a hot up-and-comer in the years since. It looked for a while that that would simply be that for the Indiana Jones franchise, but here we are, 14 years later, with The Dial of Destiny and a new heir-apparent to the hat and whip.</p><p dir="ltr">But we'll get to that later. There's so much to talk about with regards to this movie, and the new Indy Jr is just one part of it. So let's dig in. Here's everything we know so far about what's in store for us with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Is there a trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075267-oldindianajones.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Yes! <a href="https://youtu.be/ZfVYgWYaHmE">You can watch it right here</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>When can we watch Indiana Jones 5?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075263-indy5ball.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After all sorts of delays, The Dial of Destiny has settled on a June 30, 2023 release.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Is Stephen Spielberg directing?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075264-indy5traintobyjones.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">No. Indy 5 comes from James Mangold, the director of Logan, one of the best Marvel movies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>What's a Dial of Destiny and what does it do?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075273-isthisadialofdestiny.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>No idea. It's a nebulous concept and the trailer provided few clues. Could this thing have something to do with it? </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Will Shia LeBeouf be in it?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075261-indianajonesmuttshia.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Not that we know of.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Who IS coming back?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075268-youngindianajones1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Does a digitally de-aged, 30-years-younger-version of Harrison Ford count as a cast member separate from current Harrison Ford? We'll let you debate that one.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Harrison Ford as Indys of various ages, the only past cast member confirmed to return is John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, who appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. So no Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, who Indy married at the end of the last movie. No Jim Broadbent as whoever it was he played in the last one. And, as previously mentioned, no Shia LeBeouf.</p><p dir="ltr">And, perhaps most frustrating of all given his award-winning turn in Everything Everywhere All At Once, Ke Huy Quan will not be reprising his role as Short Round.</p><p dir="ltr">As far as we know, of course.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Who else is in the cast of Indiana Jones 5?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075265-indy5phoebewallerbridge.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Aside from Ford and Rhys-Davies, we've got a stacked cast of new characters, starting with Mads Mikkelson as Voller, the main baddie, and Boyd Holbrook as his enforcer Klaber. Toby Jones, Antonio Banderas and Thomas Kretschmann will also have parts to play. A seven-foot-tall Dutch bodybuilder named Olivier Richters will presumably play a bad guy Indy will have to defeat in some kind of dryly funny way.</p><p dir="ltr">But most importantly of all, we've got Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Indiana Jones's goddaughter, new partner in crime, and likely new heir to the whip and fedora from here.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Will the events of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull even be acknowledged?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075262-indycrystalskull.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We have no idea. But it's a smart bet there'll at least be a joke or two about it. Maybe Indy can hide in another refrigerator.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>So what's Indy 5 about?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4075266-indy5mads.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We don't have a lot of details, but the film is said to use the space race of the 1960s as its backdrop, with the villainous Voller being based on Wernher Von Braun, the famous Nazi rocket scientist who got to live a plum life working at NASA after World War II. So this time, it looks like the call is coming from inside the house.</p><p dir="ltr">The first trailer was one of those "flash a bunch of context-free cool shots" affairs, so it wasn't really illuminating at all about plot details. But it's clear that there will be flashback scenes with a digitally de-aged Harrison Ford, and a brief shot of Voller in full Nazi uniform makes us think these two knew each other back in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">One other thing we do know for sure: one big action set piece will take place during the New York City ticker tape parade celebrating the return of astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins from the Apollo 11 mission--the first manned mission to land on the moon in 1969. Apparently Indy's never too old to get into an exciting horse chase.</p></h3></p><br />
