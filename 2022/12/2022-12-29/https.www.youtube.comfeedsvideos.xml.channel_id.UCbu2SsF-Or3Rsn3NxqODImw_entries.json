We go through 10 of the biggest finds in chronological order players have discovered this year.\n\nDiscoveries include exploring outer space, transmuting materials, holding impossible to hold items, Bokoblins stealing your horse, breaking open metal chests, diving deep under water, and much more complex glitches based off of IST, or Inventory Slot Transfer. Inventory Slot Transfer initiated a sort of renaissance for Breath of the Wild players and players then discovered more sub glitches based off of it, such as playing the game after you completed the game called Blue Hyrule, Direct Inventory Corruption, and Weapon Modifier Corruption, creating custom weapons and modifiers with powerful special abilities.\n\n2022 was a major year for Breath of the Wild, and many players contributed to finding and sharing these amazing glitches. We're now just waiting to see what the sequel Tears of the Kingdom will bring to the table after a long 6 years in the oven. If you enjoy Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom content, make sure to stick around, as we continue to cover Zelda today and will bring you the latest when it drops.
