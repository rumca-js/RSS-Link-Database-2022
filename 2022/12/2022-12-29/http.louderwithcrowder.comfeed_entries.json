Few do, and the ones who don't live vicariously through others. Audiences cheered when Jerry McGuire (and Jim Breuer) promised he wasn't going to do what we all thought he was going to do. Fans cheered when \"Stone Cold\" Steven Austin dropped Vince McMahon like the Board of Directors did twenty-five years later. And anyone who has ever worked in retail feels this lady's rant. Not sure what Walmart it is.

Where whoever scores the most woke points by the end of the year wins a prize. Because Cameron looks like he's in competition.

The filmmaker also can't understand why we don't see six-month pregnant women fighting bad guys in movies.</p><p>(It is unclear if James Cameron has ever met a woman who is six months pregnant. WikiPedia says he's been married five times and has four kids. But it's also Hollywood, so none of that means anything.)</p><p>Though Cameron has a high bar of wokeness to vault over. This is the man who once said <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-cameron-wonder-woman\" target=\"_blank\">Gal Gadot was too hot</a> for <em>Wonder Woman</em> to be a feminist movie. A virtue he was so proud of signaling, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-cameron-doubles-wonder-woman-hot-feminist\" target=\"_blank\">he doubled down on it</a>.</p><p>James Cameron is the latest lefty who made a fortune on gun movies wanting us to believe how embarrassed he is he made a fortune making gun movies.

Could there be a collection of emails and Slack screen captures exposing various media outlets? That's to be determined.</p><p>It just always cracks me up how corporate media refuses to believe they have anything to do with their reputation. As if it's only Trumpers and right-wing wackjobs who think they suck at life. The reality is it's the far-right, the center-right, RINOS, moderates, the establishment, the consultant class, independents, libertarians, and apolitical people. The only group that DOESN'T seem to think corporate media deserves its reputation as the least trusted institution in America is the far-left which relies on them to spread their narrative.</p><p>Corporate media earned their sh*tty reputation all on their own.
