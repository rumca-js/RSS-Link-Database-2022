member on something I like to explain the workings so that there is a high level understanding of how things are working.<p>In the last couple years, I've been dipping my toes into other areas for 'hobby' time and wanting to know how things I use & like work.<p>A great example is the machine learning: An immediate google gets you as far as 'install these 10x libs' then write this.<p>When you dig into the OS of those libraries they're overwhelming and the documentation is never focused on the underlying functionality, which I personally am giddy to learn.<p>I find myself having to go with trial and error, I hate this because the wheel has already been invented. Maybe I'm missing a resource.<p>It feels these tutorials are just tutorials in libraries.<p>I know source code IS the workings, is there a resource other than source code I'm missing ?</p>\n<hr

I wanted to give it back to some of the authors that still help me in my developer journey, by buying some of their work online and hopefully contributing to their income, but the following happened:<p>1. I went to Amazon, since I have a kindle and didn't want to buy physical books. Amazon doesn't have a shopping card for kindle books, so I started buying them one by one. My company uses Spendesk for managing funds, so for each of the purchase I created a new virtual card and bought them.\nAfter a few minutes my Amazon account is blocked for suspicious activity, and ALL my kindle library is wiped, and the funds are returned to my company.<p>2. Not wanting to give up, I go to a different online store, Thalia, to buy the books again. After buying them, I download the files, which are in an .acsm format, and can only be opened on the Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software. Once opened, an .epub file is downloaded, and even though I can't transfer the files to my kindle on ADE, I download Calibre to transfer them. Once I try opening them on Calibre, I get an error message saying the files are protected by DRM.\nFunnily enough, it's possible to remove this DRM protection, but it's also not something completely legal, and makes me question why did I decide to legally buy the e-books in the first place.<p>After spending hours trying to buy e-books, having my Amazon account blocked, and downloading files that can't be transferred to my Kindle, the only conclusion I come to, is that I'm never buying e-books again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172506\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172506</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172506", "date_published": "2022-12-29 13:44:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Pressn't, a site where you can only have a single post", "description": "<p>Today's internet is filled with dopamine wells of content.

I am now over twice that and still programming. I don't like the realities of day-to-day software engineering. I cannot shake the feeling that I've spent the last 16 years doing it just because of... inertia. The 16-year old me just liked to hack around, learn fast, write shoddy scripts that pushed the limits of what I knew. So I know nothing about windows internals but I'd like to write some cheats for a game I'm playing? Let's dive in. And I loved it.<p>But I never had any love for the \"art\" of programming. I can, however, say with some confidence that I have a good sense of what makes a good, clean, sustainable solution - but the answer to that question isn't even a matter of programming, but of humans and how we work, and how we use our brains. You know, it's the old \"you're too dumb to debug smart code in an emergency at 2AM\". This can be extended to 95% of problems in my eyes. We need to be nice to other human beings working with us - that may be other people, or even may be me, but 3 months from now, tired, trying to hit a deadline or find a bug.<p>I digress, but I think I'm trying to convey the point that... I never really felt at home in my job. It all seemed off. And I have trouble figuring out where the problem lies.<p>Have you had moments where you did a sober double take and decided to alter your course or commit to it and stay on it? Heck, maybe close the laptop altogether.<p>I know this topic comes up every once in a while, and the usual answer seems to be burn out, but hopefully I can put a spin on it by focusing on what questions a person can ask themselves to better figure out what they want out of their job in the short, medium and long term.<p>What questions would you say one can ask themselves to really get to the bottom of it?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172101\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172101</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172101", "date_published": "2022-12-29 12:50:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Luck based medicine: my resentful story of becoming a medical miracle", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fFY2HeC9i2Tx8FEnK/luck-based-medicine-my-resentful-story-of-becoming-a-medical\">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fFY2HeC9i2Tx8FEnK/luck-based-medicine-my-resentful-story-of-becoming-a-medical</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172092\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34172092</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fFY2HeC9i2Tx8FEnK/luck-based-medicine-my-resentful-story-of-becoming-a-medical", "date_published": "2022-12-29 12:49:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Lingua Graeca Per Se Illustrata", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://seumasjeltzz.github.io/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata/\">https://seumasjeltzz.github.io/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34171863\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34171863</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://seumasjeltzz.github.io/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata/", "date_published": "2022-12-29 12:11:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: Why is the wait for the new iPhone or gadget not as rousing as before?", "description": "<p>It used to be exciting in the 2010s to research prototypes and leaks.

We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34170257\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34170257</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments:
