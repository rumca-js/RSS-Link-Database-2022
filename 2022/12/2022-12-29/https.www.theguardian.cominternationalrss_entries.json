He caught it on his chest, stunning it so smartly that the ball dropped at his feet. He stepped over the ball and effortlessly back-heeled it to a team mate. With the crowd still cheering this, the ball was lobbed back into the area and, insouciantly, Pel\u00e9 flicked it with the side of his head into the goal. Within moments, Brazil had<strong> </strong>won their first World Cup, making the nation\u2019s identity, then better known for coffee, synonymous with football. Pel\u00e9, reduced to floods of tears on the pitch, began his life as the embodiment of Brazilian football.</p><p>It is worth recalling how much was riding on this moment for Brazil. The country\u2019s scintillating Afro-Brazilian stars, such as Le\u00f4nidas, first caught the world\u2019s attention at the 1938 World Cup. Commentators at the time suggested that the country\u2019s hybrid Afro-Indian-European demography was the greatest strength behind its football and culture. The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was meant to cement this notion, but the shock defeat to Uruguay in the final game <em>\u2013</em> the<em> </em><em>Maracanazo </em><em>\u2013 </em>was read as a failure of the country\u2019s modernisation and its pathological miscegenation; the black players were made scapegoats for the defeat and racist stereotypes were reactivated. In 1958 the curse was lifted. Brazil\u2019s super-diverse squad had become champions playing in their own unique style; Pel\u00e9 was the star, and the world took notice.</p><p>David Goldblatt is the author of The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football and The Game of Our Lives</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/29/pele-football-greatness-brazil-global-star\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/29/israel-swears-in-benjamin-netanyahu-amid-fears-of-further-slide-to-right", "title": "Israel swears in Benjamin Netanyahu amid concerns of further slide to right", "date_published": "2022-12-29 20:10:43+00:00", "description": "<p>Arab citizens and LGBTQ+ community fear return of veteran leader will damage democracy</p><p>Israel\u2019s most rightwing cabinet ever has been sworn in, with Benjamin Netanyahu heading an administration that could open the door to fervently nationalist and religious politicians to radicalise the country and policies towards the Palestinians.</p><p>Israeli liberals fear the veteran leader\u2019s return to power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-rightwing-government\">in alliance with anti-Arab, ultranationalist and ultraorthodox parties</a> will damage democratic aspects of the country\u2019s governance.
