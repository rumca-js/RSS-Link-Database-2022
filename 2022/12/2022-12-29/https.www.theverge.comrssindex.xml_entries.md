  <p id="XjkzWu">Steam, the PC gaming platform, is making its way around town as part of Tesla’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23508269/tesla-holiday-update-steam-apple-music-support-light-show-mode">latest holiday update</a>. It fulfills a promise Tesla CEO Elon Musk made almost two years ago: that you’ll be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop">play <em>The Witcher 3</em></a><em> </em>using the car’s built-in hardware. But unfortunately for me, I won’t get to play it, and it doesn’t look like there will be any easy path toward upgrading.</p>
<p id="HFtECe">I have a 2018 Tesla Model 3, and I think I should mention it’s received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885822/tesla-software-version-10-now-available-features-netflix-youtube-spotify">plenty of upgrades over the years</a>, including overhauled user interface, Autopilot visualizations, streaming apps, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars">arcade games</a>. But in my car, all of Tesla’s fancy new software is running on the Intel Atom — a processor designed for cheap netbooks from the previous decade (Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388238/asus-eee-pc-netbook-laptop-line-linux-ipad-pro">the Eee PC</a>?).

  <p id="lXRJjS">A fresh batch of leaked renders allegedly show an upcoming Samsung device in a range of flashy colors.

But what’s <em>really</em> exciting are the color options: Lime! Purple! Pearlescent! If these renders are accurate, then we could see a more colorful outlook for budget phones in 2023, and it’s about damn time.</p>

  <p id="5JwiRs">CES 2023 is now just days away, and there’s already a standout category that we’re particularly excited about: 240Hz OLED gaming monitors.</p>
<p id="K58Gma">Generally speaking, OLED panels can achieve better picture quality and a faster response time than their LED or IPS equivalents but have historically lacked the ability to match them in providing high-refresh rates. There have been some exceptions — such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23011794/alienware-aw3423dw-review-qd-oled-curved-gaming-pc-monitor">Alienware AW3423DW</a>, a QD-OLED running at 175Hz — but now, OLED gaming displays have finally achieved the optimal 240Hz refresh rate prized by gamers who specialize in eSports and FPS titles.</p>

  <p id="oTVdIF">New York governor Kathy Hochul signed the Digital Fair Repair Act on December 28th, 2022, and the law will go into effect on July 1st, 2023 — a full year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/3/23153504/right-to-repair-new-york-state-law-ifixit-repairability-diy">it was originally passed by the NY State legislature</a>. The bill establishes that consumers and independent repair providers have a right to obtain manuals, diagrams, diagnostics and parts from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in order to repair their own devices. However, the bill was meaningfully compromised at the last minute by amendments that give OEMs some convenient exceptions and loopholes to get out of obligations that many right to repair advocates had been hoping for.</p>

<p id="cRB2yH">The reason this happens is that people are increasingly sharing HDR (high dynamic range) videos on social platforms — whether they know it or not — and when your fancy smartphone plays them, the display goes into overdrive to showcase, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/adjust-hdr-camera-settings-iph2cafe2ebc/ios">in Apple’s words</a>, the “true-to-life color and contrast” made possible by HDR.
