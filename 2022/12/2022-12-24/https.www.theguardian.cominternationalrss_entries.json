The pandemic hurtled us from the end of one decade to the early years of another without pause for reflection, and we can\u2019t quite connect who we are now with who we were \u2013 or what the world was \u2013 in the Before Times. So it\u2019s fascinating that Aidan Cottrell-Boyce\u2019s thrillingly ambitious debut novel, The End of Nightwork, features a narrator who suffers from a rare hormonal condition that dramatically accelerates the ageing process. At 13, Pol finds he has undergone a \u201cheterochronous shock\u201d, ageing him 10 years overnight \u2013 and leaving him there. Now in his early 30s, married to teacher Caroline and living in Kilburn with their young son, Jesse, Pol still has the appearance of a sprightly 23-year-old. His fast-forwarded development feels strangely apt for our times.</p><p>The details of his sudden teenage transformation are startling: \u201cThey had to shave me every day, because the beard and body hair growth was so rapid it was getting in the way of the doctors who were trying to operate on me \u2026 They were trying to stop my head from growing too quickly.\u201d The medics were watching \u201ca boy turning into a man before their very eyes\u201d.
