<p>The runaway success of the Nintendo Switch might suggest that anything similar in form factor and price would perform just as well. But since its launch in 2017, there hasn't been anything that has captured the same type of attention as Nintendo's hybrid console. Valve, makers of stellar devices such as the Valve Index as well as equally unsuccessful products such as the Steam Controller and various Steam Machines (if you can even recall those), was a surprising new competitor in the space when it announced the Steam Deck. A handheld PC that could take your Steam library anywhere and everywhere sounded far too good to be true, but since its launch in February this year, it's been a device that's surprised time and time again.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a lot standing in the way of the Steam Deck's success initially. Back when it launched, Valve announced just over 100 games that were verified to be compatible with the Steam Deck, with only 60 of those achieving its highest level of compatibility. The Linux-based operating system and Proton--the translation layer games would make use of--seemed like it could ruin any chances for the Steam Deck before it really got going. But that didn't stop initial stock from being scooped up for preorder faster than most could react to, priming the Steam Deck for a big, and telling, launch.</p><p dir="ltr">When it did finally make its way into the hands of consumers, it was just the right amount of imperfect to be endearing. Yes, not every game in your library worked immediately, but that also didn't seem to matter when you could just as easily take games you were playing on a PS4 months prior and have them run surprisingly well on a handheld. Smaller titles shone on Valve's device, where hardware limitations were as much less of a factor for great performance and the form factor made playing these games more engaging than behind a monitor at a desk. The Steam Deck delivers on its promise to let you bring a large library of games with you on the go, while also enticing you to continue growing it within Valve's ecosystem.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-steam-deck-has-transformed-pc-gaming/1100-6509947/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I've faced down demons, giants, advanced alien species, and thanks to Japanese RPGs, I've attacked and dethroned my fair share of gods. But this year, Arcade Paradise encapsulated how sometimes, the smaller stakes of interpersonal conflict and intergenerational relationships can make a more memorable antagonist by feeling relatable and grounded.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Arcade Paradise spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Arcade Paradise's story begins very light and unassuming. As a young college dropout named Ashley, you occasionally get voicemails from your father, who put you in charge of a laundromat. There's some mild signs of strife between you two and slightly snide comments about how this job will help teach you some responsibility, but on the whole, it seems no more strained than any typical parent-child relationship.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade-paradise-shows-the-most-brutal-antagonists-can-be-the-most-mundane/1100-6510149/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
