  <p id="8ajUip">If you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777072/sony-ps5-playstation-5-console-where-how-to-buy-tips-restock">just bought a PlayStation 5</a>, there are a bunch of great games for you to play on that console. Since its release in late 2020, dozens of must-play games have appeared, including several console-exclusive games that you won’t be able to play anywhere else. </p>
<p id="a9GLdi">If you don’t have the cash to spend on a PS5, don’t worry. Due to the continued difficulty of finding PS5s in stock, Sony has released PS4 versions of some of its biggest 2022 titles, including <em>God of War Ragnorök</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. However, that trend may eventually fizzle out, with Sony shifting more of its focus to the newer, more powerful console.</p>
<p id="fQzAjC">I suggest checking out our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177015/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-launch-2020">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021">2021</a> lists for games to play on PlayStation if you need some extra...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="akDAnd">There’s more streaming competition than ever, but even still, Netflix remains on top when it comes to both breadth and scale. Put simply, there is <em>a lot</em> to watch on Netflix, to the point that even seemingly big-name series and films can get buried by the algorithm that’s trying to show you the latest in reality TV. So to help you out, we’ve curated 10 excellent new titles that run the gamut from zombie thrillers to stop-motion family movies to an incredible whodunit.</p>

  <p id="EOnMCp">Earlier this year, I wrote about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23194235/ai-fiction-writing-amazon-kindle-sudowrite-jasper">genre-fiction authors using AI</a> in their novels. Most wrote for Amazon’s Kindle platform, where an extremely rapid pace of publishing, as fast as a book a month, is the norm. AI helped them write quickly, but it also raised complex aesthetic and ethical questions. Would the widespread use of AI warp fiction toward the most common conventions and tropes? What parts of the writing process can be automated before the writing no longer feels like their own? Should authors have to disclose their use of AI?</p>
<p id="XA7gI7">With the debut of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499728/ai-capability-accessibility-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-commercialization">ChatGPT</a>, many of the questions these writers were dealing with have become more urgent and mainstream.

## Phone manufacturers: please give us the power button back

  <p id="L4TEwA">Every major phone manufacturer is guilty of a serious crime, and I won’t be quiet about it any longer: they stole the power button from us. Apple, Google, Samsung: guilty, guilty, guilty. </p>
<p id="nStSpC">Long-pressing the power button used to bring up an option to turn your phone off, but then these companies decided to <em>get cute</em> and make this a shortcut to summon their digital assistant. This is bad and wrong, and I’m politely demanding that these companies return what they took from us.</p>
<p id="jmT1WK">Look, I get the logic. When phone screens got bigger, physical buttons like Apple’s home button were axed, and existing buttons had to pick up the slack. In the iPhone X, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/30/20887679/iphone-x-power-button-evolution-smartphone-apple-siri-turn-on-off">Apple re-homed the Siri function</a> to the power button. Since then, turning your iPhone off has...</p>

## Mastodon 101: how to follow (and unfollow) other accounts

  <p id="rh5GlZ">The torrent of former tweeters streaming toward <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23429095/twitter-social-network-alternatives-mastodon-reddit-tumblr-cohost">alternative social networks</a> seems to be ongoing, and the social network that is probably gaining the most attention is Mastodon. This open-source network of independent servers (called “instances”) had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23518325/mastodon-monthly-active-users-twitter-elon-musk">jumped to 2.5 million users</a> between October and November — and is continuing its ascent. </p>
<p id="Ej2Fa4">Admittedly, there has been a bit of confusion among the new members of the Masto-set as to how it resembles Twitter and how it differs. To go through all the various permutations of how to really use Mastodon to its full capabilities would take more than a single article, and as a matter of fact, there are a variety of resources available (a few of which I’ll list at the end of this article).

  <p id="zMfI25">Gadgets, since time in memoriam, have worked a certain way. </p>
<p id="S08PtD">You, a company, release one. It’s good, but it’s not perfect. No gadget is perfect! So you do market research and focus groups. You figure out who’s buying. You figure out what they like and what they don’t like. You refine. You fix problems. </p>
<p id="CBRYtk">The next year, you release a version of that device that is objectively, concretely better. This is the next-gen device, the Device 2.0. You call this device an “upgrade.” You tell your customers to recycle Device 1.0 and replace it with Device 2.0. Some of them do. “Should you upgrade?” the tech bloggers write, calculating the pros and cons of doing so. </p>
