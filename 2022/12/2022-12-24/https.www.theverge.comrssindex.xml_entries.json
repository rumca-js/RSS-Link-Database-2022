Since its release in late 2020, dozens of must-play games have appeared, including several console-exclusive games that you won\u2019t be able to play anywhere else. </p>\n<p id=\"a9GLdi\">If you don\u2019t have the cash to spend on a PS5, don\u2019t worry. Due to the continued difficulty of finding PS5s in stock, Sony has released PS4 versions of some of its biggest 2022 titles, including <em>God of War Ragnor\u00f6k</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. However, that trend may eventually fizzle out, with Sony shifting more of its focus to the newer, more powerful console.</p>\n<p id=\"fQzAjC\">I suggest checking out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22177015/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-launch-2020\">2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021\">2021</a> lists for games to play on PlayStation if you need some extra...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23494185/playstation-ps5-ps4-games-best-2022-roundup\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/23483983/netflix-best-shows-2022", "title": "10 great shows from 2022 to stream on Netflix", "date_published": "2022-12-24 18:00:00+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3dnMGHsf8IRgA9jmHQeFhJc6ow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71790191/226437_M_Huigen_year_Netflix_best.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Micha Huigen / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"akDAnd\">There\u2019s more streaming competition than ever, but even still, Netflix remains on top when it comes to both breadth and scale.

Most wrote for Amazon\u2019s Kindle platform, where an extremely rapid pace of publishing, as fast as a book a month, is the norm. AI helped them write quickly, but it also raised complex aesthetic and ethical questions. Would the widespread use of AI warp fiction toward the most common conventions and tropes? What parts of the writing process can be automated before the writing no longer feels like their own? Should authors have to disclose their use of AI?</p>\n<p id=\"XA7gI7\">With the debut of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499728/ai-capability-accessibility-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-commercialization\">ChatGPT</a>, many of the questions these writers were dealing with have become more urgent and mainstream.
