Consumer Reports recently tested a bunch of dark chocolate for lead
and cadmium, and found that:

</span>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
For 23 of the bars, eating just an ounce a day would put an adult over
a level that public health authorities and CR's experts say may be
harmful for at least one of those heavy metals. Five of the bars were
above those levels for both cadmium and lead.
</blockquote>



<p>

If you regularly eat chocolate, how worried about this should you be?

</p>

<p>


Consumer Reports used <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/general-info/current-proposition-65-no-significant-risk-levels-nsrls-maximum">the
limits</a> from California's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_California_Proposition_65">Prop
65</a>, which you may recall from the "this thing contains chemicals
known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or
other reproductive harm" warnings that are all over everything in
CA. For both lead and cadmium Consumer Reports used the reproductive harm "maximum
allowable daily level" (MADL), which are 0.5 &#181;g/d and
4.1&#181;g/d respectively.

</p>

<p>

CA calculates these limits by looking at studies that try to find the
highest dose that has no observable effect (NOEL, "No Observable
Effect Level") or the lowest dose that does have one (LOEL, "Lowest
Observable Effect Level"), and estimating an effect threshold.  Then
they divide by 1,000 (as required by the <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/proposition-65/general-info/prop65ballot1986.pdf">original
proposition text</a>) to get the MADL limit.  For example, here's the
process they used for cadmium (<a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/cadmium20madl.pdf">pdf</a>).

</p>

<p>

A safety factor of 1,000 is large (though not nuts for converting from
a single dose to an ongoing exposure), so it's not surprising that
CA's limits are tighter than you see elsewhere.  For example, the
FDA's limits for lead are 3&#181;g/d for kids and 12.5&#181;g/d for
women who might become pregnant (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/157949/download">pdf</a>), 6x and 25x
the Prop 65 lead MADL.  The FDA translates this into a limit of 0.1
ppm for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-lead-candy-likely-be-consumed-frequently-small-children">candy
likely to be consumed by small children</a>, 5.7x the level Consumer
Reports used.  [1]

</p>

<p>

Similarly, for cadmium the CDC <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/cadmium/Safety-Standards.html">reports</a>
that the EPA limit (which I can't find on epa.gov) is for food is
1&#181;g/kg/d.  CA used a pregnant adult weight of 58 kg in their
cadmium calculation, so the equivalent from the EPA limit would be
58&#181;g/d, 14x the CA Prop 65 level.  Using 25kg for a child
weight would give 25&#181;g/d, 6.1x the Prop 65 cadmium MADL.

</p>

<p>

Putting these all on the same footing, assuming you're eating 1oz of
chocolate daily:

</p>

<p>

My overall interpretation is that while it's better to eat chocolate
with lower heavy metal content, all things being equal, these levels
are basically fine and it's not worth avoiding chocolate over.
The Consumer Reports findings seem alarming only because dividing by
1,000 in determining CA Prop 65 levels gives a super conservative
safety factor.

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] Consumer Reports used a limit of 0.5&#181;g/oz, which is
0.018&#181;g/g (the same as ppm).

## Non-Elevated Air Purifiers

Last year for Christmas gatherings at my dad's house I put together </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/elevated-air-purifier-cubes">wall-mounted filter cubes</a>,
to get them up and out of the way.  This time around this seemed like
too much hassle, so I put one together on top of the piano, one in a
bookcase, and used one commercial purifier:



<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/filters-on-piano-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="412" src="https://www.jefftk.com/filters-on-piano.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>


It's double-ended because I had an extra fan.  You do need to remember
to turn on both fans.  Probably would be slightly more effective if
I'd put a partition in the middle to make it actually be two
independent cubes.  I used the 12x20 filters from my <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/ceiling-air-purifier">ceiling fan air purifier</a> project.

</p>

<p>

The kitchen has a commercial purifier, which has a similar capacity to
the filter cubes while taking less space.  If I wanted to run these
all the time I might buy several commercial purifiers, but since these
are just for occasional use that seems less worth it.

</p>

<p>

<p>

For the living room, <a href="https://juliawise.net/">Julia</a> had
the clever idea of using a part of the built-in shelving that was
exactly the right size:

</p>

</p>

<p>

This is only two filters worth, but I still feel a lot of airflow from
the fans.  It's a good location for not being in the way, though we
did need to talk to the kids about leaving it alone since it would be
easily damaged if bumped.

</p>

<p>

I should make some shrouds for the fans.
