The pro-abortion lobby gives pro-abortion politicians millions of dollars. Those politicians find ways to make it illegal for citizens to peacefully protest outside of abortion clinics. If you want to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pro-abortion-activist-voice-mails\" target=\"_blank\">firebomb a Christian women's center</a>, that's \"illegal\" in the same way shoplifting in California is \"illegal.\" But don't you dare stand within x amount of yards outside of where they vacuum babies out of women holding a poster board.</p><p>But this woman wasn't even holding a sign. She was standing in silence. Police took photographs of her standing in silence, then confronted her with those photographs asking if she was in fact praying.</p><blockquote>When shown pictures of herself outside the abortion facility by police, Vaughan-Spruce was questioned as to whether she was praying in the photos. She said she could not answer \u2013 some of the time she had spent praying, other times she had been distracted and thought about other things, such as her lunch. She maintains that both of these thoughts were equally peaceful and imperceptible and that neither should be criminalised.  </blockquote><p>It tends to be frowned upon to start a blog post with \"yeah, I got nothing.\" But I'm at a loss here other than to say...this is how they do in the UK. In America, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-feds-twitter-seven\" target=\"_self\">our government works around free speech</a>...but we still have it kinda. In England, they don't.</p><p>Also, there are pro-abortion leftists in this country who will read this story and say \"you're damn right she should be arrested!\" Those people need to never be allowed power in America EVER.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Honolulu Christmas. A Pulp Fiction Christmas. A Muslim Christmas. </blockquote><p>Muslim Christmas?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"87d13\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32382873&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The rant continues...</p><blockquote>Moroccan Christmas. Mo Rocca Christmas. I don't want. it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.</blockquote><p>Then Stanley really goes off. I don't think he's been this upset since street construction outside canceled Pretzel Day.</p><blockquote>I don't want no Kwanza wreath. I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's its own thing. And who's that Black Santa for? I don't care. I know Santa ain't black. I could care less. I want Christmas. Just give me plain baby Jesus lying in a manger Christmas.</blockquote><p>Stanley tells no lies. For starters, I refuse to acknowledge Kwanza as a holiday until I meet a single person who celebrates it. And I am 99% sure no one in the office celebrates Hanukah. If they did, there would have been an episode where Michael Scott made things awkward with a bagel buffet, a copy of the <em>Complete Friar's Club Anthology of Jewish Jokes</em>, and a Kanye West impersonator.</p><p>When you know a specific group of people only celebrates one holiday and you know which one it is, it can be a Christmas Party. No need to be a PC-corporate douche.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
