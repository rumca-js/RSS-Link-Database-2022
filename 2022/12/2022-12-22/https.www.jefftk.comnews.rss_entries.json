[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Lead in Chocolate?", "description": "<p><span>\n\nConsumer Reports recently tested a bunch of dark chocolate for lead\nand cadmium, and found that:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nFor 23 of the bars, eating just an ounce a day would put an adult over\na level that public health authorities and CR's experts say may be\nharmful for at least one of those heavy metals. Five of the bars were\nabove those levels for both cadmium and lead.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIf you regularly eat chocolate, how worried about this should you be?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nConsumer Reports used <a href=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/general-info/current-proposition-65-no-significant-risk-levels-nsrls-maximum\">the\nlimits</a> from California's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_California_Proposition_65\">Prop\n65</a>, which you may recall from the \"this thing contains chemicals\nknown to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or\nother reproductive harm\" warnings that are all over everything in\nCA. For both lead and cadmium Consumer Reports used the reproductive harm \"maximum\nallowable daily level\" (MADL), which are 0.5 &#181;g/d and\n4.1&#181;g/d respectively.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nCA calculates these limits by looking at studies that try to find the\nhighest dose that has no observable effect (NOEL, \"No Observable\nEffect Level\") or the lowest dose that does have one (LOEL, \"Lowest\nObservable Effect Level\"), and estimating an effect threshold.  Then\nthey divide by 1,000 (as required by the <a href=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/proposition-65/general-info/prop65ballot1986.pdf\">original\nproposition text</a>) to get the MADL limit.  For example, here's the\nprocess they used for cadmium (<a href=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/cadmium20madl.pdf\">pdf</a>).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA safety factor of 1,000 is large (though not nuts for converting from\na single dose to an ongoing exposure), so it's not surprising that\nCA's limits are tighter than you see elsewhere.  For example, the\nFDA's limits for lead are 3&#181;g/d for kids and 12.5&#181;g/d for\nwomen who might become pregnant (<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/157949/download\">pdf</a>), 6x and 25x\nthe Prop 65 lead MADL.  The FDA translates this into a limit of 0.1\nppm for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-lead-candy-likely-be-consumed-frequently-small-children\">candy\nlikely to be consumed by small children</a>, 5.7x the level Consumer\nReports used.  [1]\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSimilarly, for cadmium the CDC <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/cadmium/Safety-Standards.html\">reports</a>\nthat the EPA limit (which I can't find on epa.gov) is for food is\n1&#181;g/kg/d.  CA used a pregnant adult weight of 58 kg in their\ncadmium calculation, so the equivalent from the EPA limit would be\n58&#181;g/d, 14x the CA Prop 65 level.  Using 25kg for a child\nweight would give 25&#181;g/d, 6.1x the Prop 65 cadmium MADL.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPutting these all on the same footing, assuming you're eating 1oz of\nchocolate daily:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<th>&#181;g/d</th>\n<th>ppm (&#181;g/g)\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CA Prop 65 lead MADL</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>0.018\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FDA kid lead limit</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0.1\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FDA pregnant adult lead limit</td>\n<td>12.5</td>\n<td>0.44\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chocolate-lead-levels-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chocolate-lead-levels.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nand:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<th>&#181;g/d</th>\n<th>ppm (&#181;g/g)\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CA Prop 65 cadmium MADL</td>\n<td>4.1</td>\n<td>0.15\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EPA child cadmium limit</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>0.88\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EPA adult cadmium limit</td>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>2.0\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chocolate-cadmium-levels-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chocolate-cadmium-levels.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n<br />\n\n<i>(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Ej4kVMImPpd4KSqt_bYbziE6k1WOsivNaw0kW87ti4/edit?usp=sharing\">sheet</a>)</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nMy overall interpretation is that while it's better to eat chocolate\nwith lower heavy metal content, all things being equal, these levels\nare basically fine and it's not worth avoiding chocolate over.\nThe Consumer Reports findings seem alarming only because dividing by\n1,000 in determining CA Prop 65 levels gives a super conservative\nsafety factor.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] Consumer Reports used a limit of 0.5&#181;g/oz, which is\n0.018&#181;g/g (the same as ppm).\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid031o3chQDwqd7jhQqqYVev6i6T4ryYNnsEUZ4CyxHvB9pPDq3EmWcXo4FMWtWBJFtCl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/DdJZ9MFK8xPLpxz6k\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109558199456666082\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/lead-in-chocolate", "date_published": "2022-12-22 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Non-Elevated Air Purifiers", "description": "<p><span>\n\nLast year for Christmas gatherings at my dad's house I put together </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/elevated-air-purifier-cubes\">wall-mounted filter cubes</a>,\nto get them up and out of the way.  This time around this seemed like\ntoo much hassle, so I put one together on top of the piano, one in a\nbookcase, and used one commercial purifier:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/filters-on-piano-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/filters-on-piano.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nIt's double-ended because I had an extra fan.  You do need to remember\nto turn on both fans.  Probably would be slightly more effective if\nI'd put a partition in the middle to make it actually be two\nindependent cubes.  I used the 12x20 filters from my <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/ceiling-air-purifier\">ceiling fan air purifier</a> project.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe kitchen has a commercial purifier, which has a similar capacity to\nthe filter cubes while taking less space.  If I wanted to run these\nall the time I might buy several commercial purifiers, but since these\nare just for occasional use that seems less worth it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/commercial-purifier-in-kitchen-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/commercial-purifier-in-kitchen.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFor the living room, <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">Julia</a> had\nthe clever idea of using a part of the built-in shelving that was\nexactly the right size:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bookcase-filter-cube-construction-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bookcase-filter-cube-construction.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bookcase-filter-cube-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bookcase-filter-cube.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is only two filters worth, but I still feel a lot of airflow from\nthe fans.  It's a good location for not being in the way, though we\ndid need to talk to the kids about leaving it alone since it would be\neasily damaged if bumped.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI should make some shrouds for the fans.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0HeNzPcJPEVwSu2A6Vn568eziURcoimREToc2v6rjLr28EHLb16gFxhxqF5pAsrxLl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/HAhMEvDNhudRm39Xg\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109568663475873856\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/non-elevated-air-purifiers", "date_published": "2022-12-22 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
