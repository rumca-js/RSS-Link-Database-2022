## LastPass got hacked again, and this time it affects customers

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> On December 22, LastPass published <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a new blog post</a> with further information about leaked customer information, saying that account information such as billing addresses, email addresses, end-user names, telephone numbers, and IP address info were obtained. Also leaked was customer vault data, which includes unencrypted data such as website URLs and encrypted data such as website usernames and passwords, secure notes, and form-filled data.</p><p>You can read more about the information lost in the company&rsquo;s blog post, as well as its full explanation of what&rsquo;s happened so far and the steps the company is taking next. If you&rsquo;re a LastPass customer, your best protection is to use a strong random password that&rsquo;s never been used elsewhere. You can also choose to switch providers&mdash;our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">round-up of the best password managers</a> has suggestions beyond LastPass that you can try.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>The original story from Dec 1, which covers more background details of the leak, follows below.</em></p>



<p>It&rsquo;s been a rough year for LastPass. Back in August, the popular password manager <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">suffered a security breach</a>, in which the company&rsquo;s developer environment was infiltrated. At the time, LastPass said that while part of its source code and proprietary technical info were taken, customers were unaffected.</p>



<p>Now the company has experienced a second related hack, this time impacting customers. As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/11/notice-of-recent-security-incident/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reported Wednesday on its blog</a>, LastPass recently detected unusual activity within a third-party cloud storage service. An investigation has so far revealed that the breach stemmed from knowledge gained during the August 2022 incident, and that &ldquo;certain elements of customers&rsquo; information&rdquo; have been accessed. Further information is unavailable, as the investigation is still ongoing. LastPass says that customer passwords remain safely encrypted, however.</p>



<p>If you find this news unsettling despite the service earning recommendations (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">including ours</a>) for its day-to-day experience, your reaction is a fair one. LastPass has suffered hacks of its service in previous years, with notable incidents including <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2015&rsquo;s unauthorized access</a> of user account email addresses, password reminders, and authentication hashes. Other security lapses include <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3183586/password-stealing-flaws-in-lastpass-chrome-and-firefox-extensions.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">2017&rsquo;s browser extension vulnerability</a>, which allowed websites to steal passwords. In 2019, the same security researcher who discovered the 2017 issue also discovered <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/09/16/google-warns-lastpass-users-were-exposed-to-last-password-credential-leak/?sh=4504ad524600&amp;xcust=2-1-917244-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">another browser extension vulnerability</a> that allowed the last used password to be leaked. The company has even made communication bumbles, like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-users-warned-their-master-passwords-are-compromised/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">security alert emails</a> sent to customers unaffected by a credential stuffing attack.</p>



<p>Other top-notch password managers haven&rsquo;t reported nearly as many incidents over the years, and if you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can make a switch to one of them pretty easily. You can also review the security on your LastPass account, making sure it falls in line with best practices, including the use of a strong password, enabling two factor authentication, and keeping a close eye on authorized devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as discomforting as this transparency may be, the underlying issue isn&rsquo;t the general concept of a password manager. They remain a vital part of online security, and you can find ways of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">making them more comfortable</a> to use, even in the face of security breaches. Don&rsquo;t abandon them outright.</p>

<p>The $160 ($110 on sale via a coupon on Amazon at the time of this writing) DDPai Mini5, is one of the more elegant front dash cams I&rsquo;ve experienced. It&rsquo;s of the display-less (and largely buttonless) variety, but with the phone connectivity, most users will barely miss it or the buttons. It also opts for internal memory and computer connectivity over TF cards.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html">best dash cams</a>. Go there to learn about competing products, what to look for in a dash cam, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="ddpai-mini5-design-and-features">DDPai Mini5: Design and features</h2>



<p>The Mini5 is a flattened cylinder approximately 4.15-inches long, 1.45-inches deep, and a hair less than an inch thick. The 140 degree field-of-view, 4K UHD camera is by far the most prominent feature on the main body. The only other notable physical features are an emergency save button on the left and a Type-C port on the right, plus an activity light on the back (green means active).</p>



<p>The mount is a self-adhesive (semi-permanent) cage that the camera itself slides into. You attach the Type-A-to-Type-C USB power cable (an aux adapter is included) after the camera is in place and it helps keep the camera from slipping out. Not that that is a likely scenario&mdash;the fit is very snug. The Mini5 and mount both have a substantial feel. Many dash cams feel cheap; this one doesn&rsquo;t.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1433121" height="520" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddpai-wifi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="800" /><figcaption>The  DDPai Mini5 will use 5GHz Wi-Fi if it&rsquo;s available for faster transfers.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As mentioned, the Mini5 features integrated eMMC memory&mdash;64GB of it, to be exact. That&rsquo;s a fair amount; however, the math might be considered a tad concerning. With the video captures taking approximately 234MB per minute at 3840&times;2160 (222MB for a full-res file, and 12MB for a smaller file used for display, etc.) you&rsquo;ll write the full capacity of the card in less than five hours.</p>



<p>DDPai describes the eMMC as having 3,000 write cycles, so you&rsquo;ll likely get around 15,000 hours out of the Mini5. That&rsquo;s quite a lot for most users, even ride givers. But there are also ways to cut down drastically on the disk space used: employing h.265 (100MB per minute at 4K UHD ) rather than the default h.264 if your devices support it, and knocking down the resolution to 1600p (50-60MBpm using h.265), or 1080p (25MBpm using h.265). </p>



<p>Good optics and processing can make up for a lot of the missing detail from 4K UHD, but try the three resolutions and see which you like best. Normally, I step up to 4K UHD only when the scenery warrants it. That said, I&rsquo;m unlikely to ever approach 15,000 hours of dash cam use so I might just set it to max and forget it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1433118" height="839" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DDPai-Mini5-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The DDPai app is your gateway to the Mini5&rsquo;s settings, which are copious. Foundry facilities manager Luis Ibarra is the man in live view. Thanks Luis.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Mini5&rsquo;s Spartan design is because all settings are tweaked using the DDPai app. The app features an installation guide and alignment grid on the home page&rsquo;s live view. You connect via Wi-Fi (faster 5GHz when possible), so there&rsquo;s only your phone service internet while using the app. Various parameters include g-sensor tweaking, how to handle GPS info, volume, audio capture, etc. All the normal goodies.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s of course a parking mode, but it requires that the camera have constant power. This means a hard-wire kit or OBDII power cable. Note that it is possible to run your battery down with such a setup, though most cameras will ditch the parking mode if an under-voltage state occurs.</p>



<p>The app also will display a map of your travels, but only after you download videos to your phone. The aforementioned smaller files are used for preview directly from the camera. On a rather random note, I will say that hearing &ldquo;Hello Ding Ding Pai&rdquo; every time the camera powers up makes me smile.</p>



<p>So does the two-year warranty, which is twice the length of most. Note that some cheaper dash cams are only warrantied for 90 days. I can&rsquo;t vouch for DDPai&rsquo;s customer service, but the company&rsquo;s PR were dogged in their communications with me.</p>



<h2 id="ddpai-mini5-performance">DDPai Mini5: Performance</h2>



<p>Though I found the Mini5&rsquo;s daylight video a tad overexposed, the effect was minimal and can be dialed back in the settings. Some of the indistinct mottling you see below is my windshield and due to inclement conditions the night before. Most cameras filter this out. However, all in all, day captures are colorful and reveal plenty of detail. That integrated GPS allows you to pinpoint locations and track your travels. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1427372" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DDPai-Mini5-day-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Though the surrounding areas are a bit over exposed, the focal point is not. This is a very good, detailed capture. The smudges are on my windshield and not artifacts from the camera.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Night video was generally quite good, though I did notice one instance of flare blowout that you can see in the second capture. This must&rsquo;ve been a freak angle and even cars driving closely by didn&rsquo;t cause this phenomenon.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1427373" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DDPai-Mini5-night-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This  night capture from the Mini5 is excellent. It shows a lot more detail when you brighten it up in post.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Below is the artifact I told you about. As noted, this was the exception and generally flare is not an issue. Note that you can still see good detail in the surrounding areas. And yes, 0km/h means I was parked. There&rsquo;s a setting to change this to MPH for the U.S. market. I didn&rsquo;t notice it immediately as dash cams sold here are normally set to MPH.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1427375" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DDPai-Mini5-night-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I&rsquo;m not sure what caused this headlight flare as it was the only real instance. Most headlights didn&rsquo;t result in this blowout.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I should note that the Mini5 ran very cool. The unit employs a super capacitor which allows the camera to run long enough to save any current video, but not to capture post-incident action should the car power fail.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-ddpai-mini5">Should you buy the DDPai Mini5?</h2>



<p>Other than the integrated memory wearing out in the far future (like Apple&rsquo;s planned obsolescence with SSDs), there&rsquo;s nothing about the Mini5 not to like. It&rsquo;s lush, exceptionally easy to set up and use, and the captures are very good. If you desire the premium experience provided by the DDPai Mini5, go for it.</p>

<p>My jaw fell to the floor when I came across this laptop deal this morning. Ebay&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/304607937740&amp;xcust=2-1-1442359-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Gigabyte Aero for $1,099.99</a>, which is a whopping $1,449.01 off. The silver finish on the exterior gives it a clean, modern look. The 4K AMOLED display is to die for as well. Underneath the hood, however, it&rsquo;s packing some serious heat&mdash;including an RTX 3070 Ti that&rsquo;s not full <em>two tiers</em> more powerful than the RTX 3060 laptops you normally find in this price range.</p>



<p>The Gigabyte Aero features an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, a ferocious Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a massive amount of power, so you should be able to play most games on high or ultra graphics. The Aero would make a solid content creation laptop as well, given the powerful specs. The 16-inch AMOLED display has a resolution of 3840&times;2400, which is mega impressive. The screen should produce images that are bright, colorful, and crisp.</p>

In short: The best ultrawide gaming monitor money can buy is even better than before.</p>
</div>


<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DW</a>, the world&rsquo;s first ultrawide OLED gaming monitor, demolished its competition when it arrived in early 2022 at an MSRP of just $1,299. Though still expensive, it undercut competing OLED and Mini-LED monitors by hundreds of dollars. Yet Alienware apparently was satisfied with that, and has launched an even less expensive follow-up: the AW3423DWF. It has most of the features of its predecessors but lowers the price to $1,099.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">the best monitors</a>. Go there to learn about competing products, what to look for in a monitor, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-the-specs">Alienware AW3423DWF: The specs</h2>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is extremely similar to its predecessor, the AW3423DW, which is still sold today. So, what&rsquo;s the difference? It all comes down to adaptive sync.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 34-inch ultrawide</li><li>Native resolution: 3,440 x 1,440</li><li>Panel type: QD-OLED</li><li>Refresh rate: 165Hz</li><li>HDR: Yes</li><li>Ports: 1x HDMI 2.0, 2x DisplayPort 1.4, 5x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1x Audio &amp; Headphone out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Yes</li><li>VESA mount: Yes</li><li>Speakers: No</li><li>Price: $1,099</li></ul>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA Adapative Sync, while the prior AW3423DW only supports Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate. Connectivity also differs: The new AW3423DWF has one HDMI 2.0 and two DisplayPort 1.4, while the older AW3423DW has two HDMI 2.0 and one DisplayPort 1.4. Finally, the AW3423DWF has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz, while the prior AW3423DW has a slightly higher maximum refresh rate of 175Hz.</p>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-design">Alienware AW3423DWF: Design</h2>



<p>Alienware hasn&rsquo;t changed, updated, or improved the design of the AW3423DWF over its predecessor aside from one noticeable exception: This model is only available in black, while the older model is only available in white. The black colorway looks less premium than white, mostly because it lacks the two-tone motif of the white model, which uses both white and black panels to contrast elements of the design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s merely a difference of style: The new monitor seems just as well-built and sturdy as the prior model, which is good news. This is a hefty beast for its size, with thick plastic panels and a large stand. It&rsquo;s among the most robust and attractive monitors available today.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440695" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is only available in Black, but it has an excellent robust design.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The stand adjusts for height, tilt, and swivel, and pivots a few degrees in either direction. It&rsquo;s also heavy enough to keep the monitor planted and dampen movement should you accidentally bump your desk. However, it retains a problem found with its predecessor: The stand is too large and deep, so the display sits a bit closer than expected. Alternatively, the monitor has a standard 100x100mm VESA mount for attaching a third-party monitor stand or arm.</p>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-features-and-menus">Alienware AW3423DWF: Features and menus</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440698" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Alienware AW3423DWF improves upon its predecessor&rsquo;s port selection with more DisplayPort inputs.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connections and one HDMI 2.0 on the AW3423DWF&rsquo;s rear. This is an improvement over the earlier, more expensive AW3423DW. Why? HDMI 2.0 can only handle a refresh rate of 100Hz at the monitor&rsquo;s native resolution. Swapping an HDMI to DisplayPort opens the option to add a second PC input at the full 165Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monitor has a total of four USB-A ports, two of which are on the monitor&rsquo;s front lip for easy access. They&rsquo;re driven by a USB-B upstream port. USB-C remains absent from the monitor. That&rsquo;s a forgivable problem for a gaming monitor, but at least one USB-C input would be preferred.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440699" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The well-designed Alienware AW3423DWF menu system.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Alienware&rsquo;s menu system relies on a joystick crouching behind the center of the bottom bezel. It&rsquo;s easy to access and responds quickly to input. The menus are well labeled and sorted, too, making them easy to navigate.</p>



<p>The monitor offers a healthy range of image-quality adjustments including sRGB and DCI-P3 modes, several color temperature and gamma adjustments, and RGB color adjustments for hue, gain, and saturation. There are a few annoyances: for example, the color temperature modes don&rsquo;t seem accessible with other calibration options. Still, these options should help creators adjust the monitor to their needs, which is good news if you want to use the monitor for professional photo editing, video editing, or graphics design.</p>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-sdr-image-quality">Alienware AW3423DWF: SDR image quality</h2>



<p>The previous Alienware AW3423DW&rsquo;s image quality was excellent, landing it at the top of our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">the best gaming monitors</a>. The AW3423DWF lives up to the standard it set. It has the same QD-OLED panel and delivered identical performance in testing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440700" height="824" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF&rsquo;s SDR brightness comes in at 250 nits, a smidge higher than the 246 nits of the prior model. This is a healthy level of SDR brightness for an OLED monitor. It&rsquo;s higher than typical of 42-inch and 48-inch widescreen displays, like the Acer Predator CG48, and ties the Corsair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240. That&rsquo;s an important point, as the Corsair monitor uses the LG panel that will be found in a variety of 27-inch 1440p OLED monitors through 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 250 nits isn&rsquo;t bright when compared to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html">Asus ProArt PA348CGV</a>, our favorite ultrawide monitor without OLED or Mini-LED technology. The Alienware also has a glossy display coat that amplifies reflections. A bright light source, like a sunlit window or 60-watt equivalent LED bulb, can make viewing uncomfortable. OLED remains best for dark rooms with good light control.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440703" height="831" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The contrast ratio knocks it out of the park with an effectively infinite ratio. The exact contrast ratio an OLED panel boasts can vary (Alienware claims 1,000,000:1), but this number is not a useful guide. In practice, all of the OLED monitors in the graph above achieve a visually perfect black level in a dark room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Asus ProArt PA348CGV, which has an edge-lit LED backlight with only a few dimming zones, achieved a much lower maximum contrast ratio of 1120:1. That&rsquo;s pretty good for a monitor in its price bracket, but the difference between it and the Alienware AW3423DWF is obvious. The Asus ProArt looks hazy and foggy in dark scenes, which saps drama from dimly lit movies, like <em>The Batman</em>, and darker games, like <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em> or <em>Resident Evil Village</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440705" height="828" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color gamut is a perk, as the Alienware AW3423DWF achieves over 100 percent of sRGB, 99 percent of DCI-P3, and 95 percent of AdobeRGB. Higher is better in this test, and the Alienware hits the highest marks among similarly priced monitors. These results are remarkable given its competition: All of the monitors in the graph above are top-notch performers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In everyday use, gaming, and movies, this leads to an oversaturated and vibrant image that looks superb in most situations and stands out in bright, colorful content like <em>Overwatch 2</em> or Pixar&rsquo;s <em>Rio</em>. The wide gamut is also suitable for virtually all content creation: Those who want better performance will need a high-end professional monitor like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">$3,500 Asus ProArt PA32DC OLED</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440707" height="884" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy is excellent, as well. It technically scores as less color accurate than the prior AW3423DW, but differences of this amount are not generally noticeable. In fact, all of the monitors on the graph above are accurate enough that they could be used for a wide variety of professional workflows, and all look realistic in daily use and entertainment.</p>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF did well in gamma and color temperature testing. It presented the preferred gamma curve of 2.2, which means content looks about as bright as expected, and hit a color temperature of 6200K, which is slightly warm but not too far off the target of 6500K. The result is a pleasant, inviting image. As mentioned, the monitor offers several gamma preset modes and color temperature modes, so some calibration is possible for those who prefer different settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the AW3423DWF has excellent image quality overall, it suffers a problem found in its predecessor: mediocre sharpness. The monitor&rsquo;s resolution of 3440&times;1440 works out to about 110 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s nearly the same as a 27-inch 1440p widescreen but way below a 27-inch 4K monitor, which packs roughly 163 pixels per inch.</p>



<p>The QD-OLED panel also has an uncommon triangular RGB subpixel layout. Windows does not expect this layout and, as a result, there&rsquo;s some fringing and pixelation around small fonts and interface elements. It&rsquo;s not a dealbreaker, but it can make fonts less attractive and more difficult to read. The problem is much less obvious in games, which tend to have larger fonts. That said, the Alienware AW3423DWF looks brilliant&mdash;in fact, I subjectively like it more than I did when I reviewed its predecessor, the AW3423DW. I&rsquo;ve had the chance to test a lot of competitors to Alienware&rsquo;s OLED in the past year and found that while most are excellent, none of them beat the Alienware&rsquo;s QD-OLED panel overall (except for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus ProArt PA32DC</a>, but it&rsquo;s in another league entirely). On balance, the AW3423DW and AW3423DWF have the best SDR image of any OLED monitor available for $2,000 or less.</p>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-hdr-image-quality">Alienware AW3423DWF: HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF also delivers an HDR experience that, while not perfect, is much better than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the bad news: This is an OLED display and, like most OLED panels found in monitors to date, it can&rsquo;t display extreme levels of brightness. I measured a maximum full-screen HDR brightness of 306 nits, and a maximum brightness of 453 nits when only 10 percent of the display was lit. LED and Mini-LED displays often achieve and sustain 500 to 600 nits full-screen. This puts the AW3423DWF at a disadvantage when displaying extremely bright scenes, like a snowy mountaintop. It never looks as pure and brilliant as an LED-lit rival.</p>



<p>However, OLED&rsquo;s contrast should not be forgotten. The monitor&rsquo;s ability to achieve a perfect black level makes the brightness it can deliver appear remarkable in dark scenes. The neon signs of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> seem to leap out of the display, while the starry skies of <em>Interstellar</em> are presented with tack-sharp accuracy. The Alienware AW3423DWF is perfect for dark, moody, high-contrast content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AW3423DWF also drastically improves on the brightness stability of its predecessor. My testing of the older AW3423DW revealed noticeable swings in the monitor&rsquo;s brightness when transitioning between bright and dark scenes, or when moving bright windows across a dark background. It was a major distraction in day-to-day use. Alienware seems to have conquered these issues with firmware updates (and a quick browse through Dell&rsquo;s support forums indicates users have noticed this, as well).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also noticed the AW3423DWF has several HDR image presets that I don&rsquo;t recall seeing on the prior model, including a custom color mode with six-axis customization. This is an exceptionally rare and much appreciated feature for a mainstream HDR monitor. Most HDR monitors lock image customization when HDR mode is turned on.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m still not entirely satisfied with the HDR performance of the Alienware AW3423DWF, but most of its problems are shared with other price-competitive OLED monitors. Mini-LED monitors are often better for HDR, especially if HDR brightness is a priority for you. Still, the Alienware AW3423DWF is a good performer overall and absolutely demolishes older monitors with edge-lit LED backlights, and it fixes the prior model&rsquo;s flaws.</p>



<h2 id="alienware-aw3423dwf-motion-clarity">Alienware AW3423DWF: Motion clarity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware AW3423DWF" class="wp-image-1440708" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Overall performance is good on the Alienware AW3423DWF, even if the motion clarity is lacking a bit.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. This is a minor downgrade from the AW3423DW&rsquo;s maximum refresh rate of 175Hz, but the difference is insignificant. Motion performance is excellent in general, with great motion clarity that makes small details in fast-moving objects visible. The OLED panel&rsquo;s fast pixel response times preserve decent clarity even at lower refresh rates, so clarity is better than average even when the refresh rate is restricted to 60Hz.</p>



<p>Alienware is at a disadvantage compared to new 240Hz OLED monitors based on LG&rsquo;s latest panel, however. Examples include the Corsair Xeneon Flex and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1387567/lgs-new-oled-gaming-monitor-is-the-cheapest-yet.html">the LG Ultragear 27GR95QE-B</a>. These monitors provide better clarity in fine details. For example, character names in MOBA and MMORPG games are mostly readable when panning the camera on a 240Hz monitor, but not at 165Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the AW3423DWF&rsquo;s overall performance is great and should please a huge majority of gamers. It&rsquo;s also a good choice for graphically demanding titles that can&rsquo;t sustain a frame rate near 165Hz, nevermind 240Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AW3423DWF officially supports the AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA Adaptive Sync standards, and it can unofficially support G-Sync. The AW3423DW only supports Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate. This makes the new AW3423DWF more versatile, while the AW3423DW is better for Nvidia video cards. In practice, both look buttery-smooth in nearly all situations.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-alienware-aw3423dwf">Should you buy the Alienware AW3423DWF?</h2>



<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is a fantastic ultrawide monitor that successfully defends its throne against recent OLED and Mini-LED alternatives. It delivers the same excellent image quality as its predecessor, fixes several of its flaws, and sweetens the deal with a $200 price drop. Make no mistake: This is the ultrawide gaming monitor to buy.</p>

## I switched from a MacBook to a PC laptop: 5 big upsides, 1 big downside

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>After more than a decade of Mac-centric computing, I made a big switch last month, setting aside my MacBook Pro and moving to an Alienware Aurora R13 desktop as my primary day-to-day computer. While the proliferation of cloud-based services and cross-platform utilities has made switching easier than it&rsquo;s ever been, it&rsquo;s still a significant change to the way we live and work. Along the way, I hit a few snags and annoyances, but I also unlocked some awesome Windows capabilities that were out of reach on my Mac.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>Why the switch from Mac to PC?</strong></h2>



<p>In a world where the bulk of my daily interactions happen through a digital interface, switching computing platforms changed just about everything in some way. Reflexive menu navigation and hotkey patterns ingrained in muscle memory over many years suddenly meant nothing, and I would need to learn new ones in their place. So, given the hassle of disrupting daily life in ways ranging from subtle to significant, making the leap to Windows had <em>better </em>yield some worthwhile benefits. What I&rsquo;d hoped to gain in the process were:</p>



<ul><li>More options in computing technology and manufacturers</li><li>More flexibility in software ecosystems</li><li>More customization possibilities</li><li>More upgrade options for hardware and software</li><li>A lot more gaming options</li></ul>



<p>One month in, I have not been disappointed.</p>



<p>I should pause a moment to acknowledge that I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;Mac guy&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Windows guy.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been in tech since the web first became a thing, and I&rsquo;ve run everything from Unix and Linux to Windows and macOS. I was a Linux blogger for <em>Maximum PC</em>, an editor of <em>Windows Magazine</em>, and a contributor to <em>MacAddict </em>and <em>Macworld</em>. My company-issued work computers have been MacBook Pros for the past decade, and I&rsquo;ve consolidated much of my daily life onto Apple&rsquo;s messaging and media ecosystem more out of convenience than anything else.</p>



<p>So that&rsquo;s me. Now, here are the five big advantages I&rsquo;ve found in the switch to Windows.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MacBook Pro covered with stickers" class="wp-image-1440861" height="928" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/old_macbookpro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>This 15-inch MacBook Pro has served me well for several years, but it&rsquo;s time to hand it down to the kids</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>The PC has more hardware options</strong></h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s no getting around it: The PC ecosystem is just massively vast. While the Mac range offers a healthy variety of form factors and performance levels, it doesn&rsquo;t even come close to the breadth of PC systems available for purchase off the shelf. And if you&rsquo;re into desktops and don&rsquo;t like what you see in the mind-bogglingly vast range of prebuilt machines, you can hand-select every single component yourself and build something custom from the chassis up.</p>



<p>Since Apple moved its Mac lines to the company&rsquo;s own CPUs, buying a MacBook means selecting an <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/676321/m1-pro-max-ultra-guide.html">M1 chip</a> or an M2. That&rsquo;s it, unless you want a Mac Mini with an Intel Core i5 or i7, or a $6,000 Mac Pro with a Xeon. </p>



<p>By contrast, the mainstream Windows PC range presents an abundance of CPU choices. Intel Core i3, i5, i7, and i9 CPU lines each offer multiple options, as does the copious AMD Ryzen family. If you&rsquo;re not easily thwarted by decision-paralysis, the Windows world gives you a lot more room to customize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More hardware choices also means more pricing options. The lowest end MacBook, the 2020 <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1435426/this-crazy-999-m2-macbook-air-deal-is-a-christmas-miracle.html">MacBook Air, runs $999</a>. A comparably spec&rsquo;d Windows laptop can be had for $350. It won&rsquo;t be Apples to &ldquo;apples,&rdquo; of course, because Mac hardware is proprietary, but the performance will be similar. Meanwhile, high-end PCs offer incredible specs in a vast array of form factors for every specialized need, from gaming to intense Intel Xeon-powered graphics workstations. At pretty much every price point, you get more hardware for the dollar with a PC than with a Mac.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware X15 laptop on desk." class="wp-image-1440865" height="1022" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alienware_x15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>I selected this Alienware x15 as the drop-in replacement for my Macbook Pro for mobile use.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<p>In my case, I went for two different PCs, both from Alienware. My daily-use desktop is the Alienware Aurora R13 with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560524/intel-launches-12th-gen-mobile-core-as-best-mobile-gaming-platform.html">12th Gen Intel</a> Core i7 3.61GHz CPU and an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393473/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-3440x1440-ultrawide-benchmarks.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU</a>. For mobility, I chose an Alienware x15 R1 with a Core i7 and an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393668/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-3440x1440-ultrawide-benchmarks.html">RTX 3070</a>. What can I say? I&rsquo;ve always liked the peculiar styling of Alienware machines, and these had the specs I wanted in designs I dig. These are seriously capable systems, but not extravagantly high-end, and yet they both cost about as much as a <em>midrange </em>MacBook Pro.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>The PC has a bigger, more flexible software ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>Because Windows constitutes roughly 76 percent of the global computing market share, and developers around the world who&rsquo;ve never even seen a Mac in person are cranking out apps constantly, the numbers game here is obvious. I don&rsquo;t want to overblow this, because most of the really major productivity suites out there work on both platforms just fine. But if you want seemingly unlimited options for software in just about every category, Windows wins hands-down.</p>



<p>For me, this was much less of an issue with mainstream apps than with niche apps. Niche interests, like amateur radio and astronomy, for example, tend to be dominated by Windows-only apps built by independent developers. So, before switching to Windows as my daily driver, I generally had to either run a virtual machine on my Mac, connect to a Raspberry Pi box running the apps I needed, or keep a cheap, spare Windows laptop around for occasional use. But since switching to a PC full-time, those headaches have disappeared. (And I haven&rsquo;t once needed to get my old MacBook to run anything.)</p>



<p>Switching from Apple&rsquo;s built-in apps was a mixed experience. It used to be that if you had all your pictures in iPhoto, it was difficult to move all that stuff to Windows. In years past, I had seen significant degradation of my photo library on importing it into Windows. But Apple has made it surprisingly easy to pull your iCloud photos into Windows, edit them in Windows Photos, and even see the changes back in your iCloud library on a Mac.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Adobe Creative Suite on Windows" class="wp-image-1440891" height="723" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Adobe-Creative-Suite.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>One of the most commonly-touted advantages of the Mac ecosystem is its support for creative apps, but I&rsquo;ve found Adobe Creative Suite and similar apps run great on Windows.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<p>For other media tasks, I found that Apple&rsquo;s most challenging built-in app to replace is GarageBand, which is wildly better than any free equivalent I&rsquo;ve found for Windows. Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">ClipChamp</a>, however, is now a pretty solid replacement for iMovie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there is no Windows equivalent for iMessage when it comes to connecting your iPhone to the PC, Windows supports connectivity to any Android phone, giving you way more flexibility in what brands of devices you can use with your PC. I&rsquo;ll discuss more about dealing with Apple&rsquo;s isolated ecosystem of apps and devices later in this article.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>3. The PC offers better customization</strong></h2>



<p>It feels weird to call Windows an &ldquo;open&rdquo; operating system, but compared to macOS, Windows is a big ol&rsquo; open playground of customization possibilities, both for hardware and software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Windows OS is also generally more customizable than macOS, although a great many utilities exist for both platforms. That said, Apple has a clear bias against encouraging users to tweak the look and feel of their OS, while Microsoft has long fostered a community of theme developers to help users personalize Windows to their tastes.</p>



<p>Apple&rsquo;s system-on-a-chip approach to hardware, tightly integrated with macOS, has its own advantages: Apple has focused on building a unified hardware/software product that works incredibly well and yields great performance. Comparing that performance to a Windows PC is tricky, because the CPU and GPU benchmarks we use at PCWorld won&rsquo;t run on a Mac. But the PCs&rsquo; big performance advantage across the board is the ability to tweak hardware performance. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overlocking software interface" class="wp-image-1440867" height="636" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/overclocking-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Even off-the-shelf PCs include tools for overclocking and tweaking your hardware performance.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<p>A knowledgeable PC user can overclock CPUs and GPUs, shut down system processes, and tweak every element of the software and hardware to optimize performance. Most gaming PCs come preloaded with performance management software just for this purpose, making it easy even for relative novices to overclock.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>4. The PC is packed with upgrade potential</strong></h2>



<p>The range of hardware upgrade options for Windows PCs is at least as vast as the array of off-the-shelf PCs available for sale. CPUs, GPUs, RAM, storage drives, USB controllers, capture cards, just about anything that can be put inside a computer is available as a fairly easy upgrade for a desktop PC.</p>



<p>While laptops are generally proprietary and much more difficult to to upgrade beyond swapping out RAM and storage, a few allow for CPU and GPU module upgrades that can be done by anyone with a screwdriver. One particularly interesting option: The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/835070/replacing-the-frameworks-cpu-made-me-a-believer-in-upgradeable-laptops.html">Framework is designed for DIYers and tinkerers</a>, letting you build your own laptop and customize it to your desires.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Inside of Alienware R13 desktop" class="wp-image-1440872" height="824" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alienware_r13-internal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>When the time comes, my Alienware desktop machine will be ready for easy GPU upgrades. The case pops open in seconds, and all components are within easy reach.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;ve upgraded Mac hardware from time to time, of course: Older MacBooks used to be fairly easy to open up and add/replace RAM and storage. Newer models, however, are built as system-on-a-chip, and while upgrade modules exist from some third parties, they&rsquo;re extremely expensive relative to PC upgrades, and basically amount to replacing all of the internal logic components at once. </p>



<p>In practice, it makes more sense just to buy a new Mac than to upgrade the components in an M1 or M2 machine. And because someone will bring it up: Yes, the $6,000+ Mac Pro is much more upgradeable, of course, but it&rsquo;s in a totally different class of machine than anything even enthusiast Mac or Windows users are likely to buy. We&rsquo;re really not talking about workstations here.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>5. The PC is a true gaming machine</strong></h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re at all interested in gaming, there&rsquo;s no denying Windows is the platform with the most choices. The biggest game studios develop for Windows first, then consoles or mobile. The biggest gaming titles tend not to be available for Mac at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wanna play <em>Call of Duty: Warzone II</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7</em>, or just about any of the top 20 games of 2022? You can get all of them on Windows, most of them on Xbox or Playstation, and even the Nintendo Switch has quite a few. A couple run on Macs, but you&rsquo;ll run out of options fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can certainly try running an emulator or virtual machine on your Mac, and there are ways to stream your games from a PC, but these are all kludges and hacks, and yield poor results. If gaming is your thing, Windows is a must.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware r13 gaming desktop on desk" class="wp-image-1440878" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alienware_r13-desktop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Come on, look at it. The Alienware is all gaming machine, and the Mac doesn&rsquo;t come close.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>One big downside: Messaging</strong></h2>



<p>The biggest hassle I encountered switching from Mac to PC was untangling my text messaging from Apple Messages&rsquo; walled garden. At least for now, I have no interest in trading in my iPhone for an Android phone. If I did, of course, I&rsquo;d be up and texting happily via Windows Phone Link, and could make calls from a connected phone as well, more or less the same way I could between my iPhone and my Mac. Sadly, no such connection exists between Apple Messages and Windows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, a workaround to enable texting and calls between the iPhone and Windows, and that&rsquo;s to switch over to a third-party SMS/calling app that works across platforms. The caveat, though, is that while these apps can send messages to and from your iPhone, they all get their own phone number. Some, like Google Voice, make it fairly easy to deal with this forwarding process, but none are as seamless as just having your native mobile number directly linked across devices. For that experience, a full switch to Windows means switching out your phone, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows Phone Link screen" class="wp-image-1440885" height="732" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/phone-link.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Windows Phone Link makes it easy to connect Android phones and get calls and texts right on your PC, but alas, it doesn&rsquo;t support iPhones at all.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Robert Strohmeyer/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The best way to avoid this trap would be to avoid getting locked into a proprietary messaging platform in the first place. But, time machines still being a major engineering challenge, my best option may be to migrate my text messaging to Google Voice, and use forwarding to bridge the gap. I&rsquo;d like to hope Apple will offer Messages on Windows the same way it has enabled the rest of iCloud. After all, Photos, Passwords, Contacts, and even iCloud Drive sync just fine. Pending that, though, I may be in the market for a new phone soon.</p>



<h2 class="toc"><strong>Don&rsquo;t fear the switch!</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s never been easier to switch back and forth between PCs and Macs. Having almost all our work and personal data in the cloud means you can be up and running on a new platform in minutes, and all your photos, files, and data will make their way onto the new machine within a few hours after that. So if you&rsquo;re contemplating a switch, the biggest hurdle you might encounter is selecting a new computer to buy, and there are plenty of guides to help with that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some folks may worry about learning a new user interface, my experience is that macOS and Windows have become similar enough over time that everything from searching the drive to installing apps from an app store to managing multiple desktops has achieved fairly consistent workflow parity between the two systems. I did find that I&rsquo;d lost the muscle memory for Windows hotkeys and had to spend some time googling the ones I wanted to use. This comes with time, though, and it&rsquo;s only a problem if you&rsquo;re a power user in the previous OS.</p>



<p>By contrast, switching mobile platforms remains a far bigger hassle. Apple and Google remain locked in a battle for dominance, and Apple in particular seems to constantly sabotage switchers with pointless limitations and lock-ins to discourage users from straying to competing platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For my money, the Windows world continues to offer the greatest breadth of options in both hardware and software, and the look and feel of the OS has advanced nicely in the past decade. So while the leap has not been completely annoyance-free, the benefits certainly outweigh the problems.</p>
