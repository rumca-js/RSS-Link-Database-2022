It was a salutary lesson, perhaps a life-forming one. “I’ve always been very mindful about how I manage my money based on what I want to achieve,” she says, “and when James [her husband] and I decided we wanted to start a family, we talked a lot about how we were going to manage the money aspect of it.”</p><p>Hill later went into the world of finance and, now a consultant for her own firm, Wise Sherpa, she is determined that her daughter, Maddie, learns about the value of money and the importance of saving from a young age. “Money isn’t the most important thing in life, but how you manage money does matter,” she says.</p><p>Rebecca Hill and husband James Hasler are focused on teaching Maddie financial literacy by allowing her to control her own money</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/financial-literacy-for-all-the-family/2022/dec/22/how-having-a-debit-card-and-banking-app-taught-a-12-year-old-financial-literacy">Continue reading...</a>
