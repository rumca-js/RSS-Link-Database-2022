Bartees Strange came to the Twin Cities in November to play a sold-out show at the Turf Club in St. Paul. While in town, Bartees and two of his bandmates — Dan Kleederman and Graham Richman — visited The Current studio to play stripped-down versions of songs from Bartees Strange's 2022 album, "Farm To Table." Watch their performance of "Escape This Circus" above.

When deciding what to name their band, the term for the residual heat left on a chair after an individual has vacated it seemed the perfect fit: Manheat. Hailing from Duluth, Minnesota, Manheat display their hard-rock sensibilities by playing loud and fast.

Manheat stopped by The Local Show in support of their appearance at the Duluth Homegrown Festival, running May 1 to 8, 2011. @duluthhomegrown
