## Sure, moaning about ‘nepo babies’ is fun – but we're missing the bigger problem | Rebecca Shaw

<p>So much of the media we consume comes from people who have no idea what it’s like to be working class. We’re missing out</p><p>If you’ve been on Twitter lately (and huge congrats if you haven’t), you would have seen a lot of discussion about “nepo babies”. No, a nepo baby is not the strange cousin of a Cabbage Patch Doll nor a cool slang name for “nephews”. Rather it’s a term used to describe the children of celebrities who follow in their famous parents’ footsteps. Classic nepotism, you’ve heard of it. </p><p>The nepo baby spectrum also covers those who get a leg-up from family industry connections, or the children of the very rich, all of whom have doors opened for them from the time they arrive through their very first door (the vagina). There have always been nepo babies and there will always be nepo babies but that doesn’t mean it’s not frustrating. For example, while watching the new season of Amy Schumer’s sketch show last week, I noticed that one of the writers is Jerry Seinfeld’s 21-year-old daughter. As a sketch writer myself, I found this a bit annoying! But all the focus on nepo babies and famous people is obfuscating a more important and insidious problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/23/sure-moaning-about-nepo-babies-is-fun-but-were-missing-the-bigger-problem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pay-off of this gloriously twisted gameshow has such high stress, hellish back-stabs and helicopter dives that everyone ends up crying … even Claudia Winkleman</p><p>As the old saying goes: keep your friends close and your enemies closer. It’s an idiom that perfectly sums up the finale of The Traitors, the nail-bitingly tense reality gameshow that has, if you’re anything like me, dominated every conversation and group chat for the past four weeks.</p><p>Following 12 gloriously twisted episodes – and an extended insight into Claudia Winkleman’s collection of tweed jackets and oversized knitwear – the 22 contestants have been slimmed down until only five remain. Over that time, some of the Faithful have fallen victim to the murderous Traitors, who have whittled down the number with surprising ease (looking at you Amanda), while others were banished by the group via the psychologically torturous roundtable eliminations. There’s been back-stabbing (mainly from Wilf), wild revelations (Alex and Tom’s relationship drama), savagery and paranoia, and enough tears to power a waterworks. Honestly, just thinking about it all makes me want to lie down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/22/the-traitors-finale-review-so-thrilling-your-heart-wont-stop-hammering-in-your-chest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It your children have a new Xbox, Playstation or Nintendo Switch waiting under the tree, here is what you need to know about subscriptions, parental controls … and getting the most fun out of it for all the family</p><p>The days of game consoles being ready for action as soon as they’re plugged in are long gone, I’m afraid. Whether you’ve gone for an Xbox, PlayStation or Switch, your machine will need time to download the latest firmware updates before you can play <em>anything</em>. Depending on your broadband connection this can take anything from one to eight hours, so if you’re a parent, you may want to think about how you’re going to keep everyone entertained until that’s done. If it’s not already beautifully wrapped, it may even be worth sneakily unpacking the console and doing this prep-work before Christmas morning. If you have a spare ethernet cable (or can nick one from your PC for a day), consider setting up your console with a wired connection to your router rather than over wifi – this usually gives you a faster, more reliable connection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/22/a-parents-guide-to-setting-up-a-new-games-console-at-christmas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From The White Lotus to Wednesday, it felt like this year’s biggest shows all had the same goal in mind: be meme-d to hell and back</p><p>When watching season two of The White Lotus, you could predict the memes before each episode even finished. Take your pick: Aubrey Plaza drily declaring “I don’t watch Ted Lasso”; Italian characters saying “Let’s fun!” and “I’ll slay!”; the increasingly ludicrous outfits of spiritually and sartorially lost assistant Portia; and, above all, practically anything said by her boss, the incredibly insecure multimillionaire Tanya, played by gay icon (code for underappreciated character actor) Jennifer Coolidge.</p><p>Tanya’s silly-sinister plot was particularly ripe for memes – she was swept away by a sinister gay cabal who shower her with attention. “Gay guys really are the best,” she tells Portia mid-season, a meta-wink to the bulk of Coolidge’s real-life fans. By the finale she had announced: “These gays, they’re trying to murder me!” The meme potential of either is strong, but together? At least on my very gay social media feeds, it was unstoppable. But as with many moments in this year’s biggest television shows, this reaction felt like it had been deliberately driven by calculating minds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/dec/22/bye-bye-water-cooler-moments-this-year-television-was-all-about-memes-and-i-hate-love-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Do you want to know more about the huge hat he wears, the secret to that perfect skin or what it’s like working with Snoop Dogg? Get your questions in for the rapper and producer extraordinaire</p><p>For more than 25 years, Pharrell Williams has been one of the most impactful, influential and celebrated musicians in the world. As a rapper, singer and, most importantly, producer – solo and as one half of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/neptunes">the Neptunes</a> with his childhood friend Chad Hugo – Williams has minted dozens of hits, won a boatload of Grammys and reshaped the musical ethos of entire generations.</p><p>Known for his percussive, futuristic rap and R&amp;B beats, Williams first broke out in the late 90s, working on music with Hugo for artists on pop’s vanguard such as Clipse, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Kelis. Throughout the early 00s, he maintained a tight grip on the pop firmament, producing some of the era’s most indelible hits, including Britney Spears’ I’m a Slave 4 U, Kelis’ Milkshake, Gwen Stefani’s Hollaback Girl and, of course, Snoop Dogg’s Drop It Like It’s Hot, which Williams also rapped on. At the same time, he released records with Hugo as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/nerd">NERD</a> – an acronym for No One Ever Really Dies – and as a solo artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/22/post-your-questions-for-pharrell-williams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tourists’ ineptitude with the bat is in stark contrast to the potency of their bowling although the MCG pitch could help reduce the disparity</p><p>Everywhere you look there is decay. Things that once worked no longer do as they should. Rare success stories are inflated beyond their merit. Failures are greeted with accepting shrugs. Short term fixes are in short supply. Twist a narrative enough times and any international sports team will neatly embody the country it represents. That is not necessary when analysing the Proteas and their struggles with the bat. If anything, the comparisons with South Africa are a little too on the nose.</p><p>For the daily electrical blackouts see routine batting collapses. For the failed promises of the ruling African National Congress there is the unfulfilled potential of Aiden Markram. Squint your eyes at the crumbling public transport system and you might see Temba Bavuma’s single Test hundred from 89 innings. For the empty space on the team’s shirt where a sponsor should be, well, fill in the blank as you see fit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/23/south-african-imbalance-in-spotlight-with-dramatic-batting-improvement-needed">Continue reading...</a>

## Sixty years on from the Cuban missile crisis, the US has learned its lessons – but Putin has not | Vladislav Zubok

<p>Some in the Russian president’s entourage are searching for a way out of the Ukraine conflict. They should look to the history books</p><p>So many great crises of the past are reduced to anniversaries: they emerge for one day into the spotlight of media attention and then vanish for another year or another decade. This year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/cuban-missile-crisis-60-years-on-new-papers-reveal-how-close-the-world-came-to-nuclear-disaster">anniversary</a> of the Cuban missile crisis, however, feels different. Suddenly the past is catching up with us. In September, Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden">said</a> that in the case of “a threat to territorial integrity of our country, in order to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly use all means at our disposal. This is not a bluff.” This sinister talk was interpreted by many as an indication that the Russian leader might use nuclear weapons to prevent his defeat and humiliation in Ukraine. Thus, the drama that played out 60 years ago acquired a startlingly fresh resonance.</p><p>In May 1962, Nikita Khrushchev came up with an idea that he thought was brilliant: to send nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles to the island of Cuba – without the US knowing. This impetuous project, hastily implemented, resulted in the greatest incident of nuclear brinkmanship in history. In his oral recollections, edited by his son Sergei, Khrushchev elaborated his motives. He feared arrogant Americans would attempt to overthrow the Castro regime, thereby humiliating the Soviet Union, Cuba’s sponsor. The missiles were sent as a deterrent.</p><p>Vladislav Zubok is professor of international history at the London School of Economics and author of Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union, which was a finalist for the 2022 Cundill history prize</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/22/sixty-years-cuban-missile-crisis-us-putin-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

We’ve been through 18 months of grief, fear and disruption. Just as life is beginning to return to normal for many, warnings of a sinister new variant spread. People are searching for reassurance, distraction. Or, failing that, just something that doesn’t have its own designated horseman of the apocalypse.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/23/what-is-wordle-the-new-viral-word-game-delighting-the-internet" title="">Wordle</a> comes along at the perfect time. Its creator, Josh Wardle, a software engineer living in Brooklyn, invented it that summer to entertain his partner, Palak Shah. It’s a simple pleasure: there’s a hidden word and, using powers of deduction, you have six attempts to figure out what it is. The game was never intended for public consumption – it was only after it became a hit on the family WhatsApp that Wardle began to think it might have wider appeal. And, sure enough, by the end of the year millions were playing and sharing their results on social media. It spawned a Spanish language version, then <a href="https://arwordle.netlify.app/" title="">Arabic</a>, French, Swedish and Japanese. It inspired joyful imitations: <a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/" title="">Worldle</a>, where you have to guess a country from its shape; <a href="https://emovi.teuteuf.fr/" title="">Emovi</a>, where you have to figure out the film from a plot sketched in emoji. Key to all of them was a mechanism that acted as a counterweight to our hyperactive online lives: there was only one round a day, and the solution was the same for everyone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/22/i-was-asked-to-invent-the-next-wordle-how-hard-could-it-be">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Soapy, slick and thoroughly enjoyable, this series about the battle to inherit a Black beauty brand is like Empire meets Dynasty meets Footballers’ Wives. It’s confident, escapist fun</p><p>There is a moment during a particularly climactic scene in the big, juicy melodrama that is Riches (ITVX) in which a scorned wife throws a bowl full of fruit across a boardroom table and screams, “You bitch!” It’s a good indication of the level of bombast this fantastically over-the-top series is going for, which seems to be Empire meets Dynasty meets Footballers’ Wives. So far, the new dramas launched by ITVX have been pretty straight and serious, but this is far more tongue-in-cheek. It is soapy, slick and thoroughly enjoyable.</p><p>Hugh Quarshie is Stephen Richards, the founder and boss of Flair and Glory, a Black hair and beauty brand so successful it has turned him into a titan of British industry. Riches begins with Stephen conveniently doing an interview with a journalist, allowing him to give us plenty of background on the story. Nobody would lend him the money to start the business, he explains. They said Black models don’t sell magazines. Nobody believed in his vision. But now look where he is. This is the kind of show that is built on buildings filled with framed magazine covers on the wall, big leather sofas and floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Stephen has made it, and his family is filthy rich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/22/riches-review-juicy-melodrama-rotten-roots-filthy-rich">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Edelman signed $9.6m in deals with the Saudi government over the past four years to sanitize the Islamic kingdom’s image</p><p>Richard Edelman, the CEO of the $1bn public relations firm Edelman, published a <a href="https://www.edelman.com/insights/davos-mid-year-6-am">blog post</a> in June reflecting on his trip to the elite gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Russia had invaded Ukraine only months earlier and Edelman’s report focused on his geopolitical observations. “I left Davos inspired by the bravery of the Ukrainians and Poles,” Edelman wrote, “[and] more convinced than ever about the global rift between democracy and autocracy.”</p><p>That rift is real. Around the world, “autocracy is making gains against democracy”, as the human rights nonprofit Freedom House <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-authoritarian-rule-challenging-democracy-dominant-global-model">put it</a>. Yet the rift between democracy and autocracy that Edelman rightly identified has not stopped his company from signing at least $9.6m (£7.9m) worth of contracts over the past four years with one of the world’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-economy-reforms-analysis/analysis-how-rich-is-saudi-arabia-kingdom-does-the-math-in-balance-sheet-overhaul-idUSKBN2AN0GZ">richest</a> autocracies: the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/edelman-saudi-arabia-pr-image">Continue reading...</a>

## Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski: ‘Of all Tom Cruise’s characters, Maverick might be closest to his real personality’

<p>The belated sequel to Top Gun is easily the highest-grossing film of 2022 – as well as Tom Cruise’s most successful movie ever. Its director explains how hard it was to make the film and why its star never, ever gives up</p><p><strong>In 1990, Tom Cruise told Playboy he wouldn’t make Top Gun 2, for fear it might glorify or gamify war. What changed?<br /></strong>It’s a film about competition and friendship and sacrifice. It was never a film about war. We wanted to give people insight into a world and to experience what it’s like to ride in one of these machines. But the desire was to tell an emotive story about a guy in his 50s. The push was: what’s the audience feeling about that? We were pretty ruthless in making sure that we were always pushing that story, even in an action scene.</p><p><strong>Does it feel strange to still be discussing something you shot in 2018?<br /></strong>It is a little weird. The pandemic is a strange, two-year gap we all have. I’m just relieved the movie worked out and was released in the way we wanted. There was a lot of pressure on Tom [Cruise] and Jerry [Bruckheimer, the producer] to put it out on streaming. I’m glad we waited because we made it for the big screen and I think it was the movie that a lot of people came back to cinemas to see.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/22/top-gun-maverick-director-joseph-kosinski-interview-tom-cruise">Continue reading...</a>

## The Things That We Lost by Jyoti Patel review – a family history unlocked

<p>A British Asian teenager uncovers the secrets of his parents’ past in an assured, affecting debut with a dual narrative</p><p>In Jyoti Patel’s searching debut novel, there are things Nik knows and things he doesn’t. He is Indian, but he doesn’t know India; it’s not his home, not really. Growing up in a British-Kenyan-Gujarati household in Harrow, London, he notes the difference between being asked where he’s from by someone who is brown or Black, and someone who is white. “The former rings of solidarity, allyship, while the latter of othering, of suspicion.” His identity, he realises, “is like a pair of scales; the weight of the answer depending on the intention of the person asking”. Yet it’s not his own identity but his family history about which Nik seeks answers. And when his grandfather dies, leaving him with a key – literally – to the well-guarded secrets of his parents’ past, including his father’s sudden death, it’s the prompt for a long-grieving and unraveling family to find some semblance of closure.</p><p>So this is both a mystery story and a coming-of-age tale, narrated from the dual perspectives of mother and son, Avani and 18-year-old Nik. The Things That We Lost travels back and forth between Avani’s adolescent years as a British Indian in 1980s London, and Nik’s experiences as a mixed-race young man in post-Brexit Britain. Decades apart, their experiences are mirrored: not much has changed in the racial prejudice they encounter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/22/the-things-that-we-lost-by-jyoti-patel-review-a-family-history-unlocked">Continue reading...</a>

## Christmas trees cost more this year. Maybe it’s time to cut your own

<p>A US forest service initiative encourages people to cut their own trees in an effort to maintain healthy forests</p><p>Perched atop a snow-laced ridge in the Mendocino national forest of northern California, the perfect Christmas tree seemed to glow in the speckled light. With delicate needles and a small stature, the 6ft evergreen was one of a few thousand available to be taken home by families participating in a government program encouraging people to harvest their own tree. <strong><br /><br /></strong>The decades-old initiative, run by the US Forest Service, has become a beloved tradition for those seeking a side of adventure along with a cherished tree. Each year, 200,000 to 300,000 trees are taken home from forests across the country. It’s part of a seasonal cull that forest managers say improves a forest’s health and helps weed out potential fire hazards.</p><p>But compared with commercial tree farm sales, self-harvesting is a vastly underutilized option. Roughly <a href="https://realchristmastrees.org/2022/11/03/what-ncta-wants-everyone-to-know-about-the-farm-grown-christmas-tree-supply-for-2022/">21m Christmas trees were bought</a> last year according to the National Christmas Tree Association, a grower’s trade group, with consumers forking over more than $70 on average a pop. Inflation and low supply are pushing prices even higher, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/your-money/christmas-tree-cost-inflation.html">an expected 10% bump</a> this holiday season.

It starts out with an (unhappily) married couple celebrating their anniversary at a resort in Mexico. Something in the past has caused their emotional detachment to each other, but we’re given no explanation at first. Then the show starts to transcend genre as the couple become involved in the mysterious disappearance of two teenagers 10 years previously. There is comedy, mystery, mysticism, slapstick, a hurricane and a barnstorming performance by Luis Gerardo Méndez as the wannabe detective Baltasar Frias. We also maybe see time travel.

<p>Mark Spencer says government wants to reduce ‘red tape’ after UK firms say Brexit deal has not boosted business</p><p>Demand for NHS services is expected to go up after yesterday’s ambulance strike in England and Wales. In an interview this morning Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of <strong>NHS Providers</strong>, which represents health trusts, said that demand was “significantly down” yesterday, but that that would change. She said:</p><p>What we think today, tomorrow, the next few days will bring us, actually, is quite a surge in demand for emergency treatment, people turning up at A&amp;E, potentially calling ambulances because they are in a condition that has significantly deteriorated.</p><p>[The model] maintains that by membership of the EU the UK economy will do better but then goes on to argue that this country should not be compared to the economies of Germany, France and Italy but to faster growing nations. These two arguments contradict each other.</p><p>If as the CER says the major continental economies are inherently slower growth than the UK surely we would want to be less associated with them and freer to operate globally. The fact that, since we voted to leave, we have performed better than all the major European economies save France, shows our success.</p><p>Just because countries are of a similar size in a similar region, they do not necessarily have a similar economic model or growth rates. Better doppelgänger countries may be found elsewhere by the algorithm. Indeed, the UK’s growth rate between the introduction of the euro in 1999 and 2016 was markedly different to France, Germany and Italy’s. It was far closer to that of the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/dec/22/brexit-uk-economy-politics-conservatives-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the northern hemisphere where naughty children are kept in line with frightening tales, receiving a lump of coal is the least of their worries</p><p>It is that time of year when we settle down with a glass of mulled wine and our thoughts turn to all things Christmas. While we all enjoy the merriment and the baubles, trimmings and greenery of the Christmas tree, there is a side to the season that can easily bring a sudden chill. In several cultures in the northern hemisphere, the yuletide winter solstice has brought considerable trepidation. For centuries, communities throughout Europe were mainly rural and thus at the mercy of nature, so it isn’t surprising that people felt themselves to be the governed by supernatural forces.</p><p>In Iceland at this time of year, when daylight only lasts around four to five hours, the medieval Icelanders believed it was a time when ghosts would roam the land. One Iceland saga called the Eyrbyggja includes the story of a farmer who invites his neighbours to a Christmas feast, only to have ghosts accompany them. He advises them to shake the mud off of their clothes and spray the other guests with it. Those who try to stop them fall sick and die. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/22/from-easily-angered-gnomes-to-child-eating-giants-european-folklore-reveals-a-darker-side-to-christmas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dancing brings joy and has huge health benefits, but would-be older clubbers like me too often meet suspicion and derision</p><p>Christmas represents a brief relaxation of the ban on over-45s dancing in public. There will be house parties, office parties, cleared kitchen spaces and lounge carpets, and possibly some marquees. For a few weeks only we will stand up, survey the risks, feel the music’s pull, let our guard down and allow the world to see us twist and bob. Initially, we will be cautious, our faces all raised-eyebrow self-mockery, just in case. But once we are sure it’s safe, we will be free again, free to move in ways not normally permitted to the unyoung.</p><p>The ageism around clubbing is unquestioned. A recent survey into when people stop going dancing <a href="https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/too-old-clubbing-age-survey-2833906">found we retreat at about 37</a>.

Luckily, this week sees one of Stormzy’s musical collaborators and his therapist pal launch a new mental health podcast that takes listeners through the benefits of therapy – as well as when it might be helpful. Couldn’t be better timed.<br /><br />Elsewhere, we’re delving into the world of documentary podcasts, with a selection of excellent deep dives ranging from the tale of one of Hong Kong’s most wanted men to a thoughtful look at online trolling. Recommendations this week also include Tim Key telling oddball tales about London pubs, and the story of a scammer who was arrested while recovering from a “Brazilian butt lift”.

## A Year on Planet Earth review – Stephen Fry is no Attenborough in deja vu-inducing nature show

<p>The QI host has a lovely tone of voice, but very nearly fumbles the ‘national treasure’ baton – by lapsing into non-sequiturs during wildlife footage we’ve seen before</p><p>Stephen Fry’s impersonation of David Attenborough starts unpromisingly. “It’s hard to describe,” he says from his wintry perch in the Arctic Circle, “how still it is on a glacier surrounded by a fresh blanket of snow.” Then you must try harder, Mr Fry, given that you’re presenting a programme that celebrates the wilderness in its few remaining minutes before being repurposed as luxury flats.</p><p>To be fair, at the outset of A Year on Planet Earth (ITVX), Fry perfectly nails the tremulous throb of awe at nature’s glorious wildness. It’s like watching Frozen Planet III narrated by a different national treasure. But then Fry has to sully these achievements with his second sentence. He follows his inability to describe glacial stillness with: “Which makes the fact that I am moving at over 490,000 miles an hour more extraordinary.” No, it doesn’t. His struggles to offer adjectives about snow really have nothing to do with how extraordinary his velocity is. David Attenborough’s script editors would have spotted that non-sequitur before broadcast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/22/a-year-on-planet-earth-review-stephen-fry-is-no-attenborough-in-deja-vu-inducing-nature-show">Continue reading...</a>

## Cells: Memories for My Mother by Gavin McRea – confronting the past

<p>Returning to Dublin after his mother is diagnosed with dementia, the Irish novelist faces the family he’d left behind</p><p>In the last 20 years of her life, the artist Louise Bourgeois created a series of small architectural spaces that she named Cells. Each of them contained objects arranged to evoke rooms from her past, along with the trauma that occurred inside them. Encountering them at an exhibition, Gavin McCrea, who is the author of two novels, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/25/mrs-engels-gavin-mccrea-review-historical" title="">Mrs Engels</a> (2015) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/16/the-sisters-mao-review-dazzlingly-ambitious-yet-modestly-human" title="">The Sisters Mao</a> (2021), found himself overwhelmed with sadness and grief. While the contents of Bourgeois’s Cells were specific to the artist, McCrea recognised “in their pattern and their ordering, in their blending and their juxtaposition, in their communicating and their clashing, the episodes and moods of my own childhood”.</p><p>Cells, then, is McCrea’s own exhibition piece, a raw and deeply affecting memoir in which he reconstructs and dissects traumatic scenes from his past. The youngest of four siblings born and raised in Dublin, McCrea left home in his early 20s having determined to close the door on his upbringing. “What I have since learned,” he notes, “is that this hatred of my past is really just an acknowledgement of an element of my psyche that will never be eradicated. Within the instinct … to leave behind, there will always remain traces of a contrary instinct: the one which will send me searching for the way back.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/22/cells-memories-for-my-mother-by-gavin-mcrea-confronting-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

## Augusta’s LIV decision shows the Masters is looking out for itself | Ewan Murray

<p>The true feelings of those in charge at Augusta remain hard to read but it is clear that locking out players is not good for business</p><p>The air of mystique surrounding Augusta National ensures a captive audience even when there is precious little to say. It would have been major news had the host club of the Masters announced that LIV rebels would be banned from the 87th staging of the major. Instead, in somewhat grudging and opaque terms, the tournament chairman, Fred Ridley, confirmed LIV players already eligible for April in Georgia – 16 of them, to be precise – will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/20/liv-players-will-not-be-banned-from-2023-masters-says-augusta-national-golf">not encounter roadblocks</a> at the end of Magnolia Lane.</p><p>The Masters is looking after itself. This is the same policy adopted by the R&amp;A in respect to the Open. It will be an identical approach from the PGA of America and the United States Golf Association when it comes to the US PGA Championship and the US Open respectively. Locking out players, some of them carrying a high profile and some of them former champions, is not good for business. Cameron Smith, an LIV convert, is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/17/golf-cameron-smith-wins-open-championship-glory-rory-mcilroy">holder of the Claret Jug</a>. Television companies and sponsors would want to know why their “product” was being diminished for reasons separate to the tournament. Ridley, Martin Slumbers (his equivalent at the R&amp;A) and the rest do not much fancy those conversations. So, instead, they tiptoe through the tulips. If this is partly understandable, it is also more than a little deflating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/22/augustas-liv-decision-shows-the-masters-is-looking-out-for-itself">Continue reading...</a>

I knew already that I still wanted lots of vain, self-serving things, like the professional admiration of a certain kind of serious male writer, or for everyone I know to be aware of it when I manage to run for more than seven minutes. I want people to think I’m talented and nice-looking and fun, but I thought I’d left the need for cool behind.</p><p>There was a period in my late teens and early 20s when to have my photograph taken at a club night felt like the most important thing in the world. My life at the time had been swiftly vacated of meaning, structure and any events beyond partying: I had the feeling that nightlife could be a real community, that it meant something beyond getting wasted and finding someone to sleep with. I had the feeling that coolness was something attainable and tangible, that it could be the redemptive twist I needed after some difficult years. I thought that coolness could save me.</p><p>Megan Nolan is an Irish writer based in London.

<p><strong>(Domino)<br /></strong>Asha Lorenz and Louis O’Bryen swerve from hints of the Kinks to traces of Lou Reed with lyrics of pure youthful dread in this reflective, honest album</p><p>Several acts have put out quick-witted, affecting guitar music this year, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/wet-leg-wet-leg-album-review-chaise-longue-domino">Wet Leg</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/21/dry-cleaning-stumpwork-review-deadpan-chat-funk-and-hypnotic-soundscapes">Dry Cleaning</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/03/nilufer-yanya-painless-review-second-album">Nilüfer Yanya</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/yard-act-the-overload-album-review">Yard Act</a>.

Lyrically, Anywhere But Here deals in loneliness, love and the anonymity of the city. But there’s enough melodic sweetness in there to make sure it doesn’t feel needlessly sullen.</p><p>Sorry founders Asha Lorenz and Louis O’Bryen grew up with YouTube algorithms flicking them from one genre to the next, and, in turn, they swerve between styles on Anywhere But Here. Lorenz has said she wanted to channel 1970s songwriters such as Carly Simon and Randy Newman. The lullaby-like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYrNlsRp7Dk">Willow Tree</a> has a bit of the Kinks to it, and you can hear the ghosts of Lou Reed and Daniel Johnston in the melodies and backing vocals of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEPWy2rvCIY">There’s So Many People That Want To Be Loved</a>. The lyrics, though, are pure, youthful dread: “I know that you’re somewhere out there / Getting fucked in someone else’s bed,” Lorenz sings on the dark, downtempo Key to the City.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/22/sorry-anywhere-but-here-review-domino">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Updated official data shows UK GDP contracted by 0.3% in July-September, worse than previously thought</p><p><strong>Another worrying sign in today’s GDP report -– UK business invesment contracted by 2.5% in the third quarter of the year.</strong></p><p>It means that business investment (on, say, new machinery or expanding a factory) is over 8% below its levels before the Covid-19 pandemic began.</p><p>Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased by 1.1% in Quarter 3 2022, revised down from a first estimate increase of 2.5%. The latest quarterly rise was mainly driven by a boost in government investment of 17.3%, although business investment is now estimated to have fallen by 2.5% in Quarter 3 2022.</p><p>Business investment saw notable revisions to estimates across quarters because of updated survey data.</p><p>Within RHDI, nominal gross disposable income rose 1.8%. With the adjustment for the change in pension entitlements not affecting the calculation of disposable income, growth in social benefits other than social transfers in kind, and wages and salaries drove nominal income growth this quarter.</p><p>However, the household expenditure implied deflator grew by 2.4%, therefore outpacing nominal income growth. This is weaker inflation growth than seen in the previous quarter as price growth on spending at restaurants and cafes as well as on UK tourist expenditure overseas eased slightly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/dec/22/uk-economy-shrank-q3-household-incomes-shrink-recession-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Age of Vice by Deepti Kapoor review – India’s answer to The Godfather

<p>This ambitious crime thriller is an epic story of political and moral corruption</p><p>The inciting incident of Age of Vice, a horrific collision between dissolute wealth and harsh poverty, marks out the central theme from the very start. It’s 2004 in New Delhi and a speeding Mercedes with a drunk driver at the wheel ploughs into a group of street sleepers, killing five. This symbolic yet seemingly senseless act also binds together the three main protagonists of an impressively ambitious literary thriller: Sunny Wadia, the playboy scion of a major criminal family; Neda Kapur, an investigative journalist; and Ajay, a hapless footsoldier in the Wadias’ nefarious business empire. Their lives interweave in an epic story of political and moral corruption in contemporary India. With intricate yet plausible plotting, the book has all the energy of a high-concept crime thriller. What makes it compelling is the emotional intelligence of Kapoor’s characterisations.</p><p>We start with Ajay, born into squalor and privation in Uttar Pradesh. A lower-caste boy, he is “less than poor”. Sold into slavery at the age of eight and serving in a backpacker cafe by his teens, he slowly works his way up to become a “Wadia man”, as Sunny’s valet and bodyguard. Ajay’s picaresque struggle provides some kind of moral compass to our tale, and a ground zero from which to view the vicious hierarchies we encounter on the way. He seems to rise up, yet every material gain brings a spiritual loss of self. When he tries to do the right thing, he is simply used as a fall guy, but pushed too far, he is eventually driven by a heartbreaking quest for revenge and redemption.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/22/age-of-vice-by-deepti-kapoor-review-indias-answer-to-the-godfather">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The midwife forgot to register my exemption from charges when my pregnancy was confirmed</p><p><strong>I received a £100 fine from NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) for claiming free prescriptions, although I’m exempt from charges because I’m pregnant. It seems my midwife forgot to register my exemption when my pregnancy was confirmed in June. The application was resubmitted in October, with a letter explaining the error, but my certificate was only backdated by a month. NHSBSA now says it will remove the fine if £70 of prescription fees are paid within 60 days. I normally have a prepayment certificate for my medication, but stopped it in June when I was told I was exempt. I’m now expected to pay more than the prepayment certificate would have been, during a time I was entitled to free prescriptions.<br /></strong><em><strong>LH, Telford, Shropshire</strong></em></p><p>Essentially, the NHS is fining you for a mistake of the NHS’s own making. NHSBSA is the public body responsible for cracking down on prescription fraud, but penalises many who can show they claimed in good faith. In your case, it’s not NHSBSA that is to blame, but the government rules that bind it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/22/nhs-has-fined-me-for-claiming-free-prescriptions-because-of-its-own-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From festive insults to ropey charity singalongs – all clearly shot at the wrong time of year – seasonal specials from the likes of Towie are a comical joy. Hopefully their days aren’t numbered …</p><p>For superfans of The Only Way Is Essex, Christmas was cancelled months ago. In October it was announced that due to budget concerns, the annual Towie Christmas special, The Only Way Is Essexmas, had been axed. For 11 out of the 12 years the show has been broadcast, the special has aired, and its cancellation has raised questions about the show’s future, amid declining ratings and a shrinking cast.</p><p>Though I stopped watching Towie some time ago, I too felt saddened by the news. In the same way lapsed EastEnders fans dip back into the show on Christmas Eve, I like to check in on what the Towie lot are up to once a year. Watching Chloe Sims and her sisters pretend to open presents in matching pyjamas is as synonymous with the season as putting up the tree. The Christmas episode has always been one of its standouts; Towie broke the mould with a notoriously dire live recording in 2012 and cemented their status as a festive harbinger in the public imagination by recording a Christmas charity single covering Wham!’s Last Christmas. The cancellation of its festive special might mark the beginning of the end of the series, but I hope it doesn’t mark the beginning of the end of something far bigger: the reality TV Christmas special.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/22/there-is-nothing-on-tv-more-disorientating-the-brilliant-weirdness-of-the-reality-tv-christmas-special">Continue reading...</a>

So spare yourself the annual round-ups in the newspapers or the boy-scout enthusiasm of podcasters.

<p>Crime writer McDermid, 67, kept seeing geography professor Sharp, 53, at literary events. They eventually had a drink at the bar in 2013 and now live together in Edinburgh</p><p>In February 2013, crime writer Val McDermid was invited to speak at the University of Oxford. “It was at my old college of St Hilda’s,” she says. When she spotted she had been tagged on Twitter by an attendee, she felt nervous. “I’d had an unfortunate incident a few months before – someone had thrown ink in my face at a signing,” she says. “This tweet had a cartoon profile image rather than a picture, so I looked her up to make sure she was a real person.”</p><p>She discovered her new Twitter fan was Jo Sharp, a geography professor from Glasgow. “I was in Oxford doing some research,” says Jo. “I’d contacted a professor I knew there, to meet up. She told me she was going to see Val McDermid speak and I could come along.” Jo decided to go even though she had not read any of Val’s books. She tweeted the details of the event, tagging Val in her post. “My friend was a huge fan of her writing, so we stayed afterwards to be introduced,” says Jo. When she told Val she wasn’t from Oxford, Val admitted she already knew. “I told her I’d Googled her,” she laughs. “There was definitely something that caught my attention.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/22/how-val-mcdermid-met-jo-sharp-i-googled-her-to-make-sure-she-was-a-real-person">Continue reading...</a>

I was fresh out of home, working two jobs, trying to start up a comedy career and occasionally selling my blood to medical experiments to make ends meet. I am not making that up but I’m also not explaining it. At this time, dinner was a simple meal I called Bachelor Chow. It consisted of the cheapest canned tuna available, half a packet of microwave rice from the case of rice I’d stolen from the university promo people, and if I’d landed a paid gig that week perhaps something a little exotic like a sauce or a bit of spinach. That was living. Nothing ignites the senses like microwave tuna. Bourdain would be proud.</p><p>Now, I catch myself searching for tarragon, blanching my vegetables and asking friends for the ingredients in a dressing or saying, “You’ve got to send me the recipe.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/22/i-moved-to-the-city-and-became-an-unbearable-food-snob-but-theres-no-taste-like-home">Continue reading...</a>
