this party. Slight and dainty, she's the niece of a posh lord. She hides her jawline beneath a fan, smiles with glittering power as she is invited to the card table. Her hands are always bad and her grasp of the rules seems tenuous. Forgetting her knife-sharp grin, you settle into a wine-fuelled haze. Only when the night is over do you count your coins, realize how much you've lost, and think again of that shining smile.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In its broad survey of French aristocracy, Card Shark allows players to explore crossdressing and queerness. The game's tangible relationship to history is playful, broad, and particular (<a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/card-shark-game-historical-influences/\">as I've written about before</a>). Card Shark freely borrows tricksters and cheats from throughout history but also shows off the unique class-bridging function of card playing in the specific time period. Card Shark's France is broiling with class friction, as a rising bourgeoisie has increasing power but is also isolated from the immense wealth of the ruling aristocracy. Underneath it all, Romani caravans avoid persecution and the revolution brews. Player character Eugene and his mentor, the Comte de Saint Germain, will explore all this through cheating at the aforementioned card games, amassing wealth, and discovering a mystery at the heart of the French monarchy. While the story told is largely fiction, a combination of The Three Musketeers and a satirical comedy of manners, the social circumstances of the characters are grounded in a material history. That extends to Card Shark's depiction of crossdressing, gender nonconformity, and transness.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/card-sharks-take-on-historical-gender-is-both-playful-and-enlightening/1100-6510056/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/card-sharks-take-on-historical-gender-is-both-playful-and-enlightening/1100-6510056/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2022-12-22 17:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Elden Ring Hits Lowest Price Ever On PC", "description": "<p>Elden Ring won all sorts of accolades in 2022, including <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2022/1100-6509957/\">GameSpot\u2019s Game of the Year Award</a>.

From a high-level perspective, it's got all the trappings of a classic Legend of Zelda adventure, from color-coded McGuffins to collect, to distinct biomes that require certain tools and tricks to navigate through. For much of the game's opening, it sticks strictly to a formula you're mostly familiar with, inviting the desire for something new just as it introduces it with generosity. From that point on, Tunic is entirely its own thing, eschewing any assumptions you might have made about its structure and delivering an engrossing, surprising, adventure.</p><p>Central to this feat is a core mechanic that feels unique to Tunic: an in-game manual. When you pause Tunic, you're presented with a fuzzy view of the game world as a backdrop to a crisp game manual; a neat little trick that informs you that you're not actually playing Tunic; you're playing as someone else playing it instead. As you explore Tunic's world, you'll uncover new lost pages for this game manual, inviting you to immediately pause and inspect them. Many, initially, are simple tutorials; hit this button to attack, use this one to block, and be aware that you can use these simple items in these basic ways.</p><p>The fundamentals of Tunic are portrayed in the more eye-catching pieces of information details on each page, but its more-fascinating hints are strewn around its periphery. Little pencil etchings make references to symbols you may or may not have seen before, with supplementary printed imagery that doesn't make sense within the context of the core messaging you've already gleaned from the page in question. Like the world that it's describing, this game manual is its own puzzle; one that unlocks secrets within the world, leading you to more pages to help piece together its much larger, hidden message.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tunics-in-game-manual-gives-mechanical-importance-to-collectibles/1100-6509945/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tunics-in-game-manual-gives-mechanical-importance-to-collectibles/1100-6509945/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2022-12-22 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The 10 Biggest Entertainment Stories Of 2022, From Whatever Is Happening At Warner Bros.

With theaters open, we got big budget movies at a remarkable clip. There were also a number of big time corporate shake ups, Elon Musk buying/ruining Twitter, the loss of some beloved stars, and even an Avatar movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's right, it may have taken 13 years, but we actually finally got to see Avatar 2! We also got a new Batman film, more Marvel movies than we can count, an upcoming relaunch of the DC movies universe, and huge creative changes at WWE.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It felt like now is as good a time as any to look back on 2022 and recount the biggest entertainment stories of the year. Can you believe the Will Smith/Chris Rock Oscars slap happened this year? While it seems like something from a decade ago, we can guarantee you that it went down in 2022 and made the list because how could it not?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As you settle in to enjoy the holidays and count down the end of another year, take a look below at the 10 news stories that truly rocked the entertainment industry, for better or worse. Then do yourself a favor and take a look at the best <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-top-movies-of-2022/2900-4560/\">movies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-tv-shows-of-2022/2900-4550/\">TV shows</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2022/2900-4517/\">games</a> that GameSpot loved in 2022.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Bob Iger's Disney return</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079783-iger.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This was certainly something none of us saw coming. After retiring from his job as the head of the Walt Disney Company, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bob-iger-to-replace-bob-chapek-as-disney-ceo-just-months-after-chapek-got-big-contract-extension/1100-6509325/\">Bob Iger made his return to the company</a> just before Thanksgiving, replacing his own replacement. Bob Chapek was let go from the company, with Iger resuming his role as CEO. However, he's only back for two years and has been tasked with finding the right person to succeed him in the role--pointing to the idea that Chapek just wasn't getting the job done.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Kristina Bumphrey /Contributor</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Ezra Miller situation</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079779-ezra.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It was a rollercoaster year for Ezra Miller, who we will presumably next see starring in The Flash. After a slew of arrests and reports of erratic behavior, it was announced in August that the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-ezra-miller-has-begun-ongoing-treatment-for-complex-mental-health-issues/1100-6506534/\">actor has \"begun ongoing treatment.\"</a> There's no telling what, exactly, that entails. However, it was reported that at one point Warner Bros. Discovery was <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-reportedly-pauses-flash-actor-ezra-millers-projects-following-arrest/1100-6502247/\">considering shelving The Flash</a> indefinitely, unsure of how to proceed in the face of Miller's ongoing issues. Since the August news that they'd begun treatment, Miller has kept a relatively low profile. And thus far, all signs point to us finally seeing the Flash movie on June 23, 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Death of Kevin Conroy</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079784-kevin.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nobody lives forever, sadly, not even our heroes. The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-has-died/1100-6509107/\">loss of Kevin Conroy</a>, the longtime voice of Batman, rocked fans to their core. After first voicing the Dark Knight in Batman: The Animated Series in the '90s, Conroy kept on lending Bruce Wayne and his caped alter ego until his death at 66. Conroy's final performance as Batman will appear in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kevin-conroy-returns-as-batman-in-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-releasing-in-may/1100-6509892/\">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> video game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Albert L. Ortega/Contributor</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Death of Bob Saget</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079781-gettyimages-1237110161.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Another loss fans weren't ready for was the sudden death of Bob Saget, who became a household name in the late-'80s and early-'90s thanks to his starring role on Full House. In January of this year, the 65-year-old comedian was found dead in his hotel room while on tour. It was eventually determined that the cause of his death was an injury to the back of his head from what was believed to be an accidental fall.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/MICHAEL TRAN/Contributor</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Vince McMahon's retirement</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079780-gettyimages-139068027.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Most wrestling fans assumed Vince McMahon would rule over WWE as long as he was alive. Shockingly, that wasn't the case. Back in July, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-ceo-vince-mcmahon-retires-amid-scandal/1100-6505790/\">McMahon left the company</a> amid an <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vince-mcmahon-steps-back-as-wwe-ceo-amid-internal-investigation/1100-6504719/\">ongoing investigation</a> into sexual misconduct, which was revealed publicly by the Wall Street Journal. In his place, Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque took over control of WWE's creative output, while Stephanie McMahon and Nick Khan took on co-CEO roles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With McMahon gone, several massive changes have been made to WWE. A number of previously released talent have returned, while the War Games concept made its main roster debut at this year's Survivor Series event.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Michael N. Todaro/Stringer</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. The Oscar Slap</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079782-gettyimages-1239559678.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Does this one really need to be mentioned? Is there anyone out there that hasn't seen the clip of Will Smith walking onstage at the Oscars and slapping Chris Rock? It started when Rock made a joke about the bald head of Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, who has alopecia. It ended when Will Smith repeatedly and very publicly apologized for the act. Meanwhile, the Emancipation star has been banned from Academy events--including the Oscars--for a decade.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Myung Chun/Contributor</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Netflix's subscriber losses</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079777-3883021-cover.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">For a long time, Netflix seemed impervious to any kind of downfall, even when their own talent was making transphobic jokes and not being held accountable for it by the streamer. However, for the first time, Netflix experienced subscriber losses in April. The company announced at that time a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-loses-200000-subscribers-in-last-3-months-expects-2-million-more-to-leave-soon/1100-6502619/\">loss of 200,000 subscribers</a> for the first financial quarter of 2022, with an expected 2 million more canceling their service the quarter that followed.</p><p>The losses meant a lot of people at Netflix lost their jobs, a number of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-20-netflix-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022-so-far/2900-3977/\">shows were canceled</a>, some even before they ever premiered. Netflix has been able to bounce back from the losses, but now knows that the pool of subscribers isn't as endless as they once thought it was.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Whatever is happening at Warner Bros. Discovery</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079778-batgirl_movie-e1647382456666.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">When Warner Bros. and Discovery merged into a single mega-corporation, everyone expected costs to be cut. But what's happened at that company throughout 2022 has been utterly baffling. The most shocking decisions have been the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/17-tv-shows-and-movies-canceled-by-warner-bros-discovery/2900-4394/\">removal of beloved shows and movies</a> and upcoming projects--including some that have been filmed--being <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/26-hbo-max-original-shows-and-movies-pulled-from-the-service/2900-4288/\">canceled</a>, all in the name of tax cuts. The Batgirl film that was on the way will now never be seen, while <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-cancels-westworld-final-season-wont-happen/1100-6508933/\">Westworld was not only canceled</a> before finishing its story but will be outright <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/westworld-will-reportedly-be-removed-from-hbo-max-moved-to-another-service/1100-6509979/\">deleted from the HBO Max</a> streaming service, as if it never existed. What a bizarre series of decisions.</p><p>Ultimately, though, it all led to the installation of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-will-co-lead-dc-studios-steering-upcoming-dceu-movies-shows-and-cartoons/1100-6508620/\">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a> as the heads of DC Studios. Lots of big changes are coming to the DC universe and for the first time in a long time, we're excited about it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Henry Cavill out as Superman and The Witcher</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079776-2022-12-2114_59_23-henry-cavill-superman.jpg%281920%C3%971080%29.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It hasn't been a great year for Henry Cavill, though it was originally shaping up to be one. After making his highly-anticipated return to the DC universe in Black Adam as Superman, Cavill told the world he would play the superhero again in a new movie. However, then James Gunn and Peter Safran took over DC Studios and came up with their own plan. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/\">Cavill is out as Superman</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-confirms-black-adam-2-isnt-happening-at-dc-studios/1100-6510207/\">Black Adam 2 is dead</a> in the water).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/\">Cavill also left his other job</a> as the lead on Netflix's The Witcher. There's been no confirmation of why Cavill was departing the show, but many certainly believed it had to do with his upcoming Superman responsibilities.</p><p>It's not all bad news for the actor, though. He's now <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-becomes-driving-force-behind-prime-video-warhammer-40k-live-action-series/1100-6510131/\">developing a Warhammer 40,000 series for Amazon</a>, so that's something.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Avatar 2 finally actually happened</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4079775-2022-12-2114_54_48-mcdavat_fe094.jpg%281920%C3%971080%29.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">They said it would never happen, mostly because it was taking so long that it seemed impossible (and irresponsible, given the price tag). But in this, the year 2022, Avatar: The Way of Water was actually released. Over a decade after James Cameron made 3D cool again with the first Avatar film, his blue cat space opera entered its second chapter (of at least three, possibly five or more). The end result is a bunch of other great looking 3D and, if GameSpot's Mason Downey has it right in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-dead-in-the-water/1900-6418013/\">his review</a>, not much else.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After a week in theaters, Avatar was nearing the half billion mark at the box office. And while that might sound like a bunch of money, it's actually an underperforming title given how much was spent to make and market the film. That said, there's still plenty of time for Avatar 2 to swim its way to profit. We'll see you again in 2024 when the next movie also looks pretty.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-10-biggest-entertainment-stories-of-2022-from-whatever-is-happening-at-warner-bros-to-avatar-2-being-a-real-movie/2900-4564/", "date_published": "2022-12-22 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Sims 5: Release Date, Gameplay, And Everything We Know", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past, a new The Sims title has been released every five years, making The Sims 4's forthcoming 9th anniversary an unprecedented event for developer Maxis. Considering the series' ever-expanding push towards a live-service model and expansion packs, this kind of longevity makes sense--after all, any devoted Simmer will tell you the game is <em>quite</em> an investment and, if you're shelling out all your hard-earned simoleons on DLC, it's nice to know you have a fair bit of time left with the game before its shiny, new version hits shelves. However, as we draw closer to a decade of The Sims 4, many players have been asking the same question: Where is The Sims 5?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thankfully, we now have some answers. Though Maxis has historically kept quiet about development on new The Sims games before release, only revealing upcoming projects well after the bulk of development was completed, all that has changed with the announcement of Project Rene.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Revealed during <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-is-now-in-development-heres-a-first-look-at-its-build-mode/1100-6508378/\">2022's Behind the Sims Summit</a>, Project Rene is the working title for the next generation of The Sims, presumably to be titled The Sims 5. According to Maxis, the studio behind the popular life-simulation franchise, Simmers have quite a long wait until they'll be able to play the series' next installment. However, this wait is for a good reason: Throughout now and launch, the developers at Maxis plan to share content and use player feedback to create a game more in line with fan expectations than ever before.
