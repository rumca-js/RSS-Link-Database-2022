As always, we have looked for games that generally offer meaningful improvements over their last-gen counterparts when played on PS5, or are exclusive to the system. Our 2022 update sees two third-party titles \u2013 <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> \u2013 join the overwhelmingly Sony fray. We'll be updating this periodically, so, if a game's just been released and you don't see it, chances are that the reason for its absence is that we haven't played through it yet. Either that or we hate it.</p><h2>Stray</h2><p></p><p><em>Stray</em> a perfectly contained adventure game that has you embodying a cat in a post-apocalyptic world humans have left behind. It has plenty of fresh ideas, each one pared down to its purest form. Plenty of actions in <em>Stray</em> exist simply because they make sense for a cat protagonist (and probably because they\u2019re cute as hell). There\u2019s a discrete button to meow, and the robots the cat shares its world with react with shock and frustration when you cut across their board game, throwing pieces to the floor. It\u2019s possible to curl up and sleep basically any time, anywhere \u2013 even directly on top of a robot stranger. When the cat gets pets and cuddles from the robots, it purrs and the DualSense\u2019s haptics fire up in response. The environmental puzzles take advantage of this cat-level perspective, inviting players to look at the world with different, light-reflective eyes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As well as puzzle-solving, ledge-leaping and blob-dodging, <em>Stray</em> introduces a world of lighthearted dystopia, where robots don\u2019t hate the humans that came before them. Instead, they attempt to cultivate plants that can survive in the dark, just because people would have liked that. Compared with most dystopian cyberpunk games, <em>Stray</em> is downright joyful.</p><h2>God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k</h2><p></p><p>2018\u2019s <em>God of War</em> was a brilliant reinvention for a franchise that was in desperate need of a reboot. For an encore, all Sony\u2019s Santa Monica Studio did was every single stake they could. <em>God of War Ragnar\u00f6k </em>is a massive adventure, taking protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus all over the nine Norse realms as they prepare for Ragnar\u00f6k, a mythical event essentially meant to bring about the end of the world. Along the way, Kratos and Atreus get up close and personal with even more of the Norse gods, including stunning encounters with the drunken but deadly Thor and, of course, Odin himself.</p><p>The combat in <em>Ragnar\u00f6k</em> remains one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I can think of \u2013 it\u2019s fluid and extremely customizable. And once you get into a groove and power up Kratos, it\u2019s truly a god-like experience. There\u2019s also a much greater variety of enemies this time out, from the smaller grunts you mow through to bigger and more intense boss battles. There are more realms to visit, more sidequests than ever and an endgame sequence that\u2019s up there with the biggest battles any God of War game has ever put to screen. The backdrop for all this is some of the most beautifully detailed and varied environments you can find, from the swampy confines of Vanaheim and the fiery to the frozen tundra of Midgard. On the PS5, you can choose between native 4K visuals or high frame rates up to 120Hz, provided your TV can handle it.</p><h2>The Last of Us</h2><p></p><p><em>The Last of Us</em> and its sequel may have originally come out for the PS3 and PS4, respectively, but they also provide two excellent PS5 experiences. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> is a complete visual remake for the PS5 of the 2013 original, with massively improved character models and environments, along with native 4K visuals or frame rates up to 120 fps. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MYXN0LVVzLVBhcnQtSUktUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNC9kcC9CMDdESlJGU0RGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYeyu0p_pWAyd4mjRvmr54p4LzrpcsVkQLHQwtS4Ftws&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLast-Us-Part-II-PlayStation-4%2Fdp%2FB07DJRFSDF\"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> originally launched for the PS4 in 2020, and developer Naughty Dog released a patch for it last year unlocking 60 fps gameplay on the PS5. There weren\u2019t any other major updates, but the game already looked amazing on the PS4 so there wasn\u2019t a ton to change here. Either way, the PS5 is the best place to experience these two games.</p><p>Both games feature a sprawling post-pandemic adventure story, following survivors Joel and Ellie through a gorgeously rendered but terrifying world where zombie-like Infected and regular humans alike are out for your blood. You\u2019ll never really feel like you have enough supplies to survive, so you need to make every shot count \u2013 or figure out how to sneak around enemies or craft tools that\u2019ll get you out of tight spots. There\u2019s an ever-present sense of danger in these games, while the stories focus on human connection in all its messy glory; the tone is often extremely grim, but there are moments of levity, humor and hope sprinkled throughout the ruined world. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and <em>Part II</em> both put you through an intense, violent and emotional experience, but they remain a journey worth taking.</p><h2>Rollerdrome</h2><p></p><p><em>Rollerdrome</em> is lush. It\u2019s incredibly stylish, taking cues from 1970s Hollywood sci-fi but with an attractive cel-shaded filter over every scene. Even better than its stunning visuals, <em>Rollerdrome</em> has smooth, precise mechanics that allow players to fall into a flow in every level. The game is all about gliding through the environments on rollerblades, picking up speed and doing tricks while dodging and shooting enemies, managing weapons and controlling time \u2013 and it all comes together in a thrilling dystopian bloodsport.</p><p>It\u2019s a joy to dodge, dodge, dodge and then leap into the air, slow down time and take out the people shooting at you, refilling ammo and collecting health in the process. Meanwhile, an unsettling story of corporate greed unfolds naturally beneath the rollerblading bloodshed, keeping the stakes high. <em>Rollerdrome</em> was a sleeper hit of 2022, so if you\u2019ve been napping on this one, now\u2019s the time to wake up and play.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you\u2019ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It\u2019s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It\u2019s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you\u2019ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard\u2019s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Astro\u2019s Playroom</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s odd to start a best games list with a title that comes free with the console, but if you\u2019re anything like my son, who swiftly deleted <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvYXN0cm9zLXBsYXlyb29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAARyhZ2-STAUhBsc4fQ5UbMgeniWiOVLoWpihjV5FSKpr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fastros-playroom%2F\"><em>Astro\u2019s Playroom</em></a> to make space for various Call of Duty titles, I\u2019m here to tell you to give the pack-in title another shot. <em>Astro\u2019s Playroom</em> is a love letter to both 3D platformers and the PlayStation itself. It\u2019s also, to date, the title that makes the best use of Sony\u2019s DualSense controller, with incredible haptic feedback and clever usage of the pad\u2019s adaptive triggers. (Although, eight years on, I\u2019m still not convinced anyone has found a compelling reason for that touch pad.) It\u2019s a game that even completionists can finish within six hours or so, but those six hours were among the most fun I\u2019ve had with the PS5 so far.</p><h2><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</strong></h2><p></p><p>We thought it would never happen. <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> was an iconic JRPG that\u2019s credited with opening up the genre to the west. It peppered the Top 10 lists of the best games of all-time and introduced the long-running Japanese RPG series to polygons, 3D maps, and countless other innovations of 32-bit consoles. 23 years later, and three PlayStation iterations later, Square Enix dared to remake, not remaster, the game. It would be, contentiously, episodic, expanding out the story of Midgar and the opening part of the game into a single game.</p><p>It\u2019s all very different. It\u2019s also gorgeous, with a modern battle system that no longer focuses on static characters and menu choices. Somehow, and we were ready to be underwhelmed, the battle system works. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvcHJvZHVjdHMvZmluYWwtZmFudGFzeS12aWktcmVtYWtlLWludGVyZ3JhZGUtLS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LzI5Njk1NS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAafv3Epls3ZHNu7i50nd9W8E6u-MoLqkBxudJ5uF16H3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---playstation-5%2F296955.html%3F\"><em>FF7R\u2019s</em></a> fights are slicker and more enjoyable than those in Final Fantasy XV, the latest entry in the series. Each character, from iconic mercenary Cloud through to eco-terrorist Barret and flower girl Aerith, play in entirely different ways, using the space between themselves and enemies in very different ways. Some sub-missions and distractions feel like they\u2019re there solely to eke some more hours out of your playthrough, but the world of the original has been thoughtfully reimagined, so it\u2019s a minor complaint.</p><p>For anyone that bought the PS4 iteration, the upgrade to PS5 is free. However, it costs money to gain access to the PS5-exclusive DLC chapter featuring ninja Yuffie. Offering another battle style to experiment with and master, two new extra chapters run alongside the events of the first installment of this remake. Moments of the game feel like they were built to tease how capable the newest PlayStation is, with Yuffie zipping down poles through vertiginous levels, wall-running and mixing up long-range and short-range attacks in a completely different way to Cloud, Aerith and the rest. It suffers a little from trying to tie in <em>FF7</em> lore from old spin-off titles, but it\u2019s a satisfying distraction as we wait for the second part \u2013 <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> \u2013 to arrive in 2023.</p><h2>Demon's Souls</h2><p></p><p>Bluepoint\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EZW1vbnMtU291bHMtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNS9kcC9CMDhGQzVUVEJGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUF0PsZEHi2Zg-LFgwFicrQJiToXGJ6Ch6zVDmU354H3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDemons-Souls-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC5TTBF\"><em>Demon\u2019s Souls</em></a> remake won\u2019t be for everyone \u2014 no Souls game is. The original <em>Demon\u2019s Souls</em> was a sleeper hit in 2009 on the PS3, establishing the basic formula that would later be cemented with <em>Dark Souls</em>, and then aped by an entire industry to the point where we now essentially have a \u201cSoulslike'' genre. Today, that means challenging difficulty, grinding enemies for souls to level up, the retrieval of your corpse to collect said souls, a labyrinthine map to explore and, if you\u2019re doing Soulslike right, some show-stopping boss fights to contend with. As a progenitor to the genre, <em>Demon\u2019s Souls</em> has most of those in abundance. But rather than a huge sprawling map, it uses a portal system, with mini labyrinths to work through. Its bosses are also not quite on the level of impressiveness or difficulty of a more modern Dark Souls game.</p><p>Bluepoint has been faithful to the original, then, but graphically <em>Demon\u2019s Souls </em>is a true showcase of what the PS5 can do, with gorgeous high-resolution visuals, smooth frame rates and swift loading. While the graphics certainly catch your eye, it\u2019s the smoothness and loading times that are the most impactful. The original ran at 720p, and\u2026 depending on what you were doing 25 to 30 fps, while the remake lets you pick between a locked 30 or 60 fps at 4K or 1440p. And in a game that will likely kill you hundreds of times, waiting two seconds to respawn instead of thirty is transformative.</p><h2>God of War</h2><p></p><p>Sony's God of War series had laid dormant for half a decade when its latest incarnation hit stores in early 2018, and for good reason. Antiquated gameplay and troubling themes had made it an ill-fit for the modern gaming landscape. No more.

Kratos is now a dad, the camera is now essentially strapped to his shoulder and Sony has what is sure to become a new series on its hands.</p><p>The first outright PS4 game on this collection, <em>God of War</em> has at least been patched for better performance on PS5, allowing it to output at 4K/60.

There are multiple betrayals, the sad deaths of several close allies, tense sword fights, villages and castles under siege, and even a \u2018Kurosawa mode\u2019 black-and-white filter you employ for the entire game. The world of feudal Japan, with some creative liberties, is gorgeous, with fields of grass and bullrushes to race through on your faithful steed, temple \u2018puzzles\u2019 to navigate around and fortresses to assess and attack.</p><p>As you make your way through the main story quest, and more than enough side quests and challenges, you unlock more powerful sword techniques and stances, as well as new weapons and forbidden techniques that are neatly woven in the story of a samurai pushed to the edge. It still suffers from one too many fetch quests, artifacts scattered across Japan\u2019s prefectures, but the sheer beauty of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> tricks you into believing this is the greatest open-world game on PlayStation. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 it\u2019s up there.</p><p>With the new <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HaG9zdC1Uc3VzaGltYS1EaXJlY3RvcnMtQ3V0LVBTNS9kcC9CMDk4VFY1WFBYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARgfrm2sRkVOyaOOpEDs4J94q79CF_7IfAGfd7-N9qo1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGhost-Tsushima-Directors-Cut-PS5%2Fdp%2FB098TV5XPX%3F\"><em>Director\u2019s Cut</em></a> edition on the PS5, you also get dynamic frame-rates up to 60 FPS, ensuring the game looks and feels even more like a tribute to Japanese cinematic auteurs of the past. There are also DualSense tricks, like a bow that tangibly tightens as you pull on trigger buttons, and subtle rumble as you ride across the lands of Tsushima, <em>Director\u2019s Cut </em>adds a new, surprisingly compelling DLC chapter. As you explore the Iki isle, the game adds a few more tricks to Jin\u2019s arsenal, and deepens the relationship and history between the game\u2019s hero and his father.</p><p>Without spoiling what happens, the game smartly threads the original story into the DLC, ensuring it feels solidly connected to the main game, despite DLC status.</p><h2>Deathloop</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2RlYXRobG9vcC0tLXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvMjMyODUwLmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWAEepFdrgDmk9qK3G2VKJY-JF2vj9AMhIWZwXeKGDX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F232850.html%3F\"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, from the studio that brought you the Dishonored series, is easy enough to explain: You\u2019re trapped in a day that repeats itself. If you die, then you go back to the morning, to repeat the day again. If you last until the end of the day, you still repeat it again. Colt must \u201cbreak the loop\u201d by efficiently murdering seven main characters, who are inconveniently are never in the same place at the same time. It\u2019s also stylish, accessible and fun.</p><p>While you try to figure out your escape from this time anomaly, you\u2019ll also be hunted down by Julianna, another island resident who, like you, is able to remember everything that happens in each loop. She\u2019ll also lock you out of escaping an area, and generally interfere with your plans to escape the time loop. (The online multiplayer is also addictive, flipping the roles around. You play as Julianna, hunting down Colt and foiling his plans for murder. )</p><p>As you play through the areas again (and again) you\u2019ll equip yourself with slabs that add supernatural powers, as well as more potent weapons and trinkets to embed into both guns and yourself. It\u2019s through this that you\u2019re able to customize your playstyle or equip yourself in the best way to survive Julianna and nail that assassination. Each time period and area rewards repeat exploration, with secret guns, hidden conversations with NPCs and lots of world-building lore to discover for yourself.</p><h2>Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Ultimate Edition</h2><p></p><p>Finally, you don't have to pick up <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on the GameCube to get your web-slinging fix anymore. For almost 15 years, that game was held as the gold standard for a Spider-Man game, and I'll let you into a secret: It wasn't actually that good. <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, on the other hand, is a tour de force. Featuring the best representation of what it's like to swing through New York City, well, ever, Insomniac's PlayStation exclusive also borrows liberally from the Batman: Arkham series' combat and throws in a story that, although it takes a while to get going, ends up in a jaw-dropping place.</p><p>With the launch of the PS5, Insomniac released a <em>Miles Morales</em> spin-off game, which follows the eponymous character as he attempts to protect NYC in Peter Parker\u2019s absence. Both parts are available packaged together as <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21hcnZlbHMtc3BpZGVyLW1hbi1taWxlcy1tb3JhbGVzLXVsdGltYXRlLWVkaXRpb24tLS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LzIyNTM0MS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZZA74XiVAN7YoRsaRnrFR--B5EvrDn0jHlTByU91NQY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fmarvels-spider-man-miles-morales-ultimate-edition---playstation-5%2F225341.html%3F\"><em>Spider-Man Ultimate Edition</em></a>\u2014 it has a longer name than that but let's not \u2014 and benefit from improved framerates, resolution and ray tracing (although not necessarily all at the same time!) With the full graphical package enabled, you\u2019ll be playing at 30 frames per second in 4K, or you can pick between a pair of performance options: 4K/60 with no ray tracing, or 1080p/60 with ray-tracing. Whatever mode you pick, you\u2019ll benefit from loading times that finally make the game\u2019s fast travel system\u2026 fast.</p><h2>Resident Evil Village</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXNpZGVudC1FdmlsLVZpbGxhZ2UtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNS1TdGFuZGFyZC9kcC9CMDhUWUNXSzNDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQz8NecIvyAf97jSKuf5lrxEomIxgG0K7P9VWXZSN8vw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FResident-Evil-Village-PlayStation-5-Standard%2Fdp%2FB08TYCWK3C\"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> is delightful. It\u2019s a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game, and while this represents a fresh vibe for the franchise, it\u2019s not an unwelcome evolution. The characters and enemies in Village are full of life \u2014 even when they\u2019re decidedly undead \u2014 and Capcom has put a delicious twist on the idea of vampires, werewolves, sea creatures, giants and creepy dolls. The game retains its horror, puzzle and action roots, and it has Umbrella Corporation\u2019s fingerprints all over it. On PS5, the game is gorgeous and it plays nicely with the DualSense controller, adding haptic feedback to weapons and terrifying situations alike. It simply feels like developers had fun with this one, and so will you.</p><h2>Returnal</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvcHJvZHVjdHMvcmV0dXJuYWwtLS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LzIzNDQ3MC5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDUyZDY3MjktZjEzNi00NzVjLTliYzUtNThmOGUwZWJjYzY0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWI7_GcIaDdBnnDldmNe2DdpbqbQGbJSWgylHqHYXAW7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Freturnal---playstation-5%2F234470.html%3F\"><em>Returnal</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a third-person action game, a roguelite, a bullet-hell shooter and very hard, perhaps not in that order. The setup is basically that you\u2019re stuck in a death loop, but you\u2019re aware of it, and must learn the patterns and weaknesses of enemies \u2014 and master your own \u2014 in order to progress. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/returnal-review-ps5-shooter-133029657.html\">As <em>Devindra Hardwar </em>explains</a>, it leans heavily on the dark sci-fi of <em>Alien</em>,<em> Edge of Tomorrow</em> and <em>Event Horizon</em> but makes something new and unique in the process.</p><p>It\u2019s made by the team behind <em>Resogun</em>,<em> Nex Machina</em> and <em>Super Stardust HD</em>, and you can tell, for better or worse. As you\u2019d expect from a team that\u2019s spent the past decades making shooters, the movement, gunplay and enemy attack patterns are incredibly well tuned. But on the flipside, from a studio used to smaller productions, the complexity and ambition of <em>Returnal</em> leads to a lack of polish that some may find unacceptable in a $70 game. If you can look past that, there\u2019s a hell of a game waiting for you here.</p><h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWtpcm8tU2hhZG93cy1EaWUtVHdpY2UtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNC9kcC9CMDdESldCWUpOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NTJkNjcyOS1mMTM2LTQ3NWMtOWJjNS01OGY4ZTBlYmNjNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc4Vutg-7Mctuq7keOO2Sls8TJLTnhYALM99CdquyMiL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSekiro-Shadows-Die-Twice-PlayStation-4%2Fdp%2FB07DJWBYJN\"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a> isn't just another Dark Souls game. FromSoftware's samurai adventure is a departure from that well-established formula, replacing slow, weighty combat and gothic despair for stealth, grappling hooks and swift swordplay. Oh, and while it's still a difficult game, it's a lot more accessible than Souls games \u2014 you can even pause it! The result of all these changes is something that's still instantly recognizable as a FromSoftware title, but it's its own thing, and it's very good. While the game has yet to receive a proper PS5 upgrade, the extra grunt of Sony\u2019s next-gen console does allow the game to finally run at a locked 60fps \u2014 something the PS4 Pro couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-is-making-its-internal-video-blurring-privacy-tool-open-source-150052840.html?src=rss", "title": "Google is making its internal video-blurring privacy tool open source", "date_published": "2022-12-22 15:00:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Google has announced that two of its latest <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/06/28/advancing-a-vision-for-privacy-enhancing-technologies/\">privacy-enhancing technologies</a> (PETs), including one that blurs objects in a video, will be provided to anyone for free via open source.

For a company like Sony that's responsible for some of the most popular consoles of all time, this move was both a surprise yet also feels a bit late. That's because while Sony has dabbled with gaming displays in the past (remember that weird <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-07-sonys-24-inch-playstation-3d-display-first-hands-on.html\">Playstation 3D TV from 2011</a>), the company has largely refrained from expanding into the wider gaming hardware and accessories market \u2014 especially when it comes to PC peripherals.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"As part of Sony's new Inzone brand, the M9 is part of the company's first big push into PC gaming hardware. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/18880100-8170-11ed-baf7-a432f2bb0049\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, while Sony's line of  Inzone devices is made up of headphones and monitors that share a similar design with the Playstation 5 and a few exclusives features, it's important to note that the devices come from Sony Electronics (the company that makes TVs and wireless earbuds) and not Sony Interactive Entertainment (aka the Playstation people). That means you won't find any explicit Playstation logos, but what you do get is some of the fancy tech found on Sony's other premium gadgets like its flagship <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones</a>.</p><p>As for monitors, after testing it out earlier this year, I found the Inzone M9 to be one of the best 4K gaming displays for the money. Now going for just $799 (down from its $899 launch price), you get a 27-inch display with VRR and NVIDIA G-Sync support, DisplayHDR 600 certification and full array local dimming. I also appreciate some of the smaller touches Sony included such as a built-in KVM switch and surprisingly decent onboard stereo speakers, the latter of which makes it really easy to hook up a PC or a PS5 and just start gaming without worrying about audio.</p><figure><img alt=\"Unlike other monitors, HyperX's line of Armada gaming displays has ditched the traditional desktop stand in favor of an included monitor arm for a less cluttered and more adjustable setup. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/6b9fabe0-8170-11ed-97ff-b36442ee25c3\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, HyperX (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hp-buys-hyperx-144456046.html\">which is now owned by HP</a>) has also joined the fray this year with its line of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hyper-x-armada-25-hands-on-specs-price-release-no-stand-no-problem-101534103.html\">Armada gaming monitors</a>. Similar to Sony, HyperX's first batch of displays features a small twist on the standard formula because, instead of shipping with a traditional desktop stand, both of its new monitors are only available with a bundled monitor arm. And when combined with a 25-inch panel that offers a 1080p resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate for just $450 or a 2,560 x 1440 display with a 165Hz for $500 on the 27-inch model, what you get are some great mid-range displays, particularly for anyone looking to keep clutter to a minimum.</p><figure><img alt=\"Alienware 34 Curved QD-OLED gaming monitor\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/46a65370-cd61-11ec-b927-5462376515d1\" /><figcaption>Alienware's AW3423DW was the first QD OLED monitor on market when it went on sale earlier this spring. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another important milestone in 2022 was the release of the first batch of QD-OLED monitors, headlined by the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/alienware-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-ultrawide-review-140012704.html\">Alienware AW3423DW</a>. The really nice thing about QD-OLED displays is that they combine the super saturated colors and pure blacks you get with traditional OLED panels, but with much better brightness, not to mention less blooming and wider viewing angles (when compared to conventional LCD displays). When you factor in its huge ultra-wide format and 175Hz refresh rate, you get what's arguably the best overall gaming monitor on the market. And while Alienware was the first company to release a QD-OLED monitor, other companies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/msigaming/status/1595650709256810496?s=20&amp;t=hSbu056kBpiS2paTEZWtqA\">like MSI have their own rivals</a> coming soon.</p><figure><img alt=\"With a massive 55-inch 4K display, Samsung's Odyssey Ark is one of the biggest gaming monitors on the market. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/91f6ffb0-816f-11ed-91ff-d70eba47d0b7\" /><figcaption>With a massive 55-inch 4K display, Samsung's Odyssey Ark is one of the biggest gaming monitors available today. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Alternatively, for people who don't care about costs and just want the biggest and baddest gaming display on the market, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-ark-hands-on-specs-price-taking-gaming-monitors-to-a-whole-new-dimension-140056568.html\">Samsung's Odyssey Ark</a> was one of the most memorable gadgets I've used all year. With a massive 55-inch 4K panel and a 1000R curve, the Ark wraps around you like some kind of spaceship cockpit. And if that wasn't enough, you can even rotate it into portrait mode, which delivers one of the most unique gaming setups I've ever experienced. The downside is that while the Ark has four HDMI inputs and a special Multi View mode (which is basically a souped-up picture-in-picture feature), due to a limitation with HDMI, it can only display content from one external source at a time. But if you have$3,500 lying around and want the most jaw-dropping monitor that came out this year, the Odyssey Ark can't be beat.</p><p>I also recently had the chance to check out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-27gr95qe-us-pricing-availability-announced-181515149.html\">LG\u2019s latest UltraGear gaming monitors</a> with their new 240HZ displays, which is the highest refresh rate you can get from any OLED monitor on sale today. LG\u2019s new panels mean you can get both the deep blacks and vibrant colors OLED screens are known for <em>and</em> the kind of refresh rates that previously were only available from IPS displays. The downside though is that with a max brightness of just 200 nits, the new UltraGears aren\u2019t ideal for gaming in bright rooms.</p><figure><img alt=\"Not only does LG's latest 45-inch gaming monitor boast a super fast 240Hz display, it also features a very curvy 800R radius that delivers a cocoon-like experience. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/4a7afb00-816f-11ed-a94e-8356812dea64\" /><figcaption>Not only does LG's latest 45-inch gaming monitor boast a super fast 240Hz display, it also features a very curvy 800R radius that delivers a cocoon-like experience. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But as someone who\u2019s been waiting a long time for OLED panels to become more mainstream, it\u2019s really encouraging to see more products get added to the mix. That\u2019s because while there are a handful of OLED monitors out right now (like the aforementioned Alienware AW3423DW), pickings are still pretty slim. Some like the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvdHZzL2xnLW9sZWQ0MmMycHVhIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYzVmYzYyNi1iZGZjLTRlODctYTgxNi0wYzg5MzgyYjJkZDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaxJQEkTJRYrEHkoezYgDC01fILUyd168adcwOrE37UF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled42c2pua\">LG C2</a> are actually just TVs that are also being pushed as large-format desktop displays. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/above-34-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg42uq-model/\">ASUS' ROG Swift OLED line</a> uses the exact same panels LG uses in the C2, but with a few tweaks like a built-in heatsink and a DisplayPort 1.4 jack for improved gaming performance.</p><p>But perhaps the bigger issue is that, essentially, all the OLED monitors available right now are rather large. The smallest C2 and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BU1VTLVN3aWZ0LUdhbWluZy1Nb25pdG9yLVBHNDJVUS9kcC9CMEJCU1YxTEs1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWR3LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYzVmYzYyNi1iZGZjLTRlODctYTgxNi0wYzg5MzgyYjJkZDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe3n_-vW670Bj_zGDbP1bIi8RPRVoKm6qMegrbq1f9Os&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG42UQ%2Fdp%2FB0BBSV1LK5\">ROG Swift OLED</a> models measure 42 inches across, while the Alienware AW3423DW isn't much better with its 34-inch ultra-wide panel. But with LG's new UltraGear OLED, we're finally getting something in a more manageable size along with one of the highest refresh rates we've seen on an OLED monitor to date.</p><figure><img alt=\"Featuring an unusual 16:18 aspect ratio, LG's DualUp monitor is designed to provide additional vertical screen space without needing to rotate a display into portrait mode. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/d6674070-816e-11ed-93ef-80fd7a2808c7\" /><figcaption>Featuring an unusual 16:18 aspect ratio, LG's DualUp monitor is designed to provide additional vertical screen space without needing to rotate a display into portrait mode. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, for anyone who isn\u2019t a gamer, there were also some interesting new productivity displays that came out this year.

When combined with its included arm, you\u2019ll enjoy a setup that boasts a ton of vertical screen real estate without needing to stack multiple displays or having to deal with a screen that's too skinny when rotated into portrait mode. And, thanks to a color gamut that covers 98 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum, the DualUp can handle a lot more than just really tall spreadsheets. LG even included support for power output of up to 90-watts, so you can get video from a laptop and keep it charged all with a single USB-C cable.</p><p>Finally, while it still needs a bit of refinement, Corsair just released its huge 45-inch gaming monitor with a bendable display called the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3JzYWlyLmNvbS91cy9lbi94ZW5lb24tZmxleC1iZW5kYWJsZS11bHRyYS13aWRlLWdhbWluZy1kaXNwbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYzVmYzYyNi1iZGZjLTRlODctYTgxNi0wYzg5MzgyYjJkZDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYiW9qzn36os4ZUj745WwwCk-guIQS9j_OfbKoJu1TyG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fxeneon-flex-bendable-ultra-wide-gaming-display\">Xeneon Flex</a>. Now I know that the ability to manually transform a monitor from flat to curved might seems kind of silly (and it probably is, especially when gadgets like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-flex-flat-panel-curved-display-121941054.html\">LG OLED Flex exists</a> and features built-in motors), but it's nice to see more companies experiment with bendy screen tech. And who knows, maybe they can add a feature where the monitor goes into gaming mode when you bend it allowing your battle station to shift gears depending on the kind of work (or play) you're doing.</p><div id=\"36c174ba14fa479cbfe13e0b02ad3cab\"></div><p>Regardless, with more people working remotely than ever, it's nice to have more choices when it comes to kitting out your setup.

Wait, don't run away! While the series may evoke the worst of our COVID experience at first, it also transforms into a hopeful tale about the power of stories (and pop culture!) and human connection. It delivers something we could all use right now: Hope.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3>Tuca and Bertie Season 3</h3><p>After being unceremoniously canceled by Netflix in 2020, the cartoon duo of Tuca and Bertie found a new home on Cartoon Network last year. The third and (unfortunately) final season of the series aired this year, and it remains a delight. Created by Lisa Hanawalt and executive produced by Raphael Bob-Waksberg (<em>BoJack Horseman)</em>, it follows a pair of friends as they deal with life, love and simply existing in their '30s.</p><h3>Also on HBO Max:</h3><p><em>The White Lotus</em> (Season 2): Mike White's series on the exploits of privileged resort guests, this time in Sicily instead of Hawaii, remains a delight.</p><p><em>Harley Quinn </em>(Season 3): This show remains one of the best DC series currently airing.

Created by Tony Gilroy (who helped transform <em>Rogue One</em> into a stellar film), it centers on Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), a small-time thief with a healthy distrust for the Empire. The show follows his journey towards becoming a member of the rebels, and in doing so it also serves as a blueprint for taking down authoritarian systems.</p><h3>Fire of Love</h3><p>Katia and Maurice Krafft were a rare couple, two expert volcanologists who were also madly in love. They dedicated their lives to documenting active volcanoes, often by directly confronting lava flows, rock explosions and acid lakes. <em>Fire of Love</em> unearths their original footage to show just how far they went in the name of science. But it also paints a portrait of a truly rare couple, one whose contributions we still owe much to.</p><h3>Also on Disney+:</h3><p><em>Tales of the Jedi: </em>A short animated series that gives us a bit more backstory on Ahsoka Tano and... Count Dooku? If you've been interested in the <em>Star Wars</em> cartoons, but don't want to slog through tons of old episodes, this is a good start.</p><p><em>Bluey</em>: This remains the best kids show on TV.

You know, typical teenage stuff. Will his newfound power keep him on the wrong side of the law? And will he ever get revenge against the people who ruined his life? The show doesn't do much new, but it features genuinely compelling characters and some of the best animation in recent years.</p><h3>The Midnight Club</h3><p>Mike Flanagan can do no wrong. The talent behind <em>Midnight Mass</em>, <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, and the excellent \u201c<em>Haunting of\u2026\u201d </em>horror shows on Netflix has now set his sights on a Christopher Pike adaptation, and the results are glorious. The show, co-created by Leah Fong, follows a group of terminally ill teenagers as they tell spooky stories and explore the supernatural mysteries of their hospice mansion. It's a meditation on the power of storytelling, but also yet another Flanagan exploration of the value of life.</p><h3>Also on Netflix:</h3><p><em>Wednesday: </em>Come to see Tim Burton finally get his shot at The Addams Family, stay for Jenna Ortega's perfectly deadpan performance.</p><h2><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vd2VsY29tZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDcxNGYxYmEtMDA2MS00YTljLTk2NjYtMTBkOWU3MGFjZTIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAei3HyeokB_2Jabwq9oExnpfXKFtXc5G6ix4_bmA4aWv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwelcome\">Hulu</a></h2><div id=\"402dc862acc34aceb71460419bccff71\"></div><h3>The Bear</h3><p>Can an award-winning chef truly come back home and save his family's beleaguered sandwich shop? Or is he just trying to work through the death of his brother the only way he knows? <em>The Bear</em> captures the energy and madness of kitchen life better than any TV show \u2014 forget all the glossy stuff you've seen on <em>Chef's Table</em>. But amid the insanity, it's the story of a found family banding together to mourn and save the place they all love.</p><h3>The Dropout</h3><p>What makes Elizabeth Holmes tick? This series, which stars Amanda Seyfried as the notorious Theranos founder, paints a more complete picture of Holmes than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-09-the-inventor-hbo-theranos.html\">2019 HBO documentary <em>The Inventor</em></a>. We see Holmes' early life, as well as her initial connection with Sunny Balwani (Naveen Andrews, perhaps the best TV adaptation glow-up any South Asian man can hope for). After proving her smarts in college, she sets off to build the world's best blood testing machine with Theranos. We all know how that went. When the hype around Theranos starts to fall apart, <em>The Dropout</em> turns into a fascinating portrait of self-deception.</p><h3>Also on Hulu:</h3><p><em>Fleishman is in Trouble</em>: Toby Fleishman is going through a divorce.
