It was about a grumpy old widower who snaps at everyone on his street \u2013 officiously enforcing the Neighbourhood-Watch-type rules about parking and recycling \u2013 and keeps on trying to take his own life. These attempts are continually thwarted when he spots some local outside his house breaking some bylaw and Ove can\u2019t resist rushing out to remonstrate. But a nerdy, sweet-natured young couple move in next door and insist on befriending Ove, and their artless friendship relieves Ove\u2019s repressed sadness and affords him redemption. Ove was played in the original by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (Wallander on Swedish TV) and now by Tom Hanks \u2013 renamed Otto \u2013 in this Hollywood remake from screenwriter David Magee and director Marc Forster. The goofy-friendly new neighbours are played by Mariana Trevi\u00f1o and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo.</p><p>Hanks\u2019s performance amplifies and colourises the original curmudgeon, and his star-quality soups up the drama and makes a clearer sense of the backstory, yet the very fact of it being Hanks means that we never for a moment believe that he really is going to be that nasty (or that unhappy) for long. Soon, the lovable Hanks will surely reappear, and it duly does as the sad story of his late wife emerges in sucrose flashback \u2013 although she is always a bland cipher, not a convincing person. Finally, of course, Otto is going to be absolutely adorable. With his fierce short haircut and blank, open face he looks very familiar. Not grump, but Gump.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/28/a-man-called-otto-review-tom-hanks-goes-grumpy-in-remake-of-quirky-heartwarmer\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/29/i-would-love-to-teach-my-kids-to-appreciate-being-bored-because-these-days-i-never-am", "title": "I would love to teach my kids to appreciate being bored \u2013 because these days I never am | Adam Liaw", "date_published": "2022-12-28 14:00:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Call it a renouncement of hustle culture \u2013 I\u2019m over being too busy to take care of the things I value</p><p>Nobody move.

The Dutch golden age painter Gerard de Lairesse hired two sisters as models in his home town of Li\u00e8ge, but did a runner in 1664 after locals discovered that he\u2019d been having an affair with not one but both of them. And when there wasn\u2019t sex, the studio might witness the crazed infatuation of an artist like the Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka.

Across nearly 400 pages, A Writer\u2019s Diary charts the life of a man over the course of a year. Animated by the steady approach of two classic intersecting narrative themes, birth and death, the novel\u2019s architecture is relatively conventional, as its protagonist, a writer named Toby Litt, navigates the emotional impact of these two life events.</p><p>Litt comes across as a writer who shies away from demonstrativeness; his approach to letting deep feeling land is defined by a Chekhovian taciturnity that doesn\u2019t always emotionally engage the reader. However, his novel is not about these bedrock life events, not really, and the restraint with which he articulates them leaves space for a different exploration. At the level of narrative, the book documents a couple\u2019s journey towards parenthood, a vulnerable process after three previous miscarriages, contrasted with the narrator\u2019s slow loss of his mother to cancer. These simple, tectonic movements play out with a kind of tidal inevitability, but the surface of the book is preoccupied with something entirely different. Toby (the protagonist, rather than the author of the book) is given a diary by his partner for Christmas, and writes in it daily. Thus the novel chronicles the way huge life events are parsed out into days; their impact on a consciousness that remains quotidian, tied to routine, preoccupied with anxiety and pencil sharpening and work, even as it is swelled and rocked by life and death.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/28/a-writers-diary-by-toby-litt-review-birth-death-and-pencil-sharpenings\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/meme-negronis-olivia-cooke-emma-darcy", "title": "This year, of all years, we needed a delightfully pointless meme about negronis | Hannah Jane Parkinson", "date_published": "2022-12-28 09:00:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Who knew that a chat about drinks between actors Olivia Cooke and Emma D\u2019Arcy could be so sexy and comforting?</p><ul><li>What was the image on your phone that defined 2022?<br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/snapshot-of-2022\">Writers give their perspectives</a></li></ul><p>\u201cNegroni.

Years later, when they were both single, their messages to each other became gradually more flirty. But it wasn\u2019t until August 2021 that they discovered a deeper bond between them.</p><p>\u201cI was living in Las Vegas at the time and we started talking about past relationships,\u201d says Jonathan. They instantly felt connected by the challenges they had experienced in their personal lives and decided to swap numbers. \u201cI was on him like a rat up a drainpipe. I had fancied him for a few years,\u201d laughs Amanda.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/28/how-amanda-abbington-met-jonathan-goodwin-i-was-on-him-like-a-rat-up-a-drainpipe\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/uk-government-imprisoned-abroad-brothers-overseas", "title": "Our loved ones are imprisoned abroad.
