  <p id="JA3Nla">Waze is one of the preferred navigation apps for many due to its live community-driven traffic incident information — but what if the app warned you where a crash could <em>likely</em> occur? A new beta version of the Google-owned app, as <a href="https://www.geektime.co.il/waze-will-alert-you-about-roads-with-history-of-crashes/">reported by Israeli tech news site <em>Geektime</em></a>, can alert users about roads that have statistically high crash occurrences based on Waze community data.</p>
<p id="zIubm0">While using this new beta version of Waze, nearby roads deemed to be high-risk are colored red on the map. Although, <em>Geektime</em> points out that it may not do this for roads that the user often travels on.

  <p id="gJGLCe">Disney will be releasing a documentary about comic book titan Stan Lee in 2023, as an original title for its Disney Plus streaming service. In <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/stan-lee-documentary-coming-to-disney-in-2023">an announcement post</a>, the company said the news is being announced today because it would’ve been his 100th birthday (Lee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/12/18088554/stan-lee-death-obituary-marvel-comics">died in 2018 at the age of 95</a>).</p>
<p id="qzHJg9">Lee famously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17306950/marvel-avengers-infinity-war-stan-lee-cameo">had cameos in pretty much every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie</a>, some of which are shown in Disney’s announcement trailer. Of course, before the movies he was known as the person who helped write the stories they were based on; Disney’s post lists him as the co-creator of characters like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man, and the Avengers. </p>

  <p id="tns6EL">The US House of Representatives has ordered staff to delete TikTok from any House-issued mobile phones, according to an internal memo obtained by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiktok-banned-house-issued-mobile-devices-rcna63403"><em>NBC News</em></a>. The directive was reportedly issued by Catherine L Szpindor, the chief administrative officer of the House, and also bans the popular social media app from being downloaded on House-issued devices going forward.</p>
<p id="9SPFDy">The CAO’s Office of Cybersecurity believes TikTok to be a “high risk to users” due to a lack of transparency regarding how its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, handles customer data. “House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,” the memo said. “If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.”</p>

Whether you’re keeping track or not, this is the biggest price cut to date. Today’s deal is on the silver (more like off-white) color scheme only, which may be a disappointment if you prefer black.

  <p id="FRtbyS">A free Matter software update for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant">Aqara M2 smart home hub</a> has been delayed until January 2023. A <a href="https://www.homekitauthority.com/aqara-delays-public-matter-firmware-rollout-until-2023/">statement from an Aqara representative to <em>HomeKit Authority</em></a> claims that the maker of affordable smart home devices “needed more time to ensure the customer experience was right.” </p>
<p id="SpDryT">The update will make over 40 of Aqara’s existing Zigbee devices Matter compatible and was originally scheduled to roll out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23436897/aqara-matter-dates-update-hub-m3-thread">sometime in December 2022</a>. While the short delay may be disappointing, it may not be a bad thing — our own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513535/matter-smart-home-device-testing-eve-google-apple-samsung">early review of the Matter smart home network</a> saw mixed results regarding connectivity and setup, so a bit more time in the oven couldn’t hurt.</p>

<p id="Ih1GrR">In fact, tinkering is so encouraged that the Arduboy Mini doesn’t come with a speaker or a battery built-in. Instead, the gadget comes with clearly labeled solder contacts for both a battery and speaker located on the exposed rear of the device. Otherwise, the...</p>

  <p id="7dgQ1m">Old US military equipment being sold on eBay contained what appears to be biometric data from troops, known terrorists, and people who may have worked with American forces in Afghanistan and other countries in the Middle East, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/technology/for-sale-on-ebay-a-military-database-of-fingerprints-and-iris-scans.html">a report from <em>The New York Times</em></a>. The devices were purchased by a group of hackers, who found fingerprints, iris scans, peoples’ pictures, and descriptions, all unencrypted and protected by a “well-documented” default password. <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2022/afghanistan-biometrie">In a blog post</a>, the hackers called getting at the sensitive data “downright boring,” given how easy it was to read, copy, and analyze.</p>

  <p id="fNwFy3">Southwest Airlines has left thousands of travelers stranded at airports throughout the country after a winter storm barreled through most of the US before and during the holiday weekend. </p>
<p id="pxwgv6">While Southwest canceled over 2,600 of its flights on Tuesday, the trouble’s expected to extend well into this week, with <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today">data from Flight Aware</a> indicating that the airline has already called off more than 2,400 flights on Wednesday and over 1,500 on Thursday. Southwest canceled nearly 3,000 flights on Monday. Other airlines with notable flight cancellations didn’t even come close to Southwest’s total, as Spirit canceled 83 flights on Tuesday, while Alaska Airlines called off 75.</p>
