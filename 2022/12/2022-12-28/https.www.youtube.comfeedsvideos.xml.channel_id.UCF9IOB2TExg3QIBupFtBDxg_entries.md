Site as of 12st December 2022

Everyone, everywhere, should have access to COVID-19 vaccines. 

WHO is determined to maintain the momentum for increasing access to COVID-19 vaccines,

and will continue to support countries in accelerating vaccine delivery,

to save lives and prevent people from becoming seriously ill. 

Countries should continue to work towards vaccinating at least 70% of their populations

This represents a serious threat to the fragile economic recovery, 

including due to the risk of new variants creating large waves of serious disease,

and death in populations with low vaccination coverage.
