It appears we have to go over this with Whoopi Goldberg twice. Yes, twice. This is a new apology for a new faux pas. Not a recap of her apology from February.</p><p>But before we get to the new apology...here's a recap of her old one.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="0a3c4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32409400&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Goldberg said that the Holocaust wasn't about race. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoopi-holocaust-isnt-about-race" target="_blank">This shocked even the other yaks on "The View."</a>  Outrage and/or mockery ensued. Goldberg apologized, only to go on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoopi-goldberg-stephen-colbert" target="_self">Stephen Colbert and double down on her stupidity</a>. She then apologized again on "The View." ABC suspended her for two weeks. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoopi-goldberg-threatens-quit-view" target="_blank">She threatened to quit</a>. She didn't quit. Goldberg returned to the show to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoppi-goldberg-archbishop" target="_blank">say an assortment</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoopi-goldberg-hollywood-elitist" target="_blank">other stupid things</a> that had nothing to do with the Holocaust.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="17740" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32409412&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>That brings us to the new controversy, in which she became embroiled in after answering a question about the old controversy. Whoopi was interviewed by the <a href="https://www.bizpacreview.com/2022/12/28/whoopi-apologizes-again-after-repeating-remarks-about-the-holocaust-im-still-learning-a-lot-1320235/" target="_blank">Sunday Times of London</a> and had this to say:</p><blockquote>My best friend said, "Not for nothing is there no box on the census for the Jewish race. So that leads me to believe that we’re probably not a race ." </blockquote><p>(Yes she went with one of her best friend's is Jewish)</p><blockquote>It doesn’t change the fact that you could not tell a Jew on a street. You could find me. You couldn’t find them. That was the point I was making. But you would have thought that I’d taken a big old stinky dump on the table, butt naked.</blockquote><p>A new round of outrage, another statement from the ADL, and another #FireWhoopi trend later, <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/whoopi-goldberg-jews-race-holocaustadl-adl-1235207371/" target="_blank">whoever wrote the apology for her</a> had this to say:</p><blockquote>Recently while doing press in London, I was asked about my comments from earlier this year. I tried to convey to the reporter what I had said and why, and attempted to recount that time. It was never my intention to appear as if I was doubling down on hurtful comments, especially after talking with and hearing people like rabbis and old and new friends weighing in.</blockquote><p>As with the last controversy, don't expect much to happen to Goldberg. Progressive privilege.</p><p><p>

<p>It has to be said, shout out to CCTV footage. There hasn't been a more valuable MVP for content. I'll throw doorbell cameras in there too. If you are a device or a technology whose job it is to record surroundings, those of us in the blogging world owe you a debt of gratitude. </p><p>It also needs to be said, how big of a gang of p-p-p-p-pussies do you have to be to be five strong -- armed with a least baseball bat and a knife -- and get your ass whooped by a guy wear maroon underwear? Who was armed with nothing but the smallest guy in your gang. I wouldn't even arrest these dinkuses. I'd post unedited photos all around note saying if seen, don't call the police. You need only point and laugh unmercifully at them.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Kim Kardashian whines about being 'canceled' over Balenciaga sexually exploiting children

You know, the one with little girls holding bondage bears and a copy of a Supreme Court case about kiddie porn. Let's joggle your memory since early December feels like it was last December:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">the brand "Balenciaga" just did a uh..... interesting... photoshoot for their new products recently which included a very purposely poorly hidden court document about 'virtual child porn'<br /><br />normal stuff <a href="https://t.co/zjMN5WhZ0s">pic.twitter.com/zjMN5WhZ0s</a><br />— shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href="https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/1594532715126202368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Decent people thought this <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/balenciaga-cooper-kupp" target="_blank">was gross</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/balenciaga-talk-show-host" target="_blank">disgusting</a>. The New York Times thought you were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-times-balenciaga" target="_blank">a bunch of intolerant rubes who didn't understand high art</a>. Kim K., who works with Balenciaga, gave a milquetoast response that was clearly written by her PR team to appease all sides. ESPECIALLY the side she has a financial interest in.</p><p>People got mad at her anyway. She is now blaming cancel culture.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p>
<blockquote>Because I didn’t say, ‘F*ck you, Balenciaga,’ that’s it, people got mad at that. So, it’s like they’re mad if I don’t speak out...</blockquote><p>Quick side note. The same company that owns Balenciaga <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harry-styles-gucci" target="_blank">also owns Gucci</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Why does <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gucci?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gucci</a> have Harry Styles, a grown man posing with a child’s mattress and a pink teddy bear t shirt?

People were mad you didn't say "F*ck you Balenciaga."</p><p>Cancel culture is when people lose their livelihoods over a ten-year-old tweet or accidentally use the wrong pronoun. The anger over Balenciaga is the middle-American belief that sexually exploiting children is disgusting and gross.</p><p><p>

## Twitter loves the fact Chaya Raichik bears a striking resemblance to archnemesis Taylor Lorenz

So when I wrote about Chaya Raichik <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/libs-tiktok-tucker-desantis" target="_blank">revealing her face to the world,</a> I didn't catch this myself. You'll be surprised to know Chaya does not look like comic sans with two Egyptian symbols. Though she does look like tech blogger Taylor Lorenz.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p> Yes, THAT Taylor Lorenz. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wapo-tech-reporter-coma" target="_blank">The one once described</a> as less likable than "<em>a half-crippled, fat, balding, internet shitposter." </em></p><p>To recap, Chaya was an anonymous Twitter user sharing videos and minding her own business. The videos she shared caused her account to become popular, though it was clear she held an opposing viewpoint than the journalisming industry. Journalismers hate that and are of the belief you should not be allowed a platform if it's used to disagree with them. Taylor Lorenz, "Tay Tay" as she's known by people, lashed out. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taylor-lorenz-libs-tiktok" target="_blank">She wrote a hit piece doxxing Chaya to the world</a>.</p><p>In a colossal backfire, the journalisming caused Chaya to become more popular. Taylor was left looking like the girl who claims she hates drama, and that if you aren't there for her worst you don't deserve her at her best. SPOILER: Those girls never have a best.</p><p>Now that we know these two rivals look like identical cousins, Twitter is having a field day.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/SRQglAAxFv">pic.twitter.com/SRQglAAxFv</a><br />— Stephen L.

## Watch: Waffle House (again) descends into AEW-style brawl, employee blocks thrown chair with ninja-like reflexes

We don't get this kind of action in northeast dinners. More often than not, we're too drunk and focused on our cheese fries. But it's regional thing. I can see someone who lives in the Waffle House areas of America look north to places like New York City and be equally fascinated by how things like "laws" aren't enforced.</p><p>It wasn't very Christmasy this year in Georgia.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Waffle House brawl on Christmas. <a href="https://t.co/Bo8mMY085R">pic.twitter.com/Bo8mMY085R</a><br />— Everything Georgia (@GAFollowers) <a href="https://twitter.com/GAFollowers/status/1607495972027785217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There's a lot of chaotic, AEW-style action and the commentary is fantastic. I've narrowed Christmas Chaos down to three highlights. One is this poor woman who, in a fit of rage, tried to climb over the counter. She found out the hard way that, yes Virginia, gravity does in fact work. Then she discovered there is a Waffle House fighting style that all employees are black-belts in.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>You've no doubt seen the five-second highlight that's gone viral.

Like, she did the hand motions and anything. It's as if she knew the cameras were on her.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>At some point, customers need to learn not to test Waffle House employees. It's as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-tampa-viral" target="_blank">if they train for combat</a> as well as train in the science behind perfecting hashbrowns and omelets. The gods of content have yet to deliver a Waffle House incident where the employees <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-upside-down" target="_blank">have not come out on top as the heroes</a>.</p><p>Waffle House employees are built different. All other restaurant workers should bask in their glory. It's that simple.</p><p><p>

Unclear is if this is a new video or a resurfaced one working its way around Twitter. But you can clearly see a real person saying real words with his mouth.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Klaus Schwab : <br /><br />“our education initiative… we have Cisco… and practically all the big names… we will revolutionize education…we will retrain the teachers… we will put a new curriculum in place”<br /><br />… so that we can indoctrinate the children with our ideology at an early age… <a href="https://t.co/PPSMIA1d5m">pic.twitter.com/PPSMIA1d5m</a><br />— Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1607929430164516864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Klaus Schwab, a global lobbyist, unelected to anything, has his hands in "practically all the big" corporations to retrain teachers and put a new global education curriculum in place. He doesn't say the word "indoctrinate," but feel free to draw your own conclusions. Schwab's comments are so alarming that Elon Musk -- who for all the leftist attacks on billionaires, seems to be the only one NOT on their side -- was taken aback.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Uhh …<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1607933340023230468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Now, it's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of conspiracies when you have the internet in front of you. And WEF associates give us plenty to work on. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wef-engineering-gender-away" target="_blank">Engineering away gender</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/farmers-dutch-regulations" target="_blank">Making it impossible for farmers to grow food</a>. And my personal favorite? The CEO of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-misinformation" target="_blank">Joe Biden's favorite pharmaceutical company</a> bragging about a pill with a computer chip that alerts authorities when you've taken it. Quote, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-pill-computer-chip" target="_blank">imagine the compliance</a>."</p><p>Because it's so easy to go down that rabbit hole, it's important to take a step back and check yourself on occasion. So I ask you...is there anything about this video that doesn't make Klaus Schwab -- in a real video where this real man said real words -- sound like Cobra Commander hatching a plan for global domination? Because I can't think of anything right now.</p><p><p>
