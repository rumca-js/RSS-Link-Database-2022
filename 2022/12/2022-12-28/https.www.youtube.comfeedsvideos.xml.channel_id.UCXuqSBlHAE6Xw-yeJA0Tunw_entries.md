Colton's WiFi is just like his work ethic: it SUCKS! How can we solve this problem? Ethernet? Maybe, but why worry about running new cables when he's got plenty in his walls. MoCA and Powerline will get his house in order and get his internet running smoothly so he can once again become gainfully employed.
