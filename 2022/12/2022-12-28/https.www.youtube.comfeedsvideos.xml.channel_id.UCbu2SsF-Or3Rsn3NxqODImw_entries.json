We go through 10 of the biggest finds in chronological order players have discovered this year.\n\nDiscoveries include exploring outer space, transmuting materials, holding impossible to hold items, Bokoblins stealing your horse, breaking open metal chests, diving deep under water, and much more complex glitches based off of IST, or Inventory Slot Transfer. Inventory Slot Transfer initiated a sort of renaissance for Breath of the Wild players and players then discovered more sub glitches based off of it, such as playing the game after you completed the game called Blue Hyrule, Direct Inventory Corruption, and Weapon Modifier Corruption, creating custom weapons and modifiers with powerful special abilities.\n\n2022 was a major year for Breath of the Wild, and many players contributed to finding and sharing these amazing glitches. We're now just waiting to see what the sequel Tears of the Kingdom will bring to the table after a long 6 years in the oven. If you enjoy Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom content, make sure to stick around, as we continue to cover Zelda today and will bring you the latest when it drops. For everything else, keep it here on GameSpot.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:17 Space Exploration\n0:46 Item Transmutation\n1:23 Hold Prompt Storage\n2:02 Bokoblin Horse Stealing\n2:30 Metal Chest Breaking\n2:59 Scuba Link\n3:42 Inventory Slot Transfer\n4:51 Blue Hyrule\n5:26 Weapon Modifier Corruption\n6:26 Gerudo Disarm\n7:05 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH-gWxq4jt4", "date_published": "2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "14 Best Steam Deck Games To Play Right Now", "description": "Steam Decks are now readily available and like it or not, they\u2019re slowly transforming us all into PC gamers. So whether you\u2019ve had one for a while, just got yours during the holidays or won it during the Game Awards giveaway, here are 14 games that are a real treat to play on it.\n\nFirst up is the GameSpot game of the year\u2013the perfect 10\u2013Elden Ring. In the game you play as a lowly tarnished with the ultimate goal of seeking the shards of the Elden Ring and becoming the Elden Lord. On your journey you\u2019ll find hidden dungeons, rare loot, beautiful views, terrifying creatures and lots of tough enemies that will test your strength. Just try to keep your cool, a Steam Deck broken out of frustration is a bit more expensive to replace than a controller.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnother challenging game with monsters is Vampire Survivors, a top-down roguelite indie survival game that charmed its way onto tons of Top 10 lists in 2022. The premise is simple: you choose from a handful of unique survivors, kill monsters to collect gems that turn into experience points, level up to earn upgrades and last as long as you possibly can.\n\nIf those first two games weren't filled with enough swords and magic for you then check out Cult of the Lamb. In this game you play as a lamb saved from death by a mysterious entity, The One Who Waits. In return you must return to the land of the living, start a cult in their name and defeat the Bishops of the Old Faith. Seems like a fair trade right? And when you\u2019re not slaying heretics, you\u2019ll be gardening, decorating, cooking, getting married and playing dice, all while listening to a soundtrack filled with BANGERS.\u00a0\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is my favorite game of all time and it feels so at home on the Steam Deck (Sorry Switcher 3 fans). Though the game is now seven years old, it's still a benchmark in video game storytelling, especially when it comes to those incredible side quests. Exploring the world, meeting colorful characters, and slaying monsters makes any train ride or picnic so much more interesting.\u00a0\n\nSome might say that I\u2019ve left the best for last and to be honest, I wouldn\u2019t argue with those people. Powerwash Simulator is exactly what the name implies: a game about cleaning things with a power washer. The experience focuses on building up your own business in its career mode and completing dirty jobs across the town of Muckingham. There's no time limit or a nagging sensation to achieve a high score, just you, a filthy building, and complete freedom in how you want to finish the mission. Powerwash Sim was the drug that got to try a ton of other \u201csimulator\u201d games, like Lawn mowing Sim, and I love getting a little cleaning done everywhere I do with Steam Deck.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVKTpSRTIFk", "date_published": "2022-12-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
