<p>It took Alfie Haaland 181 games spread over a decade to score 18 Premier League goals – his son Erling has bested him after 14 appearances for Manchester City, not that his former Leeds defender father will mind too much.</p><p>Leeds had made City work hard for their chances but were rarely able to cope with the champions’ slick passing and movement.

Grealish enjoyed the goal more than Haaland after receiving plenty of Elland Road rancour throughout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/28/leeds-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US can often be cruel to its citizens, but the public library is a sanctuary and a vision of what our country might one day be</p><p>If you proposed it now, at any town council or city hall meeting, you would be laughed from the room. The concept is almost unthinkably indulgent, in our austere times: an institution, open for free to anyone, that sells no products, makes no money, is funded from public coffers, and is dedicated solely to the public interest, broadly defined. And it’s for <em>books</em>.</p><p>If the public library did not already exist as a pillar of local civic engagement in American towns and cities, there’s no way we would be able to create it. It seems like a relic of a bygone era of public optimism, a time when governments worked to value and edify their people, rather than punish and extract from them. In America, a country that can often be cruel to its citizens, the public library is a surprising kindness. It is institution that offers grace and sanctuary, and a vision of what our country might one day be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/usa-public-libraries">Continue reading...</a>

His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VbZE6YhjKk">video interview with Julian Shapiro-Barnum, host of web series Recess Therapy</a>, went viral, as his description of corn as “a big lump with knobs” and general enthusiasm for the vegetable racked up views around the world.</p><p>“What do you like about corn?” asks Shapiro-Barnum in the video, which was shot at Smorgasburg, a weekly food festival in Prospect Park, New York. “Ever since I was told that corn was real, it tasted good,” says a gap-toothed Tariq, seemingly bemused by the sheer existence of corn. “But when I tried it with butter, everything changed! … I can’t imagine a more beautiful thing!

## A Man Called Otto review – Tom Hanks goes grumpy in remake of quirky heartwarmer

<p>Neither the comedy nor the inherently lovable Hanks are dark enough to bring this remake of an odd Swedish redemption story to life</p><p>Seven years ago, a frankly peculiar, quirky dramedy-heartwarmer from Sweden appeared: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/29/a-man-called-ove-review-rolf-lassgard">A Man Called Ove</a>, based on the bestselling novel by Fredrik Backman. It was about a grumpy old widower who snaps at everyone on his street – officiously enforcing the Neighbourhood-Watch-type rules about parking and recycling – and keeps on trying to take his own life. These attempts are continually thwarted when he spots some local outside his house breaking some bylaw and Ove can’t resist rushing out to remonstrate. But a nerdy, sweet-natured young couple move in next door and insist on befriending Ove, and their artless friendship relieves Ove’s repressed sadness and affords him redemption. Ove was played in the original by Rolf Lassgård (Wallander on Swedish TV) and now by Tom Hanks – renamed Otto – in this Hollywood remake from screenwriter David Magee and director Marc Forster. The goofy-friendly new neighbours are played by Mariana Treviño and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo.</p><p>Hanks’s performance amplifies and colourises the original curmudgeon, and his star-quality soups up the drama and makes a clearer sense of the backstory, yet the very fact of it being Hanks means that we never for a moment believe that he really is going to be that nasty (or that unhappy) for long. Soon, the lovable Hanks will surely reappear, and it duly does as the sad story of his late wife emerges in sucrose flashback – although she is always a bland cipher, not a convincing person. Finally, of course, Otto is going to be absolutely adorable. With his fierce short haircut and blank, open face he looks very familiar. Not grump, but Gump.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/28/a-man-called-otto-review-tom-hanks-goes-grumpy-in-remake-of-quirky-heartwarmer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was 11 or 12 and absolutely delighted, riding it around town in my faux fur white coat and a pair of purple DMs</p><p>I have a relative who is famous – OK, infamous – for their terrible gift-giving. Now, I don’t think that being poor at presents discounts you from being considered a generous, kind, altruistic person. There are many people in this world, I’m sure, who make good meals, listen sympathetically and remember important dates, but when confronted with a range of gifts will<em> </em>scream, fill their knickers and dive headfirst into a skip, only to emerge two hours later with the collected chunks of your present that year. I’m almost certainly one of them. That doesn’t make us bad people. It just makes us a somewhat spicy addition to any big day.</p><p>One rather memorable Christmas, when I was a large and rather lumpy 10-year-old, this relative gave me a pair of white woollen tights in a size XS. They barely reached my knees. So what, I hear you say. And exactly. So what? Kids grow so fast these days. White is a very flattering and easy-to-wear colour. It’s actually quite nice to look as if you’ve wrapped both legs in a set of poorly fitting bandages and just needed somewhere in the middle to store your bricks. A low-hanging, white woollen gusset that almost cuts off the blood supply to your thighs is a nice present and a nice thought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/28/i-got-a-two-tone-purple-bike-pale-violet-and-aubergine-god-i-felt-cool-the-christmas-present-ill-never-forget">Continue reading...</a>

## The Artist’s Studio by James Hall review – lust, crime and creativity

<p>From Bernini to Bacon, the artist’s studio has long been a place of passion and tragedy, offering a unique glimpse into the creative mind</p><p>Like the boot room at Anfield, or the unremarkable Detroit house that became Motown Records’ hit factory, the artist’s studio is where the magic happens. But the strange alchemy that turns mark-making into a spellbinding work of art is only the half of it. Sometimes, there is sex in the studio, too. The Dutch golden age painter Gerard de Lairesse hired two sisters as models in his home town of Liège, but did a runner in 1664 after locals discovered that he’d been having an affair with not one but both of them. And when there wasn’t sex, the studio might witness the crazed infatuation of an artist like the Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. He commissioned a lifesize doll modelled on his ex, Anna Mahler, and made more than 80 paintings, drawings and photographs of it in his workroom.</p><p>There could also be violence and death in the studio. The sculptor Bernini swung a crowbar at his brother Luigi in their workplace at St Peter’s, Rome, cracking several ribs, after discovering that Luigi was sleeping with his mistress. The early art historian Vasari wrote of Michelangelo, “He was constantly flaying dead bodies, in order to study the secrets of anatomy.” He got through at least 30 cadavers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/28/the-artists-studio-by-james-hall-review-lust-and-creativity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wetland protection, fertiliser and ailing amphibians among issues likely to have global impact</p><p>What should people who care about conservation be paying attention to? Each year since 2009 scientists and conservationists from around the world have come together under the direction of researchers from the University of Cambridge to answer that question. Their goal is to “provide novel information that society and decision-makers may wish to consider in legislation, planning and actions that contribute to environmental sustainability and mitigating threats.”</p><p>This year’s group came up with 15 top issues that fall into four main categories: resource use, disturbance of organisms and habitats, technological innovations, and policy and law. Nearly half of the topics that bubbled to the top have a connection to the climate crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/28/top-conservation-issues-watch-out-for-2023-wetland-fertiliser-amphibians">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve been a vegan since I was a teenager – not for health or environmental reasons, but because animals are sentient beings. And I want to be honest about that</p><p>I don’t think I’ve ever made a new year resolution. But this year I’m going to stop telling people that I don’t eat meat. It’s not that I do eat meat – I don’t. The thing is, when I tell people that I don’t eat meat, I’m saying it to be polite. I use that form of words because I don’t want to offend people. So, from now on I’m going to be more honest. I’m just going to tell people that I don’t eat animals.</p><p>I was nine when I decided to stop eating animals. My twin sister and I were the only black children in school. I experienced racism in and out of the classroom, so in the playground I would often find myself sitting in a corner talking to the local cats. When the cats were away, I’d talk to the birds and the bees. Amazingly, I never met a racist animal. Some were nervous when they first approached me, some would make a few visits before they got close, but it never took long for us to make a connection. Then we would just hang out together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/28/benjamin-zephaniah-tell-people-i-dont-eat-animals-thing-ill-do-differently">Continue reading...</a>

## A Writer’s Diary by Toby Litt review – birth, death and pencil sharpenings

<p>This stimulating genre-blurring account of a year in the life of a writer asks how we weigh and value our days</p><p>Toby Litt’s latest novel, originally <a href="https://substack.com/profile/49767854-toby-litt" title="">published online via Substack</a>, is a hugely readable achievement. Across nearly 400 pages, A Writer’s Diary charts the life of a man over the course of a year. Animated by the steady approach of two classic intersecting narrative themes, birth and death, the novel’s architecture is relatively conventional, as its protagonist, a writer named Toby Litt, navigates the emotional impact of these two life events.</p><p>Litt comes across as a writer who shies away from demonstrativeness; his approach to letting deep feeling land is defined by a Chekhovian taciturnity that doesn’t always emotionally engage the reader. However, his novel is not about these bedrock life events, not really, and the restraint with which he articulates them leaves space for a different exploration. At the level of narrative, the book documents a couple’s journey towards parenthood, a vulnerable process after three previous miscarriages, contrasted with the narrator’s slow loss of his mother to cancer. These simple, tectonic movements play out with a kind of tidal inevitability, but the surface of the book is preoccupied with something entirely different. Toby (the protagonist, rather than the author of the book) is given a diary by his partner for Christmas, and writes in it daily. Thus the novel chronicles the way huge life events are parsed out into days; their impact on a consciousness that remains quotidian, tied to routine, preoccupied with anxiety and pencil sharpening and work, even as it is swelled and rocked by life and death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/28/a-writers-diary-by-toby-litt-review-birth-death-and-pencil-sharpenings">Continue reading...</a>

A typical course might consist of “curry of rabbit soup, open tart, syllabub, macaroni, pastry baskets, salmon trout, sole, vegetable pudding, muffin pudding, larded sweetbreads, raised giblet pie, a preserve of olives and a haunch of venison, and buttered lobster” all arranged around a centrepiece, such as the wonderfully named “bombarded veal”. Once everyone had taken what they wanted, these dishes would be removed and replaced by a different selection and then, in turn, by several desserts.</p><p>Readers of Purkiss’s new survey of English food, a weighty 560 pages packed with morsels of culinary history, may feel similarly bombarded with riches.

<ul><li>Alex Carey hits maiden Test century on day three</li><li>Rain ends play early with South Africa 15-1, trailing by 371</li></ul><p>Early on the third day of the Melbourne Test, despite their scorecard advantage, you wondered whether an Australian team that more resembled a medical ward could adequately function in the match. Instead, when they finally declared two sessions later, two batters with busted hands were the ones in the middle landing the punches. Moving to 575 for eight, Cameron Green ignored his fractured finger to face 171 balls for an unbeaten 51, while the blow Mitchell Starc’s finger took while fielding didn’t stop him carting a six in his 10 not out. Alex Carey had notched his first Test century to help build the lead to 386 runs, and South African captain Dean Elgar was caught behind for a duck before rain ended play at 15 for one.</p><p>The day had started in a rush for the visitors, already 197 runs behind but soon with hopes of limiting the damage after Anrich Nortje’s opening burst. First he smashed through Travis Head on 51, jagging the ball off the seam to hit Head’s back pad and deflect onto his stumps. David Warner returned, restored by a night’s rest after retiring with severe cramps on reaching 200 the evening before. He departed just as quickly, a Nortje yorker swinging into his ankle and again onto the stumps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/28/cricket-australia-defy-injuries-to-close-in-on-test-series-win-against-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scientists have begun to explore the ocean’s ‘middle light’ – the mesophotic zone, a lesser-known part of our seas – with new rebreathers</p><p>In between the sunlit shallows and the dark, deep ocean lies an inky realm where few people have ever been. Stretching from about 30 to 150 metres, the mesophotic zone (meaning “middle light”) is an awkward depth. It lies just beyond the reach of regular scuba divers and it’s usually what aquanauts inside multimillion-dollar submersibles merely glimpse as they plunge deeper.</p><p>However, a new generation of scientists is pushing the limits of diving to discover the secrets of this ecological zone. “There’s so much to see, and everything seems new,” says Erika Gress from James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. “It’s like a different world.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/28/ocean-middle-light-mesophotic-zone-rebreathers-scientists-explore">Continue reading...</a>

The film, directed by Tonya Lewis Lee and Paula Eiselt, examines the roots and manifestations of dire statistics through the advocacy journeys of two grieving families. Two Black mothers whose concerns were downplayed or dismissed, who died in New York hospitals months apart, who would be caring for their children if not for an extremely preventable combination of medical racism, financial pressure to perform C-sections and inadequate senses of urgency. I was crying within three minutes. The film, available to stream on Hulu, should be essential viewing as a window into the many factors underlying such devastating disparities, but also as a path forward. It shows what woman-centered, choice-driven maternal healthcare could look like in the US, and the families fighting for it after the unimaginable. <em>Adrian Horton</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/28/the-best-movies-of-2022-you-may-not-have-seen">Continue reading...</a>
