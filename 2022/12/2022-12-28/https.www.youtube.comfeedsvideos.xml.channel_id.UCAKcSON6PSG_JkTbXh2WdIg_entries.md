Oregon-based folk duo Fellow Pynins — comprising Dani Aubert and Ian George — released their latest album, Lady Mondegreen, in May of this year. They immediately followed that with a tour of the U.K. and Ireland. 

Now touring in the U.S., Fellow Pynins visited Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra in the studio to play songs and to talk about their unique way of recasting traditional folk songs decades, if not centuries, old. In so doing, Aubert and George also explain how they landed on the album’s title.

Watch and listen to the complete studio session above.
