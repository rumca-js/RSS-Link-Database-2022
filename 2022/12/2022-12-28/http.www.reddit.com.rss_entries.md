## AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.</p> <p>We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.</p> <p>When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.</p> <p>This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes. </p> <p>Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because <em>Christmas is only once a year</em> and she <em>just wants to live a little</em>. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.</p> <p>And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.</p> <p>And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless.

## AITA for expecting my bf to bring me to my appointment?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context: I (23F) and my boyfriend (23M) discovered we were pregnant 8 months ago. I was hesitant as I still feel young but we have been together for almost 7 years. We decided to keep our little baby and I’m so happy to be creating and able to bring life into the world. He promised me he’d be there for me every step of the way and take me to all appointments even if he wasn’t allowed in, get me any cravings, etc etc. So as for the reason I’m upset today, it’s my own fault that I don’t drive yes (extremely anxious about it) I’m here at an appointment by myself that I had to take Uber to. Last night my partner came home from an extremely long day after he got called out to the job. He’s been on call since Friday and has gone out a couple times, not any fault of his own but missed our ultrasound Friday because he was called out. </p> <p>I asked him last night if he was okay taking me to my appointment this morning as it was quite early, 9AM. He said sure he would take me and we also have other things to do. We went to bed just fine. This morning I came down with a coffee for him and let him know he was gonna have to wake up but I made a coffee. He kept rolling back over and ignoring me. I got a bit frustrated and said “babe! It’s not just because I want to go out it’s because I have an appointment I told you about last night!” And he shot back at me “wow! It’s like I’m on call when I’m not, holy fuck!” And after that I just went quiet and I feel really upset about it. I’m typing this as I sit alone at my appointment and he’s probably still at home sleeping. I understand he worked a long day yesterday but I just feel like I’m doing everything alone when he promised me at the beginning he wouldn’t let this happen.</p> <p>I know he’s going to be a good dad to our son but things like this really hurt me especially with my insane hormones.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nie mogę już tego wytrzymać. Po ostatnim ociepleniu się pogody w wielu miejscach w Polsce stopniał śnieg z chodników. Byłem u babci na święta, babcia mieszka w niewielkim mieście na starym osiedlu. Wyszliśmy z siostrą na spacer i muszę powiedzieć że czułem się jak na jebanym polu minowym. Najwyraźniej wszyscy właściciele czworonogów stwierdzili że jeżeli na chodniku zalega śnieg to niekwestionowanym prawem ich pieska jest wysranie się na samym środku przejścia. Czy tak trudno jest przewidzieć że gdy śnieg stopnieje gówno ukarze się jak jebana skamielina mamuta? Nie wszyscy mają psy i nie wszyscy lubią gówno na podeszwie butów. Ja nie wiem może niektórzy uważają że zapach gówna w przedpokoju idealnie sprawdzi się zamiast świeczki zapachowej i doda wigili świątecznej atmosfery. Jeszcze niech potem jakiś dzieciak się bawi na takim dywanie. Czym ci ludzie w ogóle karmią te psy jebaną xenną balance? Musiałem się wygadać bo już nie mogę, zamiast odpoczywać na świątecznym spacerze czuję się jak w jebanym wietnamie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jodixon"> /u/Jodixon </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/"> r/Polska </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/zx4rnj/rant_o_kupie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/zx4rnj/rant_o_kupie/">[comments]</a></span>

Ale wypada zachować jakieś środki ostrożności. Założyć maseczkę, kichać w zgięcie ręki itd. to tylko podstawy, niestety z obserwacji widzę, że dużo ludzi nic się nie nauczyło. Idę ulicą, ludzie prychają. </p> <p>Stoję w sklepie w kolejce, ludzie kaszlą. W komunikacji miejskiej to samo. Widok maseczki to rzadkość, tak samo jak kichanie w zgięcie łokcia. Po co minimalizować rozprzestrzenie się wirusów, lepiej prychać na lewo i prawo, na innych ludzi. </p> <p>W pracy to samo. Zakończenie roku to u mnie sajgon, gorący okres. Od wczoraj znajoma siedzi i kaszle przed siebie, na lewo, na prawo. Maseczki nie założy bo jej nie wygodnie, w łokieć nie kichnie, bo nie zdąży, do lekarza nie pójdzie, bo była w tym roku dwa razy na L4 i nie chce nadwyrężać, a pracy jest sporo. No i super, tylko przez nią dzisiaj już 2 osoby nie przyszły do pracy z 12 w dziale, a kolejne skarżą się, że źle się czują. Sam też nie czuję się najlepiej i już umówiłem się na wizytę do lekarza.

## AITA for throwing away the elf on the shelf and "ruining Christmas" for my kids after my husband's prank?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, this year was the first time we would try the &quot;elf on the shelf&quot; with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) Lucas. </p> <p>Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24. His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a &quot;kid of Christmas&quot;. So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left &quot;Santa Claus&quot; footsteps, ate a carrot and &quot;grass&quot; he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that. </p> <p>My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it. </p> <p>We bought the cute Elf. My kids named it &quot;Bob&quot;. Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it &quot;fly&quot; each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him. </p> <p>But my husband took seriously the &quot;Behave or Bob would be naughty&quot; part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed. </p> <p>Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me &quot;no idea&quot;. I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. &quot;Bob&quot; was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents. </p> <p>My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the &quot;magic&quot; with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hour_Astronomer2471"> /u/Hour_Astronomer2471 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/"> r/AmItheAsshole </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx49l5/aita_for_throwing_away_the_elf_on_the_shelf_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx49l5/aita_for_throwing_away_the_elf_on_the_shelf_and/">[comments]</a></span>

## AITA for asking my gf to wash my mug and getting upset when she wouldn't?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (29nb) live with my gf (25f). Some background: I'm pretty sure I'm autistic and sometime have difficulty expressing myself well, and I get flustered easily when I feel like I'm not being understood. </p> <p>A few days, I saw a video on tiktok that really resonated with me. It was of a woman asking her partner to wash a mug for her and explaining how acts of service are her love language and the washing of the mug would make her feel loved. I really related to this because I have a special mug that I like to use in the mornings, but I have executive dysfunction and don't wash it as often as I should because it's handwash-only. I realized that I would find it really meaningful if my gf did that for me. </p> <p>Yesterday, I finally worked up the courage to ask her. For some context, we'd already finished dinner and were relaxing in front of the TV. Since everything was calm it seemed like a good time to ask. Unfortunately, my gf seemed pretty annoyed. To her point, she is in charge of grocery shopping and cooking and makes us some great food. Dishes are usually my responsibility, but that is usually just stuff that can go in the dishwasher. The few pans and knives that my gf is fussy about hand washing are handled by her because there is absolutely nothing I hate more than hand washing dishes. I tried to explain to her that she could wash the mug when she washes her cookware without much extra effort, but she said that since I'm the only one who uses the mug and since I let it get a little crusty and gross sometimes it should be my responsibility. Also I could have asked her earlier while dishes were being done instead of asking her to stop watching the movie, get up from the couch, and go back to doing dishes.</p> <p>At that point I was feeling really flustered and embarrassed and couldn't cope with the situation, so I decided it would be best to step away. I ended up sleeping in the guest room and she's been really distant today and even went out to dinner with some friends without inviting me. I understand that I was asking her to do a chore, but I would have really appreciated her giving me a chance to at least explain my thinking.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RepublicOpposite8709"> /u/RepublicOpposite8709 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/"> r/AmItheAsshole </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx1e5r/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_wash_my_mug_and_getting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx1e5r/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_wash_my_mug_and_getting/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (29M) recently started a new job and report to &quot;Alice&quot; (30sF). I come from a conservative Christian background and while I don't have any issues with reporting to a female, I'd prefer not to be alone with anyone of the opposite gender. I am married and out of respect for my wife, she is the only adult woman I spend time alone with (outside of family, of course). Furthermore, I wouldn't want there to be any appearance of impropriety on the lady's behalf, especially at work. In Alice's case, she is unmarried and very friendly and I worry that someone might see her meeting with a man alone and assume she's being flirtatious.</p> <p>This issue has arisen recently because it's time for end of year performance reviews. Previously, I've managed to get Alice to hold our 1:1s in the work cafeteria so that there are others around. However, Alice is insisting that my performance review be conducted in her office with just the two of us. I told her that I was uncomfortable with this. She pressed a little to see if she had done something to make me uncomfortable, and I replied that she hadn't, but out of respect for my wife, I would not be alone in a room with her. She did not take this well and told me it was not negotiable. I told her that I would be willing to meet in her office if I could have a male HR rep sit in with me, and she told me that she would have to think about it. Today, I received this email:</p> <p>&quot;Hi [name],</p> <p>I'm following up on the discussion we had on Monday about your unwillingness to meet alone with me (or any female colleague). I want you to feel comfortable and respected at work, but I would like to make it clear that there are occasions where it will be necessary for us to speak privately. It is an expectation of this job that you will be able to meet with me, or any other female colleague, alone if the situation calls for it. All employees are expected to conduct themselves professionally, and I have some concerns about your assumption that a private meeting between a man and woman in the workplace would be inherently inappropriate or unprofessional. I hope that you have taken the opportunity to reflect on this since our conversation and will be willing revisit your position. I have set up a meeting tomorrow so that we can discuss this further. [HR rep] will be in attendance.</p> <p>-Alice&quot;</p> <p>I don't think I'm out of line here and I believe that my religion should be respected in the workplace, but Alice's email has me worried. So, Reddit, AITA?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting_Bass_301"> /u/Interesting_Bass_301 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/"> r/AmItheAsshole </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwx80i/aita_for_asking_to_meet_my_boss_in_public/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwx80i/aita_for_asking_to_meet_my_boss_in_public/">[comments]</a></span>
