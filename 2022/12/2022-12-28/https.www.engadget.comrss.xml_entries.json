Both have their downsides. The latter involves a lumbar puncture, an invasive and painful procedure that\u2019s more commonly known as a spinal tap. A doctor will insert a needle into the lower back to extract a sample of the patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid. A lab technician then tests the sample for signs of progressive nerve cell loss and excessive amyloid and tau protein accumulation. MRI scans are less invasive but they\u2019re often expensive and accessibility is an issue; not every community has access to the technology.</p><p>The next best tool for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a blood test. While some can detect abnormal tau protein counts, they\u2019re less effective at spotting the telltale signs of neurodegeneration. But that could soon change. This week, in the journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awac407/6960988?login=false\"><em><ins>Brain</ins></em></a>, a multinational team made up of researchers from Sweden, Italy, the UK and US detailed a new antibody-based blood test they recently developed. The new test can detect brain-derived tau proteins, which are specific to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Following a study of 600 patients, the team found their test could reliably distinguish the illness from other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Dr. Thomas Karikari, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and one of the co-authors of the study, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/28/scientists-develop-blood-test-for-alzheimers-disease\"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a> he hopes the breakthrough could help other researchers design better clinical trials for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cA blood test is cheaper, safer and easier to administer, and it can improve clinical confidence in diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s and selecting participants for clinical trial and disease monitoring,\u201d he said. There\u2019s more work to be done before the test makes its way to your local hospital. To start, the team needs to validate that it works for a wide variety of patients, including those who come from different ethnic backgrounds.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/researchers-develop-blood-test-detects-alzheimers-disease-224320271.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-28 22:43:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "A Stan Lee documentary will hit Disney+ next year", "description": "<p>Today is Stan Lee's 100th birthday and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel/\">Marvel</a> marked the occasion by <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/stan-lee-documentary-coming-to-disney-in-2023\">revealing</a> that a documentary about his life will hit <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NWQ4NWVmMy1mYWM5LTQxOGYtOTU3My00MThjZjE2MmNkMGMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2MTZkYTllNy0xNDdmLTQ3ZjktOGFmNy0xN2MwNjQ4MTk0NDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfusaWSPpasBSz1mFkcqAgTY8qe0s-1cl-G0YUM-x52h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\">Disney+</a> next year.

In 2022, watching the long-overinflated crypto bubble burst was like staring at a pimple being popped in slow motion: oddly and grossly satisfying. And though some of us were sad to see <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html\">Stadia go</a>, no one in the tech and gaming industries was surprised when Google sent it to the graveyard. More frustrating, though, were the debacles that unfolded this year with very real and sometimes dangerous repercussions for the most vulnerable communities. As we recap the worst things that happened in tech in 2022, let\u2019s hope that the year ahead brings more positive developments for us all.</p><h2>Twitter</h2><p>Even before Elon got his hands on Twitter, the service was being mis-handled by its leaders. As soon as Musk floated the idea of a $44 billion takeover earlier this year, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and the company\u2019s board seemingly jumped at the potential payday. Who cares if it\u2019s a singular social network, one of the few platforms for under-served communities to get their voices heard? Agrawal alone <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/29/twitter-executives-payouts-musk/\">reportedly received $57.4 million</a> from the sale. (Founder <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/tech/twitter-jack-dorsey-elon-musk/index.html\">Jack Dorsey ended up rolling over his investment in the site</a>, rather than nabbing a near $1 billion payout.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>And now we have Musk\u2019s Twitter, an increasingly toxic pit of the internet\u2019s worst, driven entirely by the richest man in the world\u2019s id. Advertisers are leaving in droves, and Twitter obsessives are making their way to whatever alternative they can find. Meanwhile, Musk is learning just how difficult running a social network is (what\u2019s that, you actually <em>need</em> content moderation?!). At this point, we can only hope Twitter will go the way of Tumblr: Mismanaged until it\u2019s sold at a fire sale price to someone who actually cares about the internet. \u2014<em> Devindra Hardawar, Senior editor.</em></p><div id=\"091c8a918d4f43e384d967a6b5e6f84f\"></div><h2>Crypto, FTX and everything related</h2><p>2022 saw the value of major cryptocurrencies fall by a significant margin, with billions of dollars being wiped off the industry in minutes. Major crypto companies saw that a winter was coming, and started running layoffs in the hope of staunching the flow. But that winter got turned into a blizzard when FTX collapsed, pulling the already downward trends even further south. The year also saw plenty of other crypto exchanges get hacked, or burn up quite spectacularly when things got hairy. It was only then that the air started pouring out of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s bubble, and we\u2019re living through the consequences of that right now.</p><p>An Aside: I studied company law and finance for two years, and while I\u2019d never pretend to be a high-minded finance type, even a cursory look at FTX should have aroused suspicion. The business was structured so opaquely that it seemed like an obvious ploy to mask something, be it amateurishness, or criminality. No company that drew in just $388 million in profit needed to be structured into 100 wholly-owned sub-businesses \u2013 only a megacorporation like Disney could possibly justify such a sprawling structure.</p><p>The other thing that FTX\u2019s collapse should remind us all is that, while the current banking system is hardly a paragon, it does it least<em> function</em>. The fact that FTX was allowed to hold so much money in a system run by a bunch of comparatively unqualified figures is ludicrous. Maybe there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t let a bunch of relatively young kids with little real-world experience in the banking world run major financial institutions.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of crypto currency exchange FTX, sits after his extradition from The Bahamas with his attorneys Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell at his arraignment hearing in Manhattan federal court in New York City, U.S., December 22, 2022 in this courtroom sketch.

But there\u2019s no proof, friends, that this is tied to crypto\u2019s usefulness in laundering cash for major criminal networks. None at all.</p><p>I do think, however, that what will really hammer the nail into crypto\u2019s coffin in 2023 is the recession, as people need to cut down on their luxuries to pay for the essentials. Sure, you could justify buying a Bored Ape as an \u201cinvestment\u201d when there were stimulus checks rolling around the economy.

But at times during its short life, it was <em>amazing</em>. During <em>Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s</em> unmitigated disaster of a launch, Google\u2019s cloud gaming platform was one of the best places to run the sprawling game with minimal problems. When many couldn\u2019t get the latest PlayStation or Xbox, Stadia was a way to play games with visual fidelity beyond the PS4 and Xbox One \u2013 as long as your internet connection could handle it.</p><p>The problem (and there are a few reasons why it struggled) was Stadia didn\u2019t have enough games to stay relevant. Exclusives were rare and there simply weren\u2019t as many games as the competition. Many of Stadia\u2019s titles were also far more expensive to buy compared to other online game stores \u2013 even when on sale. When the company closed its internal development studios last year, it was not a good sign.</p><p>Then, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-denies-stadia-shutdown-rumor-171548840.html\">a rumor gathered pace</a> in late July 2022 that Stadia was going to be shuttered by the end of the summer. It was never substantiated, but it was enough to send devoted Stadia gamers (and their communities in places like Reddit) into freefall. Perhaps this was because Google has a reputation for killing its darlings. (RIP Google Hangouts, Play Music, Cardboard, Reader and the rest). Or perhaps because it was completely plausible?</p><p>Google denied it. Well, for two months. Then, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html\">announced it was shuttering the service</a>, saying Stadia \"hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected.\u201d Which was\u2026 true. But it worked incredibly well. That\u2019s probably why this isn\u2019t where Google\u2019s game-streaming tech ends. Earlier this year, AT&amp;T offered a handful of games, including <em>Control</em>, to its customers through Google's Immersive Stream for Games \u2013 aka Stadia but not. Capcom used Stadia\u2019s technology to offer a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-demo-web-streaming-capcom-google-stadia-030057053.html\">web-based <em>Resident Evil: Village </em>demo</a> back in June, while Bungie reportedly used it to test out <em>Destiny 2</em> changes and improvements with staff before rolling it out to gamers.</p><p>Google is, mostly, doing the right thing and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/stadia-hardware-refunds-google-store-223002849.html\">reimbursing game and hardware purchases</a>. But that didn\u2019t include Stadia Pro subs \u2013 arguably what its most passionate supporters were using. Users will be able to play their game library until January 18, 2023.

Wade leaked, there was widespread panic. Amid disbelief, incredulity and outrage, people began to question if the tools they were using to track or avoid pregnancy would be used against them. Chief among the concerns was the reliability of period and cycle tracking apps. Were they collecting data that could be used to identify people who had terminated pregnancies? Would they hand that information over to anyone looking for it?</p><p>The Dobbs decision had a ripple effect when we went from scrutinizing the privacy policies of all cycle-tracking apps, to realizing that the overall digital privacy of every user was on a tenuous foundation. Lia Holland, campaigns and communications director for Fight for the Future, told Engadget in June that period-tracking apps were the \u201ccanary in the coal mine in terms of our data privacy.\u201d</p><p>We learned too, that tracking tools used by platforms like Facebook to serve personalized ads could also be used for insidious reasons. Anti-abortion groups, for example, kept tabs on people seeking abortion services using Facebook\u2019s advertising tools, despite Meta\u2019s rules against doing so. Those groups could also share the data with third-party anti-abortion marketing companies to target \u201cabortion-minded\u201d people with ads. Though Google announced its intention to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2023, this year the company had to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-delays-phaseout-of-third-party-cookies-from-chrome-192422591.html\">delay that to 2024</a> as it continues to test a feasible replacement that would protect consumer privacy while allowing marketers to serve targeted ads.</p><p>At the start of 2022, Google announced that it was trying out a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-topics-api-privacy-sandbox-third-party-cookie-replacement-130049935.html\">different tracking approach called Topics API</a>, instead of the FLoC method it had initially prioritized. In February, after years of testing, Google\u2019s proposal was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-privacy-sandbox-cookie-replacement-approved-by-uk-regulator-112527258.html\">accepted by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority</a>. Still, despite rolling out previews of its privacy sandbox on Chrome in March and Android in April, Google still needed to push back the disabling of third-party cookies in its browser another year.</p><p>The outlook on our digital privacy in general may be bleak, but there may be hope for improvement. With all the scrutiny this year, many popular period-tracking apps took clear stands and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/flo-period-tracker-app-anonymous-mode-212157123.html\">launched privacy-focused modes</a> or made it clear that they would not collect user data. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-responds-abortion-data-privacy-legal-authorities-030247915.html\">FTC has also warned</a> companies and data brokers against the misuse of health and location data, and said it was \u201ccommitted to using the full scope of its legal authorities\u201d to safeguard consumer privacy.  \u2014<em> Cherlynn Low, Deputy editor</em></p><figure><img alt=\"Lifestyle image of the Peloton Row\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-09/54cbd9d0-38c2-11ed-bba5-f111fba92384\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Peloton</div></figure><h2>Peloton and home fitness tech (everyone went back to the gym)</h2><p>We\u2019ve all been cooped up at home long enough and in 2022, we all let the dogs (and ourselves) out. And as we all ventured outside, we stopped using the at-home gear we bought to tide ourselves over during the dark days of lockdown. Every time we came home to the sight of the expensive console or the exorbitant stationary bike we no longer used, we were reminded of sadder times or unfulfilled goals.</p><p>So while companies like Peloton and Bowflex saw a huge boost in sales during the lockdown, they quickly saw numbers stagnate or plummet in 2022. After an ambitious effort to manufacture its own equipment, this year the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-will-no-longer-make-its-own-connected-fitness-products-141307048.html\">gave up making its own products</a> and struck a deal to start selling its machines on Amazon. That marked the first time Peloton had sold its products on a platform other than its own, signaling that the company needed help to move units.</p><p>Since then, it\u2019s also launched a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-tread-guide-dicks-sporting-goods-142604284.html\">partnership with sporting goods retailer Dicks</a> to sell the Bike, Tread and Guide at 100 brick-and-mortar stores in the US. It also launched a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-rentals-co-founders-leaving-154513024.html\">rental program</a> to let people get the Bike for a monthly fee and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-software-strategy-shift-report-193224496.html\">CEO Barry McCarthy said</a> it was contemplating opening its workout content to competing bikes and treadmills.</p><p>These efforts to reach a wider audience makes sense. Peloton <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-earnings-loss-sales-subscriptions-144715841.html\">posted a net loss of $757.1 million</a> for the first three months of the year on a revenue of $964 million. The company tried drastic cost-cutting measures, including laying off about 2,800 corporate employees, which is equivalent to 20 percent of its total workforce. It laid off an additional <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-tread-price-increase-layoffs-stores-outsourcing-173804988.html\">570</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-tread-price-increase-layoffs-stores-outsourcing-173804988.html\">784</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-layoffs-fourth-round-173007412.html\">500</a> workers in July, August and October, effectively halving its workforce in a year. It also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-price-changes-subscription-bike-plus-tread-161051108.html\">cut the prices of existing models</a> in an effort to lower the barrier to entry and draw in more new customers.</p><p>It\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Peloton, though. The company did launch <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-row-ergometer-rowing-machine-connected-110014923.html\">a new rowing machine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peloton-guide-camera-hands-on-153057753.html\">connected camera</a> this year, and appears to be setting its sights on more markets around the world. <em>&nbsp;</em>\u2014<em> C.L.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"2023 Toyota bZ4X all-electric SUV is displayed during the 2021 LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November, 17, 2021.

(There was a RAV4 EV, once upon a time.) And it\u2019s doubly disappointing after we\u2019ve learned that the company has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/\">lobbying to slow down the EV transition</a>.

Toyota is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-toyota-scrambles-ev-reboot-with-eye-tesla-2022-10-24/\">pushing to reboot its sluggish EV plans</a>, and given its sheer size it\u2019ll likely catch up to other EV companies within the next decade.</p><p>But the company\u2019s image is tarnished.

Call us cynical, but in recent years, the list of losers gets longer, while we struggle to find true winners to write about. But in 2022, there were bright spots that brought light to a gloomy, chaotic 12 months. From beautifully simple word games to enchanting pictures from space, there were just enough distractions this year to balance out the neverending drama from Twitter, Meta, Amazon and the like. These are the Engadget team\u2019s favorite things in 2022.</p><h2>NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope and DART projects</h2><p>In 2022, things on Earth were so bad that we all welcomed the opportunity to look at what\u2019s beyond our galaxy. After its launch on Christmas last year, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) deployed its sunshield in January, finished calibration a few months later and started sending back images. On July 11th, President Biden revealed the space agency\u2019s first picture to the public, saying it was the sharpest and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-223020435.html\">deepest image of the distant universe</a> to date.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>More photos were released <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-first-color-images-152109471.html\">on July 12th</a>, and throughout the rest of the year, we saw more and more of deep space through the JWST. The colorized pictures made for stunning wallpapers, but also brought us tantalizing information about distant planets. In August, it detected carbon dioxide in a faraway planet\u2019s atmosphere. To date, we\u2019ve also seen images of the Cartwheel Galaxy, Phantom Galaxy and the Pillars of Creation in unprecedented detail. The visual spectacle is a welcome distraction, but the data gained also helps scientists learn a ton more about what exists beyond the Milky Way.</p><div id=\"74a1b41a09f84b209801c09fb4fce497\"></div><p>NASA also scored a reassuring win with its Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project this year, when it managed to crash its spacecraft into an asteroid, changing its course. This success has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson/status/1579899660684382208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1579899660684382208%7Ctwgr%5E10ec715b5ae331451bc526b4fc51edff5b1ba555%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fnasa-dart-mission-smashing-success-184543626.html\">billed as a \u201cwatershed moment for planetary defense\u201d</a> by NASA administrator Bill Nelson, adding that the agency \u201chas proven we are serious as a defender of the planet.\u201d The fact that DART was able to knock an asteroid off its course showed that it could work to save the Earth if a space rock were headed for our world and was small enough and detected in time. It\u2019s nice to have some hope for humanity in that specific situation, as we continue to be dazzled by everything we learn about the vast expanse of space that we float in. \u2014<em> Cherlynn Low, Deputy editor.</em></p><h2>Wordle, Josh Wardle and all the -dles</h2><p>Do you remember a time when you weren\u2019t obsessively playing guessing games on your phone right after waking up? That was probably in 2021, before Wordle, the little browser game that could, swallowed most of the internet for the first half of 2022. Josh Wardle, a British software engineer, created a word game for his partner, letting them guess a five letter word through a process of trial and error. He didn\u2019t publicize the title, but it didn\u2019t take long after its October 2021 launch before everyone was playing the game.</p><p>Part of Wordle\u2019s success was due to the simplicity of its mechanic, pulled from the \u201870s board game <em>MasterMind</em> or the \u201880s game show <em>Lingo</em>. Your guesses provoke a color-coded response: A blank box if you struck out, a yellow one if you had the right letter in the wrong place and green in a space that you got right. The other reason for its success was how simply it visualized your guesses, making it easy to share on social media without spoilers. Suddenly, everyone on Twitter was humblebragging about their lexicographical skill posting a short-ish grid of gray, yellow and green squares.</p><p>The fact that only one word came out each day also meant that you had to keep coming back to get your daily fix. It easily slid into your morning routine, as a way of waking your brain up before, during or after, your wake-up beverage of choice.</p><figure><img alt=\"Wordle app game is seen on a smartphone in front of The New York Times logo in this picture illustration, February 1, 2022.

Wordle also enabled a cottage industry of websites that can help you solve tricky words, and most SEO-chasing newspapers offer a written clue about what today\u2019s Wordle actually is.</p><p>Wordle\u2019s success was so grand that it wasn\u2019t long before a deep-pocketed news organization looking to grow its traffic offered to buy the game wholesale.

The concept may have been knocking around for a while, but Wardle was able to see the fruits of his work pretty quickly. Since then, the NYT has launched Wordlebot, a microsite which\u2019ll analyze your game and tell you the most efficient starter words (CRANE/SLOTH), and it even has its <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNy9jcm9zc3dvcmRzL3dvcmRsZS1lZGl0b3IuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODQ1Njc0YzctN2E3MS00ZmRjLWI3ZWItYTlkM2EzMGQwOTNhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATwRKYk7jGEPRJ0iw7EIftV77kEP5lOj4VK7VW6KPd5M&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F11%2F07%2Fcrosswords%2Fwordle-editor.html\">own named editor</a>, so you know who to blame if you have a bad day.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just Wardle who benefited.

Last year it was the Pixel 5a (well, the Pixel 4a, because Google didn\u2019t launch the 5a here in the UK), and now it\u2019s supplanted by the even-more premium-looking Pixel 6a.</p><p>The new design is glossy, with the distinctive camera bar that arrived on the flagship Pixel 6 phones last year, ensuring it looks different to all other smartphones. This year, the Pixel 6a also has Google\u2019s homemade Tensor chip, which was built to help with AI and image processing. I might not even need to say this, but the Pixel 6a, like its predecessors, has an incredibly capable camera for the price. It includes Google tricks like Face Unblur to salvage dodgy shots and Magic Eraser for scrubbing out any unwanted elements. The Pixel 6a also has a 6.1-inch display, down from the 6.34-inch screen of last year\u2019s Pixel 5a. So if you\u2019re looking for a more pocketable Android, this might be the best option.</p><p>The Pixel 6a launched at $449, sneaking in under $500. On some occasions (like Black Friday), it\u2019s already been on sale at $300, which is an incredible bargain \u2013 especially if you\u2019re still using a smartphone that lacks 5G. The only reason for not buying it in early 2023 is that we\u2019re already hearing rumors of the Pixel 7a, which should be an even better phone. \u2014<em> Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"Steam Deck review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/6a74eb00-95b1-11ec-ab2f-df115a618661\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2>Valve Steam Deck</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a> isn\u2019t the first handheld computer and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. However, by combining the convenience of the Nintendo Switch with the flexibility of a PC and a huge library of supported games (there are now almost 7,000 titles listed as verified or playable), Valve has almost single-handedly reinvigorated the market for portable PC gaming. And with a starting price of just $400, the Steam Deck also costs hundreds less compared to rivals from Ayaneo, GPD and more.</p><p>Granted, the Steam Deck isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s rather bulky as far as handhelds go and Valve\u2019s Linux-based SteamOS often requires a bit of tinkering with to optimize a game\u2019s performance. I wish its high-pitched fan was a bit less distracting, too. But thanks to its clever touchpads and general customizability, the Steam Deck makes it easier to play traditional keyboard and mouse games while on the go than pretty much anything else out there. For people who love Nintendo\u2019s games, the Switch is great. But for everyone else, the Steam Deck might be the best multipurpose gaming handheld you can buy right now.  \u2014<em> Sam Rutherford, Senior writer.</em></p><section><img alt=\"The Apple Watch Ultra with alpine loop strap on a person's wrist.

As a reporter covering smartwatches, I\u2019ve been holding my breath for this year\u2019s trio of highly anticipated wearables from Apple, Samsung and Google. The first two were expected to unveil souped up \u201cPro\u201d models of their flagship models, while Google was set to launch its first \u201chomemade\u201d smartwatch, featuring Fitbit integrations. Between the blandness of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review-battery-life-specs-durability-180052187.html\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html\">overall letdown of the Pixel Watch</a>, there wasn\u2019t a lot of competition for Apple\u2019s Watch Ultra.</p><p>But the company didn\u2019t just coast on the mediocrity of the Android smartwatch market. The Watch Ultra features a 49mm screen in a highly durable case that doesn\u2019t feel excessively huge (unless you\u2019re a fellow petite-wristed person). Apple made a selection of carefully crafted straps that are eye-catching, comfortable and easy to maneuver with gloves. The Watch Ultra also boasts a depth gauge for divers, dual-frequency GPS for more-accurate distance tracking, an emergency siren and impressive four-day battery life. All that is on top of other Apple Watch features like comprehensive health and fitness tracking, seamless messaging and excellent iPhone integration.</p><p>And for the cherry on top of it all \u2014 and this is my selfish reason for loving the Apple Watch Ultra \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html\">reviewing this device allowed me to go on a hike</a> on the job, all in the name of real-world testing. Sure, I have since swapped out the Watch Ultra for a Series 8 as my daily driver, but Apple managed to pack enough features into its prosumer smartwatch to set it apart from its mainstream flagship. \u2014<em> C.L.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"Discord and Twitter app icons are seen in this illustration taken November 7, 2022.

But no other service has benefitted more than Mastodon, the once relatively-obscure site that\u2019s long billed itself as a Twitter alternative.</p><p>Ironically, Mastodon first became prominent back in 2017 after a backlash against Twitter\u2019s decision to remove user handles from character limits (it\u2019s difficult to remember now, but there was a time when these kinds of changes would temporarily spark mass outrage among the Twitter faithful).</p><p>Since then, the decentralized platform has had a small contingent of dedicated users, but was nowhere close to the social media mainstream. That all changed as soon as Musk\u2019s takeover began. Almost overnight, more than 30,000 new users <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternative-mastodon-open-source-021001965.html\">flooded</a> the platform, and the growth has only intensified since Musk formally took control of Twitter in October. As of November, Mastodon had more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1594121627083493378\">2 million</a> users seeking a new home outside of Twitter.</p><p>While that may still be tiny by social media standards, it\u2019s notable that the nonprofit, open-source site is already the preferred alternative for a number of journalists, celebrities and other one-time Twitter power users. Yes, the platform is more complicated than Twitter, and not everyone is eager to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html\">start over</a> on a new site. But it\u2019s impossible to ignore just how good Mastodon\u2019s timing has been. In the span of a few months, it\u2019s gone from niche to mainstream, and for now seems best-poised to absorb the masses fleeing Twitter. \u2014<em> Karissa Bell, Senior editor</em>.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/biggest-winners-in-tech-2022-170054480.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-28 17:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "How to take a screenshot on any device", "description": "<p>It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve all asked ourselves at some point in time: <em>How do I take a screenshot on this thing? </em>There\u2019s a good reason for that, as knowing exactly how to capture that funny text, strange email or high score is eternally useful.

You can copy captures to a connected USB drive from the Media Gallery as well, which may be the most convenient option if you\u2019re looking to send a batch of screenshots and videos to a computer.</p><p>It\u2019s also possible to make the PS5 automatically send screenshots to your phone. First, you have to download the PlayStation app on iOS or Android and link it to your PS5 console. In the app, go to the Game Library tab, hit the Captures toggle at the top, then tap Enable. Then, on the PS5, go to Settings &gt; Captures and Broadcasts &gt; Captures and ensure Auto-Upload is activated. Any captures you manually take on your PS5 will now go straight to the app \u2013 but photos will only stay there for 14 days, and video clips must be less than three minutes long.</p><h2>How to take a screenshot on an Xbox Series X/S</h2><figure><img alt=\"A photo of the Xbox Series X/S controller, with the Share button highlighted.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/58346ab0-7b25-11ed-9ebf-f87888411bdf\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Aaron Souppouris / Engadget</div></figure><p>To take a screenshot on an Xbox Series X/S, simply tap the Share button on your controller while playing a game. To take a video recording, press and hold the Share button. (It will capture the last 30 seconds of gameplay by default.) If you double-tap the Share button, meanwhile, you\u2019ll bring up a list of your recent screenshots and video clips.</p><p>If you\u2019re using an older Xbox One gamepad without a dedicated Share button, press the Xbox logo button on your controller while playing a game to bring up the <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/getting-started-set-up/using-the-guide\">Xbox guide</a> menu, then press Y to capture a screenshot or X to record your last 30 seconds of gameplay. If you want to record a longer stretch of gameplay, hit the View button (the one with two rectangles) and select the duration you want. You can still use the guide to capture screenshots and videos with a Series X/S controller, though naturally it\u2019ll be slower than just hitting a button.</p><figure><img alt=\"A capture of the various screenshot shortcuts available on an Xbox Series X/S.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/067a2260-7b24-11ed-86ff-94e09dd19118\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>This guide menu allows you to record upcoming gameplay as well. For that, press the Xbox logo button on your controller, go to the Capture &amp; share tab on the right side of the guide, then select Start recording. (If you want, you can also take a screenshot or record recent gameplay from here, too.) To end the recording, open the guide back up with the Xbox logo button, then press the X button. Note that your recordings and screenshots will start and stop from the moment you press the Xbox logo button, not when you press Y or X afterwards.</p><p>In any event, you\u2019ll see a notification appear once you\u2019ve taken your screenshot or video clip. If you hold the Xbox logo button on your controller while this banner is on-screen, you\u2019ll open up the Share menu. This lets you quickly share the capture to your Xbox activity feed or an <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/friends-social-activity/share-socialize/join-club\">Xbox club</a>, attach it to a message, post it directly to Twitter, or send it to your OneDrive account. You can trim video clips, set a capture as a background or delete it from here as well.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the Share menu for screenshots on an Xbox Series X/S.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f0581690-7b23-11ed-9bd7-ebff121087c2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you download the Xbox mobile app and link it to your account, you can also use the Share menu to send screenshots and video clips straight to your phone. Just select Mobile. Once the capture hits your phone, you\u2019ll see quick links for easily sharing or downloading it right from the Xbox app. To see all of your Xbox screenshots and video recordings in the app, go to the My Library tab \u2013 the one with the icon that looks like three books \u2013 then select Captures.</p><p>If you just want to keep playing, know that you can access these screenshot management options at any time. Just hit the Xbox logo button, move to the Capture &amp; share tab, then select Share last capture or Recent captures, selecting a screenshot or video to share and/or edit from there. As noted above, you can also double-tap the Share button on an Series X/S controller to open the Recent captures menu.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the Capture &amp; share menu on an Xbox Series X/S.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/996d6ab0-7b23-11ed-baf7-b75b6ab7216b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Microsoft</div></figure><p>It\u2019s possible to change the default length of video recordings in your Xbox\u2019s settings. You can get there by selecting the gear icon at the top right of the home screen. Alternatively, you can hit the Xbox logo button, move to the Profile &amp; system tab \u2013 it\u2019s on the right in the guide menu \u2013 then select Settings in the middle of the menu. Then, go to Preferences &gt; Capture &amp; share &gt; Record what happened, then select whatever duration you prefer.</p><p>The Capture &amp; share menu is also where you can, among other options, turn off automatic uploading of screenshots to the Xbox network. Be aware that Xbox screenshots must be uploaded to the network in order to be shared in the first place, so if you deactivate this setting, you\u2019ll have to manually upload any individual screenshot or video you want to share going forward. Still, this can save you from seeing a bunch of pop-up notifications while playing.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the Button mapping menu on an Xbox Series X/S.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c4127850-7b23-11ed-bffe-bc431725d158\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Microsoft</div></figure><p>To see all of the screenshots and video clips on your Xbox console, go to the Captures app. To get there, double-tap the Share button to get to the Recent captures menu, then select Show all at the bottom. Or, press the Xbox logo button, then select My games &amp; apps &gt; See all &gt; Apps &gt; Captures. (It\u2019ll look like a gamepad in front of a film strip.) Either way, once you\u2019re there, hover over a capture and hit the Menu button on your controller (the one with three horizontal lines) to access options for sharing, deleting, copying to external storage, uploading to OneDrive, etc. You can also select Manage at the top to more easily delete or upload captures in bulk.</p><p>To customize how the Share button behaves, use the Xbox Accessories app. You can get to this by selecting Button mapping in the Capture &amp; share menu, or by going back to the Apps menu and selecting the app icon with a joystick on it. If you do the latter, select your controller, then select the pen icon to edit your profile. Now you can make it so double-tapping the Share button starts and stops a recording, to give one example.</p><h2>Using third-party tools to capture and share screenshots</h2><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the ShareX app on Windows 11.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/0aa1b130-7b12-11ed-9f9e-270711a5154b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">ShareX</div></figure><p>For the most part, it\u2019s straightforward enough to share your screenshots directly from the built-in tools on most platforms. That said, it\u2019s worth remembering that there are third-party alternatives on some OSes that can make the process a bit easier.</p><p><a href=\"https://getsharex.com/\">ShareX</a>, for example, is worth a shout. It\u2019s a free and open-source program with all the screen capture options as Windows\u2019 Snipping Tool, plus a range of after-capture editing tools. Notably, it also allows you to directly upload (and delete) captures to image hosting services like Imgur (with easily shareable URLs), apps like Twitter and Google Photos, cloud storage lockers like Dropbox and more. You can make it so captures automatically go to these destinations, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/capture\">Dropbox Capture</a>, meanwhile, puts quick options for taking screenshots, video recordings and audio recordings in your taskbar, then lets you copy (either as an image or URL) and/or download your captures for easy sharing right from there. There are plenty more options beyond that, so if you find yourself needing a little extra power, you aren\u2019t necessarily limited \u2013 though, as always, you should exercise caution with lesser-known services that may carry <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lightshot-chrome-screenshot-app\">privacy risks</a>.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device-163053556.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-28 16:30:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best apps on Android and iOS to download on your new smartphone", "description": "<p>Whether you just got your hands on a new phone or want to give your current device a makeover, the easiest way to make the most of your smartphone is to try out new apps.

If you\u2019ve never used one before, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">Bitwarden</a>. It won\u2019t wow you with beautifully designed apps, but you\u2019ll appreciate its fair business model. The best part of the Bitwarden experience is that all of its core features are free to use. Without paying a cent, you can use Bitwarden on as many devices as you want. By comparison, LastPass charges <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-free-one-device-type-limitation-161122381.html\">$3 per month</a> for that same functionality.

Partway through last year, Mozilla <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/firefox-for-android-update-080007893.html\">overhauled the Android version</a> of its browser to bring over many of its best desktop features to mobile. That release saw Mozilla add more robust support for third-party add-ons. It also brought over its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature, which stops trackers from misusing your browsing data. Separately, with Apple allowing you to change your default browser since the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-ios-14-130014162.html\">release of iOS 14</a>, there's never been a better time for iPhone users to liberate themselves from Safari.</p><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img alt=\"Headspace\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Headspace</div></figure><p>I subscribed to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e3494264-16cf-476b-92a8-2dfe2c12bfa0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Headspace&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlMzQ5NDI2NC0xNmNmLTQ3NmItOTJhOC0yZGZlMmMxMmJmYTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGVhZHNwYWNlLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFlOTliZmFkLTI1MjgtNDkxNC05MmNhLTM0YWU5NmUzZjcwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUB81IwF-h2-nemQklBZwb3WiMnD0dEgO8Y_2tblCigl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.headspace.com%2F\">Headspace</a> at the start of the pandemic. Since then, it's become one of the few apps I use every day. Yes, Headspace is a meditation and mindfulness app, but it's also so much more than that. You'll find it also has a mix of music designed to help you focus and workouts for unwinding at the end of a long day. Across the board, everything it offers is excellent, and you'll find yourself turning to it for more than just peace of mind.</p><h2>Notion</h2><figure><img alt=\"Notion\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/286199c0-7af3-11ed-87ee-365c783084fc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Notion</div></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> is one of the most powerful productivity tools you can download right now, and if your goal for 2023 is to organize your personal and professional lives, I can\u2019t recommend it enough. What makes Notion so powerful is an interface that looks simple but offers a lot of flexibility. I\u2019ve used Notion to create to-do lists, write notes and features and manage personal projects.

At its core, it allows you to download recipes from your favorite websites and make them accessible on all your devices. You can also use it to scale the size of the meal you're about to cook and convert between metric and imperial measurements. Add to that a meal planner, shopping lists and a tool for tracking the ingredients in your pantry, and you have an indispensable app for home cooks.</p><h2>Pocket Casts</h2><figure><img alt=\"Pocket Casts app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d991c6b0-5e8a-11ec-b69f-401c90e23326\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Pocket Casts</div></figure><p>With podcasts becoming ever more popular with each passing year, there's a good chance you already have a handful of favorite shows you listen to every week. As much as Spotify would like to convince you it has the best podcast app, that distinction goes to <a href=\"https://pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a>. We like it because it offers a consistently great experience across every system it supports. And if you use a mix of platforms from Apple, Google and Microsoft, you don't have to worry about syncing, either. It\u2019s also nice to use software that doesn\u2019t feel caught between two worlds in the way that Spotify does. Pocket Casts isn\u2019t trying to be anything more than an app for listening to podcasts. That\u2019s not something you can say of Spotify, and it\u2019s often a source of frustration for those who turn to it for music.</p><h2>Pocket</h2><figure><img alt=\"Pocket app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e72ebb20-5e8a-11ec-bbbd-79f45195740b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Pocket</div></figure><p>Another way to read more in 2022 is to download <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/en/\">Pocket</a>. It's among the most popular read-it-later apps out there, allowing you to save articles you find online. Much like Pocket Casts, what makes this app compelling is that it offers a consistently excellent device-agnostic experience, making it a great option for those who haven't gone all-in on one ecosystem. Whether you use Chrome, Safari or Edge, you can install a browser extension to save articles you stumble upon. You can then read them later without distractions on your phone or tablet. Just don't forget to make a dent in your Pocket reading list occasionally.</p><h2>Signal</h2><figure><img alt=\"Signal\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/a831c8f0-7af3-11ed-beef-921dc52ddb63\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Signal</div></figure><p>We understand, asking your friends and family to install another messaging app on their phone can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task, but the effort has also never been more worth it. In <a href=\"https://signal.org/en/\">Signal</a>, you'll find one of the most secure chat apps on the market. It has all the features you would expect from a messaging program, including support for stickers and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/signal-stories-release-095559625.html\">Snapchat-like Stories</a>, but more important are the ways Signal is different from rivals like WhatsApp and Telegram. Signal is a nonprofit and is one of the few apps committed to privacy rather than revenue via data collection. That means you won\u2019t see any ads in the app, nor will the company sell your data to third-party marketers.</p><h2>Tunnelbear</h2><figure><img alt=\"Tunnelbear for Android\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/fbcd8330-c5df-11ea-9f7b-2d20663edfe1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tunnelbear</div></figure><p>After a Password manager, one of the best tools you can use to safeguard your online privacy is a VPN.

A VPN isn't as essential as a password manager, but you'll want to get one if you frequently find yourself traveling or using the public WiFi at places like cafes and libraries. Using a VPN in those contexts will ensure your connection is protected with encryption so that any information you send over remains safe and private.</p><h2>Snapseed</h2><figure><img alt=\"Snapseed\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/465381b0-5f46-11ec-b3ff-47f3a4374f8c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Snapseed</div></figure><p>Most recent phones come with great cameras.

There was an easy solution too: The US military could have eliminated the risk by simply removing or destroying the memory cards before selling them.</p><p>\u2013 Mat Smith</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-razzmatazz-review-tiny-delightful-pink-drum-machine-140013901.html\"><ins>Razzmatazz review: A delightful (and delightfully pink) drum machine</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-oled-accessories-150048703.html\"><ins>The best accessories for Nintendo\u2019s Switch OLED</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-sc9-se6-soundbar-dolby-atmos-ces-2023-010041269.html\"><ins>LG's 2023 soundbars offer Dolby Atmos and wireless TV connections </ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uplift-standing-desk-irl-163028001.html\"><ins>What we bought: The standing desk I chose after a lot of research</ins></a></p></li></ul><h3></h3><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-proletariat-union-campaign-174226986.html\">A third Blizzard studio pushes to unionize</a></h2><h3>The campaign involves all non-management workers.</h3><h3></h3><p>Workers at Proletariat, a Boston-based studio Blizzard bought earlier this year, announced they recently filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

While we\u2019re not getting a close-up look at all the dials and buttons yet, the appliances look restrained compared to previous years\u2019 models. In the past, we\u2019ve seen a washing machine whose flagship feature was an entire extra washing machine. There was also a dryer that had two doors. Just <em>because</em>. LG says it\u2019s used recycled materials across multiple machine parts, adding that its latest appliances also require fewer total parts and less energy than typical kitchen appliances. This would dovetail with the company\u2019s announcements at the start of the year, where LG said it would offer upgradability for its home appliances. So far, that\u2019s included new filters for certain use cases and software upgrades with new washing programs for laundry machines.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-minimalistic-appliances-ces-2023-123506739.html https://www.engadget.com/...\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-house-of-representatives-bans-tik-tok-070722060.html\">US House of Representatives bans TikTok on its devices</a></h2><h3>Lawmakers and staff members who have TikTok on their phones would have to delete it.</h3><h3></h3><p>TikTok is now banned on any device owned and managed by the US House of Representatives, according to <em>Reuters</em>.

The company's LG Innotek arm just unveiled a periscope-style true optical zoom camera module with a 4-9 times telephoto range. Most smartphone cameras use hybrid zoom setups that combine certain zoom ranges (typically 2x, 3x, 10x, etc.) with a digital zoom to fill in between those (2.5x, 4.5x, etc.), leading to reduced detail. LG's &quot;Optical Zoom Camera,&quot; however, contains a zoom actuator with movable components, like a mirrorless or DSLR camera. That would help retain full image quality through the entire zoom range, while potentially reducing the size and number of modules required. Could this mean the death of the camera bump?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-teases-true-optical-telephoto-zoom-phone-camera-module-with-no-bump-133518178.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-biometric-devices-with-military-data-were-being-sold-on-e-bay-121545608.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-28 12:15:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony's WH-1000XM5 ANC headphones fall to a new all-time low of $279", "description": "<p>Sony's WH-1000XM5 is a highly desirable set of wireless headphones, thanks to improved sound quality, a comfortable fit and incredible active noise cancellation (ANC).

Perhaps the biggest improvement was in fit and comfort thanks to the more optimal weight distribution, synthetic leather ear cups and slightly reduced weight.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Sound quality also went up, due to the new 30mm carbon fiber drivers that deliver punchier bass. We also saw more clarity that helps you hear fine detail, along with improved depth that makes music more immersive. And Sony's DSEE Extreme sound processing recovers detail lost to compression, without any noticeable impact on sound quality.</p><p>The ANC is equally impressive. With double the number of noise cancellation microphones found in the M4, along with a new dedicated V1 chip, the M5 does a better job at minimizing background noise. And in terms of the microphone, we found that the M5 offers superior call quality over its predecessor. Moreover, you get 30 hours of listening time with ANC enabled, enough for the longest of flights.&nbsp;</p><p>The main drawback of the WH-1000XM5 headphones is the $400 price tag, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlYU0RNVDRGP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZTYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY4NDJjODJmLWZmODgtNDNkOC04NDA3LTJiM2M4M2QyNGRlYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATp2cNkflTSOLgFHS94PdDm6dInlAAp1aXqX5JKE8Ca2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09XSDMT4F%3Fth%3D1\">but at $279</a>, they're a stellar deal \u2014 as long as you're good with the white color.

A spokesperson for the Chief Administrative Officer told <em>Reuters</em> that after its passage, the CAO worked with the Committee on House Administration to implement a similar policy for the House.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That came after the Senate unanimously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-senate-approves-bill-ban-tiktok-government-devices-075852696.html\">voted to approve</a> the No TikTok on Government Devices Act that was introduced by Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri). As <em>Reuters</em> notes, 19 states had also banned or at least partially prohibited the app's installation and use on staff devices they own or manage. When the omnibus passed, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told Engadget that the company is \"disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices,\" calling it \"a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests.\"</p><p>TikTok's critics in the US government have been raising concerns that it could be used as a tool to spy on the US by Chinese officials. FBI Director Chris Wray called it a \"Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party\" and said that it has no place on government devices until it completely cuts ties with China. TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, tried to address those concerns by routing all domestic traffic through Oracle servers in the US and pledging to delete all US user data from its servers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the recent revelation that ByteDance <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-employees-us-user-data-journalists-210339650.html\">fired</a> four employees for inappropriately obtaining the data of TikTok users in the US, including that of two reporters, probably doesn't help the company's cause.
