As December progressed, we gradually saw clearly why the Chinese Communist Party CCP had suddenly lifted the stringent zero-Covid policy that had been in place for the past three years. Namely, by the time former Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin was announced dead on November 30, a massive outbreak had already struck, at least in Beijing. Infections and deaths couldn’t be contained by any means. If the zero-covid policy continued, it would have given the world clear evidence that the Communist Party's stringent control measures were virtually useless against the pandemic.

Exports are one of the main drivers of China's economic growth. Lower exports are bound to affect foreign trade and the Chinese economy.
