Now that the game\u2019s next gen update is out, it\u2019s like we\u2019re living 2015 all over again, as this new version of the game seems just as problem laden. \n\nFortunately, it seems as if you\u2019re playing the update on console, like myself, you\u2019re for the most part in the clear, although I have had some minor visual bugs like texture pop in and issues around the photo mode. But on PC, it\u2019s a different story, wobbly framerates, strange HUD glitches, and outright crashes, affecting even those with the beefiest of rigs.\n\nFortunately on PC, it\u2019s relatively easy to rollback to the previous version of the game. If you\u2019re on Steam, all you need to do is right click on the game in your library, click on properties, then Betas, and select the classic beta branch. Some redditors suggest turning off some optional settings such as ray-tracing, before rolling back to see if that helps, specifically with framerate hitches.\n\nCD Projekt Red has officially stated that it is aware of the issues, that it is actively looking into them, and will be putting out another update as soon as possible.\n\nLike I said, if you\u2019re playing on a console like the PlayStation 5, you should have a relatively bug free experience, but in case you want to give the game some time in an abundance of caution, new games are being added to PS Plus\u2019 Extra and Premium tiers to keep you busy.\n\nAfter taking a year off, WWE\u2019s 2K franchise returned in 2022 in mostly fighting form, with WWE 2K22, reemerging with a strong foundation and an overhauled gameplay system. However, PlayStation is slightly cheating calling this a December edition, as unlike the rest of the lineup that will be added to the two bonus ties of PS Plus on December 20, WWE 2K22 won\u2019t be available there until January 3 2023.\n\nOn December 20, fans of the Far Cry franchise are in for a treat, as both Far Crys 5, Primal, and New Dawn will be coming to the service, as well as RGG Studios games Yakuza: Likea Dragon, Judgement, and Yakuza 6. \n\nRemember, these games are a part of PlayStation Plus\u2019 Extra and Premium tiers. December games for its base Essential tier, which are available now, include Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, Biomutant, and Divine Knockout. Head to GameSpot dot com for the full list of Extra and Premium titles  \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to play on PC, Epic Games has announced that its seminal arena shooter Unreal Tournament 3 is being rebranded as Unreal Tournament 3 X and will be releasing as a free to play shooter on platforms like Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GoG, with crosssave and play.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQuAZ_64S8M", "date_published": "2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Review", "description": "The Witcher 3\u2019s latest update brings the modern classic to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S with an impressive suite of enhancements.\n\n#gaming#gamespot #witcher3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cphaOP6S5Qk", "date_published": "2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Check out an action packed gameplay trailer for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty!
