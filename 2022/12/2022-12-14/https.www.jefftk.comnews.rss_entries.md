Our house is now back up to full occupancy, which meant some things
that had been hanging out in unused rooms needed better homes.  Four
of those things were </span>

chairs</a>, and now they are up and out of the way:

I made this out of three pieces of scrap wood: two bits of 2x6 and a 1

hole for the dowel drilled:

The outer 2x6 is screwed to the inner one, and the inner one is
screwed through the wall into a stud.  The dowel stays in the hole by
friction: it's a close fit and it's not going anywhere.  This works
for these particular chairs because they have a nice round hole in the
seat back; other chair designs would likely need two pegs.

There are chair-hanging products you can buy, but I didn't like any of
them and this was a quick project I could do with things I had left
over from earlier projects.
