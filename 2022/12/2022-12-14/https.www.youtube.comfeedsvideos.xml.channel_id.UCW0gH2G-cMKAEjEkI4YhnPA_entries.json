She carried a full-sized sword, which measured nearly three feet in length, from tip to hilt. The bronze guard and pommel were styled beautifully in honor of the mearas, to improve the grip of Eowyn's small hand upon the sword. The handgrip was crafted with a raised middle section of three bronze rings. A wide fuller groove runs down 3/4 of the blade to reduce the weight, yet still retain critical blade strength. This type of fuller was common among royal swords of the Rohirrim. Against her uncle's wishes, a disguised Eowyn rode with the Rohirrim to the Pelennor Fields along with the hobbit, Merry, in defense of their fallen king. Eowyn achieved true heroism as she succeeded in the slaying of the Witch King and his fell steed; however, she also suffered a heinous injury during the crusade. After being healed by King Elessar, Eowyn finally abandoned her passion for battlefield grandeur and found true love in the arms of Faramir. The officially licensed reproduction sword is constructed with a 30 1/8\" tempered 420 J2 stainless steel blade. The handle features a solid metal guard and pommel with an antiqued, brass-plated finish. The hilt is cast with the symbols of the famed horses of Rohan and the grip is wrapped in genuine leather. Included are a parchment certificate of authenticity and a premium 11\" x 10 5/8\" x 3/4\" wood display plaque. The fantasy replica sword is 36 1/2\" in overall length.\n\nWhile this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#eowyn #lordoftherings #unboxing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWoTyNMLZUE", "date_published": "2022-12-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
