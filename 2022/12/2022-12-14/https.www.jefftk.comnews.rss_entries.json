Four\nof those things were </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/terje-folding-chair-black-00222440/\">folding\nchairs</a>, and now they are up and out of the way:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chair-hanger-complete-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chair-hanger-complete.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI made this out of three pieces of scrap wood: two bits of 2x6 and a 1\n1/4 dowel.  Here are the 2x6s, painted and screwed together, with the\nhole for the dowel drilled:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chair-hanger-in-progress-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chair-hanger-in-progress.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe outer 2x6 is screwed to the inner one, and the inner one is\nscrewed through the wall into a stud.  The dowel stays in the hole by\nfriction: it's a close fit and it's not going anywhere.  This works\nfor these particular chairs because they have a nice round hole in the\nseat back; other chair designs would likely need two pegs.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are chair-hanging products you can buy, but I didn't like any of\nthem and this was a quick project I could do with things I had left\nover from earlier projects.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0cgpJ38csvPnP5Y4P45YWtMKzCJhbG95nPR4hDqa86ccJCUGQpSTdAffwk4uWtop7l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/EEQiXKJbueNhe4sgb\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109512744144093505\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/chair-hanging-peg", "date_published": "2022-12-14 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
