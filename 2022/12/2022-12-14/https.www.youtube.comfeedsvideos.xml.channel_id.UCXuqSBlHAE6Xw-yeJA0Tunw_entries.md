We've had bendable phones for a few years now, but flexible monitors and TVs have remained unobtainable until now. The Corsair Xeneon Flex is a 240Hz ultrawide OLED monitor, and while it's expensive, it offers a pretty cool trick that we didn't know we wanted until we tried it.

## HOLY $H!T - The FASTEST CPU on the Planet - AMD EPYC 9654

Thanks to Supermicro for sponsoring this video! Check out Supermicro's H13 System Portfolio, powered by AMD EPYC™ 9004 Series Processors, at https://geni.us/q3l95Jp

Fun Fact: In a 2-socket server, you need 4 threads pegged at 100% to get 1% CPU utilization.

AMD's new SP5 socket, and HUGE new Epyc Genoa CPUs are crazy! Using Supermicro's servers, we set a bunch of World Records on a bunch of benchmarks. Intel is gonna be sweating, unless their upcoming Sapphire Rapids platform can magically compete. Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs might win against Ryzen in the mainstream, it's a whole different story in the datacenter.
