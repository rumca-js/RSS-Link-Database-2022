But I'm at a loss here other than to say...this is how they do in the UK. In America, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-feds-twitter-seven" target="_blank">our government works around free speech</a>...but we still have it kinda. In England, they don't. And a woman can get arrested for SILENTLY praying where she wasn't supposed to. Good guess if you said it was probably outside an abortion clinic.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">To clarify, the woman was charged with four counts of failing to comply with a Public Space Protection Order.<br /><br />The PSPO creates a zone around a specific facility to protect women from harassment by any means if they are seeking a medical procedure or advice at an abortion clinic.<br />— West Midlands Police (@WMPolice) <a href="https://twitter.com/WMPolice/status/1605173534803644416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>A "public space protection order" is similar to what we have in America. The pro-abortion lobby gives pro-abortion politicians millions of dollars. Those politicians find ways to make it illegal for citizens to peacefully protest outside of abortion clinics. If you want to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pro-abortion-activist-voice-mails" target="_blank">firebomb a Christian women's center</a>, that's "illegal" in the same way shoplifting in California is "illegal." But don't you dare stand within x amount of yards outside of where they vacuum babies out of women holding a poster board.</p><p>But this woman wasn't even holding a sign. She was standing in silence. Police took photographs of her standing in silence, then confronted her with those photographs asking if she was in fact praying.</p><blockquote>When shown pictures of herself outside the abortion facility by police, Vaughan-Spruce was questioned as to whether she was praying in the photos. She said she could not answer – some of the time she had spent praying, other times she had been distracted and thought about other things, such as her lunch. She maintains that both of these thoughts were equally peaceful and imperceptible and that neither should be criminalised.  </blockquote><p>So, yeah...I got nothing. Other than there are pro-abortion leftists in this country who will read this story and say "you're damn right she should be arrested!" Those people need to never be allowed power in America EVER.</p><p><p>

## Watch: XXXL-sized Packers fan gets thrown down a flight of stairs, but it only makes him mad

That's why this video is two drunks getting into a fight at a football game and not Exhibit D in an investigation. I'm also <em>assuming</em> alcohol was involved. It was the upper deck. It was a football game. I have fulfilled my legal obligations. Draw your own conclusions.</p><p>Unclear is what caused the fight. Tons o' Fun is the only Packers fan in what appears to be a sea of Bears fans. My guess is Tons reminded Bears Nation how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-chicago-cancel-culture" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers owns every one of their asses</a>. The Bears Superfan (B.S. for short) clapped back that Rodgers should be in prison jail. And that's all it took.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Stadium nearly collapses after massive Packers fan takes a lil dive <a href="https://t.co/GwnhE3zXx7">pic.twitter.com/GwnhE3zXx7</a><br />— Let Ryan Poles Eat (@POLESPLSEAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/POLESPLSEAT/status/1604854264337256449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Tons o' Fun didn't put up much of a fight. Few big fat loudmouths can. B.S. -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-stooge-moped-floor" target="_blank">no doubt mumbling something about mandates and The Science</a> -- locked up and attempted to wrestle him to the ground. That's a lot of cheese curds to put down on an elevated surface at such a high altitude.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="103bb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32370473&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>So he threw Tons down the stairs. It is but through the Grace of God that no one was walking up the stairs at the time. They would have been launched out of the way like they were bowling pins as the world's largest ball of fried foods came barrelling down. His pants didn't survive the fall either. That's what makes this embarrassing.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c81e4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32370474&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>To everyone's surprise, Tons got right back up. He was angry before. Now he's pissed! No one throws him down the stairs like that. If I attempted to murder someone by throwing them down a flight of stairs and instead saw them walking back towards me with THIS look on their face...let's say B.S. was lucky he was wearing his brown pants.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a6cb2" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32370475&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>By the time Tons made it back to his assailant, his anger subsided. He looks like he laughed it off. Or he emasculated B.S. by telling him "your tackling is just like the Bears defensive line...MID!"  </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="11fc2" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32370481&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Then they bought each other a beer and all was forgiven. Hey, it's a football game! These things happen. Sometimes you yell. Sometimes you fight. Sometimes you test gravity and the structural integrity of the 400 section. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Santa Claus and his elves confront drug dealer on naughty list, breakdown his door with a sledgehammer

The rest of the year, Santa's got his ear to the streets. He's cutting deals with sources and working over snitches. Finally getting that one big drug bust he's been working so hard for. That day finally came for one Peruvian Santa. I never knew I wanted to see St. Nick crack open a door with a sledgehammer before.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🇵🇪 Des policiers habillés en Père Noël et en elfe arrêtent un trafiquant de drogue présumé au cours d'une opération dans la capitale péruvienne Lima <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AFP</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y4yap1YxBj">pic.twitter.com/Y4yap1YxBj</a><br />— Agence France-Presse (@afpfr) <a href="https://twitter.com/afpfr/status/1339511152443674624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>This video needs a Beastie Boys remix...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Because everything is better with music...<a href="https://t.co/uPblWsPnM1">https://t.co/uPblWsPnM1</a> <a href="https://t.co/w4YkK5CP7W">pic.twitter.com/w4YkK5CP7W</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1605186758844588032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>For the sake of "accuracy" and playing nice with Facebook's "fact" "checkers," <a href="https://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2020/12/17/watch-peruvian-santa-puts-drug-dealer-on-the-naughty-list/" target="_blank">this Santa was a cop</a>. This now makes the second "undercover Santa" story <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-claus-car-thief" target="_blank">we've read about this week</a>. Which opens up any number of questions. Is working the undercover Christmas beat a regular thing cops do? Is it considered a promotion or a demotion? And did the cop stuck being an elf lose a bet? Inquiring minds and all that.<br /></p><p>What confuses me in this video is, last time it took place outside the mall the first cop Santa worked at. This looks like it takes place in a skid row somewhere. I can't imagine "Santa" would be stationed nearby a drug den. This leads me to believe one of two things. Either this Santa was just getting off work from his second job at the Galleria and didn't have time to change. Or, when the call came in, he and his partner decided to mess with the drug dealers. I choose to believe Option B.</p><blockquote>THUG #1: Who's at the door?<br /><br />THUG #2: I think it's Santa Claus. He's got a hammer.<br /><br />THUG #1: I'm so hiiiiiiiiiiiigh.</blockquote><p>More importantly, I NEED to see this turned into a movie. It would be like <em>Die Hard</em> meets <em>The Santa Clause</em> meets the Beastie Boys video for "Sabotage." Get to work, Hollywood!</p><p><p>

## 'You f***ing t***ts': Leftwing protesters brag about being dragged across pavement, don't realize they're the baddies

Politicians throughout all of the United States of the Americas have the choice between siding with parents and taxpayers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-democrats-teachers-unions" target="_blank">or the teachers' unions</a>. Keeping in mind that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teachers-union-ad-parents" target="_blank">the latter group despises the former group</a>, it's an easy decision for DeSantis to put parents first. That's why he announced he wants a "Paycheck Protection" bill passed.</p><p>DeSantis wants the government to stop taking donations to the Democrat party right out of a teacher's paycheck...actually, I misspoke. He wants the government to stop automatically deducting union dues.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NEW: Gov. Ron DeSantis says he wants a “Paycheck Protection” bill passed.<br /><br />He says it prevents government from deducting union dues from teacher paychecks. Instead, teachers would need to write checks to the unions.<br /><br />“That maximizes freedom to choose" <a href="https://t.co/7ouyogmATm">pic.twitter.com/7ouyogmATm</a><br />— Lydia Nusbaum (@LydiaNusbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/LydiaNusbaum/status/1604936642942345230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>First of all, you totally do not have to join a teachers' union. But if you do, the government, we don’t want to play a role in deducting anybody’s money so you write every month for the dues and you do it that way.</blockquote><p>Some of you are wondering, "But Brodigan, why doesn't he just announce a new NFT?" Two reasons. One, lol...you just said "butt Brodigan." Two, while not flashy, it's a subtle policy change that chips away at the progressive agenda.</p><p>You're used to having the government take money out of your paycheck, so you don't think about it. It's "out of sight, out of mind." Union members don't think about it the same way you don't think about your taxes being taken out. Then you become self-employed, have to consciously write the check yourself every few months, and slowly become more and more of an anti-tax libertarian when you see how much you give vs how much you get. When union members are forced to cut the check themselves, they're going to wonder what value they are actually getting.</p><p>Leftists know that as long as you don't think about it, you don't notice how much they're taking or what they're using it for. It's similar to some places where your school taxes are added to your mortgage payment. When you are paying off a $500,000 home, you don't notice an additional $10k-$20k a year. Not until you pay off your home, your kids are out of school, and every six months you realize "wait, where is this money going?"</p><p>DeSantis is looking to change that. Now imagine this on a national level.</p><p><p>
