The game is noted as being most similar to Yakuza 5, as it uses the same Climax Heat system, but overall, differs greatly from the series.

While decidedly less cartoonish, Skull and Bones is a tactical action game set on the open sea that allows players to team up and engage in piracy and naval warfare. In addition to this multiplayer mode, the game also features a single-player campaign set in the Indian Ocean. Originally intended as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff, Skull and Bones has been in development since 2013.

The upcoming sequel is said to have a \"wider Metroidvania approach\" than Fallen Order, as well as an emphasis on honing your individual fighting style.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil 4 Remake - March 24, 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079409-4052279-re4.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Following the success of Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake, Capcom has turned their attention to one of the most critically-acclaimed titles in the horror series: Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 follows series mainstay Leon S. Kennedy as he travels to a rural village in Spain to rescue the US President's daughter. Once Leon arrives, he discovers the village has been compromised by a violent, parasite-worshiping cult named Los Illuminados. The upcoming remake boasts impressive visuals and a handful of quality-of-life changes, such as a greatly enhanced parry system.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dead Island 2 - April 28, 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079410-egs_deadisland2_deepsilverdambusterstudios_s1_2560x1440-fdc688ce46680914ee3c4a7949ce8a67.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The long-awaited numbered sequel to 2011's Dead Island, Dead Island 2 is set several months after the events of Dead Island: Riptide in sunny Los Angeles, California. But while the weather might be nice, the conditions are far from perfect, as the zombie apocalypse has forced the city into a strict lockdown. In Dead Island 2, you play as a survivor who has been infected via zombie bite. However, instead of succumbing to your wounds, this bite grants you some unusual powers you can harness against the living dead as you hunt them down in this over-the-top action-RPG.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Street Fighter 6 - June 2, 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079411-4036678-sf6roster.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Capcom's legendary fighting game series returns with Street Fighter 6. 12 familiar faces are set to return to the series in this next entry--including fan-favorites Ryu, Guile, Cammy, and Chun-Li--along with six new characters.

Set in the familiar yet ever-grim world of Sanctuary, Diablo IV sees you take on the role of a powerful warrior on a mission to stop the demon Lilith and the cult that summoned her. The game features five classes--Barbarian, Sorceress, Rogue, Druid, and Necromancer--as well as the series' iconic loot-grinding gameplay loop. Familiar systems return, such as skill trees and runes, along with three new attributes: Angelic, Demonic, and Ancestral Power.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XVI - June 22, 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019271-finalfantasyxvi.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The next chapter in the Final Fantasy mainline series appears to be an <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-dumped-traditional-turn-based-combat-so-that-it-could-appeal-to-younger-gamers/1100-6505477/\">action-packed blend of swords and sorcery</a> that follows in the footsteps of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Featuring a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-is-an-ambitious-more-mature-entry-in-the-series-says-producer/1100-6504803/\">more mature storyline</a> with conflicts between multiple worlds and ample political drama, Final Fantasy XVI will follow protagonist Clive Rosfield, the son of an archduke, throughout three different eras of his life. While it's not an open-world game, the unique areas look ripe for exploration, and there will be <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-wont-be-an-open-world-game-but-its-eikon-battles-will-all-be-unique/1100-6504814/\">large-scale boss fights featuring Eikon.</a> For more details, check out a detailed roundup of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-everything-we-know/1100-6485789/\">everything we currently know about Final Fantasy XVI.</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Assassin's Creed Mirage - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079415-ac-mirage-basim-side-profile.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The 13th installment in the Assassin's Creed mainline series, Assassin's Creed Mirage is set in 9th century Baghdad and follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character introduced in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Ubisost has described the game as a return to the series' roots, with less focus on RPG elements and a renewed emphasis on linear storytelling and stealth. <em>Mirage</em> also marks the return of the series' Black Box assassination missions, which task players with finding unique ways to eliminate dangerous targets.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Eternights - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019273-eternights.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If you thought the regular dating game was tough, try finding a partner when the apocalypse is around the corner. Eternights is a dating action game that blends dungeon-crawling exploration with a chance to romance a cast of five quirky and lovable characters. You'll need to scavenge, survive, and build relationships while facing a ticking clock, but the stronger your bond becomes with your party, the more powerful you'll become as you unlock unique skills and spells that you can use in battle.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019270-marvel%27sspider-man2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Insomniac is doubling down on web-slingers for its next Spider-Man game and pitting them against some familiar villains. While details on how the game will evolve the spider-formula are still being kept under wraps, what we do know is that the sequel will be <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-is-being-compared-to-the-empire-strikes-back/1100-6496671/\">darker than the first entry in the series</a> and is being compared to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. As for villains, you can expect to tangle with slimy symbiote Venom, voiced by none other than Candyman actor Tony Todd.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079416-ss_fed60f765e3b5facf915d0b70b7a05105aa3525b.1920x1080.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Rocksteady is returning to the DC Universe with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A noticeable departure from the Batman: Arkham series, Kill the Justice League follows the super villain-turned-anti-hero group The Suicide Suqad as they are given the seemingly impossible task of killing the alien invader Brainiac and any members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by him. The game features four playable characters--Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and King Shark--a whole lot of multiplayer fun, and most notably, Kevin Conroy's final performance as Batman following his passing on November 10, 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019272-finalfantasyviirebirth.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake was a perfect example of how to revitalize a a classic game, and with the opening chapter behind it, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks set to chart new ground as the middle chapter for the ambitious trilogy. Details are naturally being kept under lock and key, but creative director Tetsuya Nomura did mention that development of Rebirth has been \"progressing rapidly since we adopted a new development structure,\" and that some development of the third game is already in progress as well.</p><p>Nomura also added that Rebirth is being developed in such a way that you don't need to have played the original version of Final Fantasy VII, nor do you even necessarily need to have played Remake (though we'd definitely recommend it). Rebirth is expected to launch between December 2023 and March 2024.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marvel's Wolverine - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019275-marvel%27swolverine.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's still early days for Spider-Man developer Insomniac's <em>next </em>Marvel game, but the studio is getting ready to put everyone's favorite mutant back in the video game spotlight. Details are naturally slim at this point in time, but if the trailer is anything to go by, then this mature take on Wolverine should be a bloody adventure where the berserker is more than ready to prove that he's the best there is at what he does. And what he does ain't pretty, <em>bub</em>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4079418-ss_c0e2e0bf843a964df1bc6e561ebcd9bb3eeb4bad.1920x1080.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the most notable survival-horror games of all time is getting the remake treatment in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Originally released in 2001, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he searches the eerie town of Silent Hill (hey, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/we-went-to-the-abandoned-town-that-inspired-the-silent-hill-movie/2900-4388/\">we went there last year!</a>) for his thought-to-be-deceased wife. The game primarily consists of solving riddles and puzzles as well as avoiding death--particularly at the hands of the iconic villain Pyramid Head. Upon release, the game was praised for its dark themes, smart use of symbolism, and shocking plot. While Bloober Team has not stated all the changes coming to the remake, most notably is the pivot to an \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person perspective, similar to the recent Resident Evil remakes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake (indefinitely delayed)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4019276-starwarsknightsoftheoldrepublicremake.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, considered to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time, is in a perilous position right now. We're holding out for that New Hope, even if the project <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed-indefinitely-according-to-report/1100-6505913/\">might be delayed indefinitely</a> following a stall in development at studio Aspyr Media.

There are a total of five lightsaber stances, including a dual-blade stance and one where Cal wields both a lightsaber and a blaster. A new heavy and slow style uses the crossguard lightsaber, as introduced by Kylo Ren. These new stances will let you hit harder or from farther away, but whether you should use them depends on the enemies you will be facing. As Asmussen said in the interview, \"it requires the player to break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is.\"</p><p>Survivor will also offer more options for travel, allowing for what Asmussen called \"a wider Metroidvania approach.\" You can use an ascension cable to climb walls or cross gaps. You can also tame and ride mounts. According to Asmussen, players can use a variety of skills to hop across unthinkable barriers.

Here is the FTC's breakdown of eligible parties (as written by the FTC):</p><ul><li>Parents whose children made an unauthorized credit card purchase in the Epic Games Store between January 2017 and November 2018</li><li>Fortnite players who were charged in-game currency (V-Bucks) for unwanted in-game items (such as cosmetics, llamas, or battle passes) between January 2017 and September 2022</li><li>Fortnite players whose accounts were locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after disputing unauthorized charges with their credit card companies.</li></ul><h3>How to get a refund</h3><p>Those who believe they are eligible for money back don't need to do anything currently, the FTC said. The refund program is still being assembled, it seems. \"When we have more information about the refund program, we will post updates here and send email notices to customers who paid for in-game purchases,\" the FTC said.

But Chainsaw Man was already an incredibly popular manga long before the anime dropped. You wanna know how I know? Because cosplayers are all over it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I was at London Comic Con back in October, which kicked off just a couple of days after the anime's third episode was released.

Over the past two years, the pandemic completely changed the way that most people shop for desirable items such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X. In recent months, however, there have been indications that the new shortage culture surrounding video game consoles might be fading--at least in the short term.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you tried to get your hands on a PS5 or Xbox Series X in the past two years, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Eager would-be buyers were greeted by \"out-of-stock\" messages at every retailer. Advertised restocks would run dry within a minute or two after the gate opened, if they didn't crash for you in the first-place. This isn't the first console shortage that gamers have dealt with--the Wii suffered from issues at launch--but it's arguably the worst ever. However, while the Xbox Series X became relatively easy to find in 2022, the PS5 has continued to suffer from serious supply constraints.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The pandemic-era shortages can be blamed on a wide variety of factors: an increased interest in gaming as a hobby, ongoing shortages of important components, and general supply-chain issues. During that period, it was virtually impossible to buy a new-gen console for MSRP without using outside resources to locate the right opportunities. Desperate buyers turned to a secondary culture of Discord servers, Telegram channels, and Twitch streams in order to find the next drop and take advantage.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-years-of-discord-servers-and-timed-drops-you-can-maybe-buy-a-ps5-at-a-store/1100-6510190/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-years-of-discord-servers-and-timed-drops-you-can-maybe-buy-a-ps5-at-a-store/1100-6510190/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2022-12-20 17:10:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best PlayStation Plus Games December 2022", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4077988-psdec_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Brought to you by PlayStation Plus.

And don't try to say you've never fantasized about something like it before--just imagine how great your life would be if you never had to deal with an angry customer or a condescending boss ever again. Imagine how much lighter you'd feel if the hours you spent at work felt like going in and waking up from surgical anesthetic, just without all the potential side effects and pain.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Except, there's a dark side to that story, too, because <em>something </em>has to actually make the work happen, right?

However, it's worth noting that Nintendo usually replaces Joy-Cons with drift free of charge if you contact Nintendo Support.

Persistent rumors have suggested that Nintendo is planning a new \"Pro\" edition that will help it keep pace with more powerful competitors, but so far that hasn't come to fruition. Right now, there is no indication from Nintendo that a new model is on the horizon, or if the company is preparing a successor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can check below for the full list of big coming to the Switch in 2023 and beyond.

Set 1,000 years after four kingdoms sealed away the powerful Fell Dragon, Fire Emblem Engage sees that creature returning, and it's up to the humanoid Divine Dragon to save the world. This hero won't be able to do so alone, however, as past Fire Emblem characters like Marth will be available via summons and the tag-team \"Engage\" system to inherit their weapons and deal devastating attacks. It looks to be a classic turn-based tactical Fire Emblem experience that should be perfect for both new and old players.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fire Emblem Engage releases for Nintendo Switch on January 20, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017893-littlenemoandthenightmarefiends.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">For fans of adventuring with a dreamy twist, try to keep your eyes open for Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends. A unique journey through Slumberland, you'll have four characters to guide--brave Nemo, the magic-wielding Princess, the mischievous clown Flip, and the agile royal guard Peony--as you explore a world based on Winsor McCay's landmark 1905 comic strip. The dreamscape is surreal, the waking world hides secrets of its own, and each character will bring a unique way to play the game thanks to their inherent traits and skills. With a soundtrack by Wayne Strange, Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends is shaping up to be an enticing all-nighter of a game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blanc - February 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4079291-maxresdefault.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A lovely game rendered entirely in a black-and-white pencil sketched style, Blanc tells the story of an unlikely friendship between a wolf cub and a fawn. The game can be played in single-player but it's built for co-op as you explore the quest to find safety in an isolated, snowy wilderness. The story is wordless, so it's meant to be enjoyed by players of any age or skill level. It's coming in February 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gunbrella - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4079293-ss_1c11307def011b54f5975009199a06368d3ce2dd.600x338.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This noir-action game has a creative title that tells you exactly what it is. You're armed with a Gunbrella, a firearm that also serves as an umbrella, as you take down cultists, gangsters, and other threats on your quest for revenge. It's the follow-up to the indie hit Gato Roboto for developer Doinksoft and marks another interesting-looking indie game being published by Devolver Digital.

Now we get to revisit it with a fresh new look in the form of<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/advance-wars-1-plus-2-re-boot-camp/\"> Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp</a>, a Nintendo Switch remake of the first two games. Featuring turn-based gameplay on a grid, the Advance Wars games see you assume the role of one of various Commanding Officers directing troops to victory, with each military group capable of using game-changing special abilities, such as unit repairs or power boosts. Developer WayForward (Shantae, River City Girls) has got the job with the remake, breathing new life into the series that will now feature online multiplayer in addition to the campaigns and local play included in the original release.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp had been scheduled for December 2021, but was delayed to April 2022 for fine-tuning.

You'll have to discover the answer to that question yourself, as Loco Motive puts you in the gumshoes of a rookie detective, lawyer, and an undercover spy as they race to prove their innocence before the real killer strikes again. While the setup is grim, the rest of the game plays out like a slapstick whodunnit as you interact with fellow passengers. Loco Motive has a delightful pixel art aesthetic, a moody soundtrack by Space Haven's Paul Zimmerman, and plenty of puzzles that'll likely leave you scratching your head.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/loco-motive-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Garden Path - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017889-thegardenpath.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The gaming calendar is usually full of intense action games, but for a change of pace, make friends with a talking onion in this relaxing gardening game. The Garden Path doesn't just sound like a cathartic reason to sit back and tend to a patch of ground that needs a green thumb touch; it's also a slice-of-life simulator that looks fantastic with its painterly aesthetic.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk - TBA 2022</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017888-bombrushcyberfunk.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A very funky expression of personal style, graffiti, and crisp cel-shaded visuals, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is shaping up to be the Jet Set Radio spiritual successor that fans have been waiting for. It's all about increasing your rep in every neighborhood, tagging walls with a can of spray-paint, and challenging other crews for local supremacy in a tricky showdown. Beyond that urban jungle appeal, expect to master your tricks of the trade with environments that are just begging for you to perform grinding, sliding, wall-running, and air maneuvers.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mineko's Night Market - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017886-mineko%27snightmarket.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Another narrative-driven and social simulation adventure game for the pile, Mineko's Night Market is also a celebration of Japanese culture and a story about friendship. Intertwined with themes of tradition--and a whole lot of cats--you'll guide Mineko as she solves puzzles, takes part in market games, and sneaks past government agents with the use of clever disguises. Boasting hours of exploration through its many environments and four seasons to experience, don't be too surprised to find yourself engaging in some wheeling and dealing with locals to help progress the story.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/minekos-night-market-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rune Fencer Illyia - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017885-runefencerillyia.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>An action-packed platformer that's focused on both exploration and combat, you'll play as a young Runist named Illyia of Moonstone who is on a journey to find her missing twin sister and a way home. There's plenty of danger along the path though, but Illyia quickly picks up some sharp sword skills and powerful runic magic that'll help her survive in a hostile land. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - May 12, 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017884-thelegendofzeldabreathofthewild2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is not only one of the greatest Zelda games ever, but one of the greatest video games of all time. How do you follow something like that up?

A combination of gorgeous pixel art and fluid animation, Metal Slug Tactics features series powerhouses Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma and their over-the-top arsenal in an isometric tactics format that looks fun, clever, and explosive ahead of its eventual release.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Minecraft Legends - 2023</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4079290-3989862-gamespot_conferencethumb_site.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mojang has been branching out with the Minecraft brand recently, and Minecraft Legends will mark another new take on the popular block-building franchise. This time it's a third-person action-strategy game, where you control a heroic unit leading your mobs of farm animals and other Minecraft mainstays into battle, and fortifying your defenses with the familiar building tools. The story revolves around the Nether, the corrupt dark side of the Minecraft universe. It's said to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer, and it's scheduled to release in the first half of 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metroid Prime 4 - TBA</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4017881-metroidprime4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Metroid Prime 4 has been in development for many years at this point, and development even restarted in 2019 when Retro Studios took over. There's still no word on a release window, and no one really knows how far along in development it actually is.

Now, one fan-modder has released a total overhaul that allows the game to be easily played on modern systems, and it includes vital features like 4K support, better mouse-look, and a revamped save system.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Previously, the best option to play Dark Forces was using the DOSbox emulator, which only supports resolutions up to 320x200.

In a new interview with <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-phil-lord-chris-miller-2023-preview/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, creative duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller have revealed some new details about the film's sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The second in a planned trilogy, Spider-Verse 2 will star Miles Morales yet again, a few years older and wiser. However, while the first film was all about other Spider-People invading his universe, this time, Miles will adventure across the multiverse himself. The film will also feature returning characters like Spider-Gwen and Peter B. Parker. Lord and Miller estimate that about 240 characters were designed for the film, so expect to see a lot of new faces.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Two major new characters include Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099, who was teased in the credits of the first film. Jason Schwartzman will play a villain known as the Spot, who has the ability to create portals to different dimensions. Lord and Miller describe him as a classic cartoon baddy, similar to Wile E.

HBO changed the landscape with series like Sopranos, Oz, and The Wire, and very quickly, other networks followed suit. TV became more than sitcoms filmed before a studio audience that dominated the '80s and '90s. TV became more complex, more mature, and the overall quality increased. And since then, with the expansion of streaming services, there is simply too much high-quality content to keep up with.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, it felt like there was more new content than ever. Between networks, cable, and streaming, there are dozens upon dozens of TV series worth watching. Whether it is the latest Star Wars series on Disney+ or something innovative happening at FX--which is a lot more than you think--there is no shortage of high-quality television to watch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And the list of great shows keeps growing, especially when services like Prime Video are dumping millions of dollars into creating a Lord of the Rings universe or HBO is continuing to build out its Game of Thrones brand with the prequel House of the Dragon or even Disney+ going beyond Marvel and Star Wars shows to bring back franchises like Willow and The Santa Clause as shows..</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So the staff of GameSpot came together to ask, \"What are the best TV shows of the past year?\" After long discussions about our favorite series, we came up with our Top 10 TV shows of the year, with the best TV show of the year. So check out the staff's favorite series of this past year.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Andor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1562/15626911/4078596-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We had every reason to be skeptical of Andor, the third Star Wars show this year on a platform that gave us the forgettable Book of Boba Fett and the fine-but-not-great Obi-Wan Kenobi. For one thing, a show based on a secondary character from Rogue One--the dashing and ethically compromised Rebel spy Cassian Andor--didn't seem terribly necessary. Imagine our surprise when the outcome was a prestige TV drama that stands apart from its source material.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's nary a Jedi in sight in Andor, which focuses on the first year of Cassian's recruitment into a fledgling rebel alliance. The story is more grounded and relatable, as it takes seriously both the stakes and the inner workings of the rebellion and the Empire. This is a show about interlocking systems of power and how they influence and ricochet off of each other, and it accomplishes this storytelling trick by focusing on individuals within those power structures. The Empire isn't a broad villain, but a collection of ambitious bureaucrats who feel utterly righteous even in the face of their own sadism. The Rebellion at this point a collection of loosely affiliated power brokers, dissidents, and guerrilla warriors, starting to find common cause. In most of Star Wars, we're told that the Empire is an oppressive force. In Andor, we see that oppression up close: how it grows and metastasizes, how it chokes out everyday life, and how those who fight against it are forced to surrender their own peace of mind.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the context in which we explore themes like what we're willing to sacrifice, how to confront fascism, the prison industrial complex, and the legacy of revolutionary ideas that live beyond their creators. Buoyed by Emmy-worthy performances from Stellan Skarsgard and Fiona Shaw and well-written dialogue that consistently delivers instantly-iconic moments, this is the smartest and most resonant Star Wars has ever been. -- <em>Steve Watts</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Rehearsal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1562/15626911/4078595-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">After four seasons of Nathan For You, it seemed like Nathan Fielder's fanbase had a pretty good idea of what to expect from his next reality project, but there is no way they could ever prepare for The Rehearsal. Billed as a chance for participants to \"rehearse\" important upcoming events in their lives so they could go off without a hitch, The Rehearsal is really an examination of what would happen if reality and fiction became so blurred that it was no longer possible to determine truth. The Rehearsal takes what Synecdoche, New York did in a fictional world and attempts to make it real, and that is as bizarre and hilarious as it sounds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">From the opening minutes of the first episode, Nathan Fielder makes it very clear that you should not try to guess what is going to happen next, because you will be wrong. He jokes with his first participant--an avid trivia-night player with a dark secret--that he had already rehearsed their initial consultation ahead of time. Except that wasn't a joke: Nathan had secretly scoped out the man's entire apartment and had it recreated at full scale, putting a stand-in actor inside so he could run through the conversation they'd have <em>about </em>rehearsing an upcoming event. It's unhinged, creepy, and so funny that you'll likely have to pause each episode several times while you laugh.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As Nathan finds himself more directly inserted into the rehearsals he's doing with his clients, The Rehearsal goes so far off the rails--in a good way--that I have legitimately no idea how he plans to top it with the upcoming second season. What I have learned, however, is to not question Nathan Fielder, who seems incapable of making anything that isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious and wholly unique. <em>--</em> <em>Gabe Gurwin</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Boys</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078597-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 3 of Prime Video's adaptation of the comic book series The Boys was the best season to date. Building on the past two seasons, the latest offering of episodes parodies what's happening in the real world, surrounding corporate takeovers, politics, and parodying one thing not so much happening in the real world: superhero content.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This year's episodes were a game-changer for the show and the overall dynamic of The Seven. Without getting into major spoilers, it dived into a place where the future of the show seemed very exciting as the power dynamic of The Seven and Vought International was changing directions. For a show that's all about surprising the viewer--with typically shocking moments--it's great to see The Boys push the envelope by turning the well-established world on its head. Plus, we got to see a whole bunch of Jensen Ackles this season as he took on the role of Soldier Boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There was also the highly-anticipated adaptation of the outrageous Herogasm storyline, which was slimmed down to one episode. Although it was a pretty big departure from the source material, the way the setting was woven into Season 3's storyline was perfect. Of course, we got some exceptionally shocking moments--<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-showrunner-and-mothers-milk-actor-break-down-the-grossest-moment-from-herogasm/1100-6504902/\">like the \"throwing ropes\" scene</a>--but the latest batch of episodes of The Boys was a homerun. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Better Call Saul</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1562/15626911/4078598-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It's difficult to say anything about Better Call Saul that hasn't already been said. The show shouldn't have worked, Breaking Bad didn't need a spin-off to begin with, and a character like Saul Goodman should not have been compelling enough to carry multiple seasons. And yet, somehow, against all odds, here we are. Better Call Saul did everything right, from the way it handled its own forgone conclusion head-on to the way it maintained some level of mystery for its compelling supporting cast. It was heartbreaking, anxiety-inducing, and frequently hilarious. It took the groundwork laid by Breaking Bad and ran, pulling off victory lap after victory lap--but most importantly, it stuck the landing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It'll be lucky if we see another show this well crafted and this well executed any time soon, but thankfully, with the entire show now finished and the last season in the books, we can go back and relive the experience as many times as we want to fill the void. -- <em>Mason Downey</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Our Flag Means Death</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078599-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to the MCU, Taika Waititi's name has become close to ubiquitous in mainstream pop culture, but before he was part of the biggest franchise on Earth, Waititi was teaming up with his fellow New Zealanders to make some of the funniest and most absurd comedy around. Our Flag Means death thrust Waititi and his frequent collaborator Rhys Darby back in front of the camera to return to that form in this quasi-historical romantic comedy about the golden age of piracy in the 18th century.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But what makes Our Flag Means Death truly special, beyond just the fact that it's definitely one of the funniest shows around this year, is the fearless and fresh angle it takes on familiar pirate legends. Waititi and Darby play Blackbeard and Stede Bonnet respectively, but rather than a pair of swashbuckling pals or pirate rivals, in this version of the story Blackbeard and Bonnet are star-crossed lovers, brought together (and subsequently torn apart) by circumstance. It's hilarious, heart-breaking, and, most importantly, some of the most clever TV you can watch this year. Come for all your favorite comedians making cameos, stay for the definitely historically accurate 18th century Crocs. -- <em>Mason Downey</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Chainsaw Man</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078601-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Every year, more and more anime events break through into mainstream American pop culture. In 2021, One Piece reached 1000 episodes. In 2022, the highly-anticipated manga Chainsaw Man was adapted into an anime, and it did not disappoint. With 12 episodes in Season 1--leading to the finale on December 27--Chainsaw Man not only grabbed the attention of the mainstream, but it's also just a brilliant show.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Following Denji, a devil hunter, the series is bombastic and never lets up. Even when horrific monsters aren't being sliced to bits by the main character--who can transform into a monster with a chainsaw coming out of his head and two out of his arms--the show is shockingly fun and intense. Studio MAPPA is behind the show, and following its other recent anime like Jujutsu Kaisen and Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man has a perfect home with this studio, as it's some of their best work yet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Filled with emotional backstories and complex characters--some of whom are way too horny for their own good--Chainsaw Man hits all the notes of what an anime series is like, while, in many ways, being a great entrance-level show for those new to the genre. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Bear</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078602-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Who knew making Italian beef sandwiches could be such a high-stress environment? The Bear follows Carmy Berzatto, an award-winning chef that is more or less forced to return to his family's Italian beef sandwich shop to run it after the death of his brother. The premise is ridiculously simple, but the tension that radiates off the kitchen as cooks clash, family members quarrel, and Carmy tries to force a new and refined menu into a restaurant that relies on a classic dish is mesmerizing to watch.</p><p>That, of course, is thanks in large part to the cast led by Jeremy Allen White (Carmy), who somehow plays an even <em>more</em> Chicago-y kind of guy than he did as Lip on Shameless. The first season of The Bear was more or less a prologue to the overall story being told of Carmy and his motley crew of misfit cooks and business associates (and siblings) attempting to take their reliable family business and make something more that they can all be proud of. And, along the way, they'll chain smoke, scream at each other, quit repeatedly, and probably sell drugs from behind the counter. -- <em>Chris E. Hayner</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078603-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077 experienced a rough launch, but it built a world that was exceptionally compelling and intriguing. Netflix's 10-episode anime series expanded upon that brilliantly. Produced by Studio Trigger (Promare), Cyberpunk: Edgerunner follows a new protagonist in Night City, taking on some familiar corporations from the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is intense from start to finish. Watching the protagonist David slowly go from school dropout to super-powered edgerunner is an incredible journey, and the series is incredible at making you care about everyone on this show.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a season that will fly by. 10 episodes will feel like an hour of view time with how engaging the show is. It feels like a cyberpunk anime from the '80s or '90s--drawing a lot of comparisons to Battle Angel, in the best way possible. Calling Edgerunners action-packed is almost like you're downplaying it, as the action sequences are over-the-top in the best ways possible. It is an incredible adaptation that far surpasses expectations. -- <em>Mat Elfring</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Interview With the Vampire</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078604-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Adaptations can be tricky things, especially when you're dealing with texts as beloved as Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, which already have a certified cult classic adaptation in the '90s Interview With The Vampire movie. We love Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise as Louis and Lestat as much as anyone, but we're just going to come right out and say it: The show is doing a better and more interesting thing with that story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">AMC's TV show is a masterclass in making smart, creative, and necessary changes to a source material in order to update it for a new era. A lot has changed since the book originally hit shelves, and even more has changed since the movie debuted in theaters, but the show understands all this and takes it in stride. And, with an incredible cast with even more incredible chemistry, Interview With the Vampire is easily one of the best and most unexpected shows of 2023. -- <em>Mason Downey</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>GameSpot's Top TV Show of 2022: Severance</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1562/15626911/4078605-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Originality in an age of franchise sequels and spin-offs is rare enough these days, but it's rarer to see an original work so successfully stick its landing. Severance--an exclusive to Apple TV+ and the service's best selling point--is that original work. Its basic premise is infinitely relatable, asking us what our lives would look like if we could completely separate our personal memories from our work memories. It quickly veers into the surreal and dark in a way that shows just how harmful that would be.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Severance immediately grabs you with its visual style and set design, which are like the platonic ideal of \"boring corporate office\" turned up to 11 and sterilized in an extremely creepy way. Often eerily quiet, the Lumon offices--where employees take numbers on their screen and sort them, for reasons unclear--seem friendly and calm at first glance, but like that unstable friend we all know, the slightest problem can show its true, terrifying colors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are plenty of iconic moments in Severance's first season, including the much-coveted egg bar and Waffle Party, but they wouldn't have the same hilarious and unnerving impact without the show's impeccable cast. Adam Scott's role as a team leader who is also unsure of his company's true motivations makes for an emotionally complex part, and standout supporting actors like Christopher Walken and John Turturro both show different pieces of the always-churning corporate machine. Perhaps the best is Zach Cherry, a worker who cares not about the morally ambiguous nature of his job, but instead about the little freebies he gets for hitting arbitrary goals. We can all appreciate a good plastic toy for our desk, even if we only remember they exist for about eight hours every day. -- <em>Gabe Gurwin</em></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-tv-shows-of-2022/2900-4550/", "date_published": "2022-12-20 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Sony's DualSense Edge Brings In-Depth Controller Customization To PS5", "description": "<p> PlayStation is leaping into the world of prosumer controllers with the DualSense Edge.

DualSense Edge lead product manager Tomamasu Mizuno assured me that this was an intentional decision so as to not alienate players who've already spent hundreds of hours with the standard DualSense. If you've held a PlayStation 5 controller before, then you know what the Edge will feel like in your hands. The biggest changes to the ergonomics are the new, rubbery grips on the back of the controller, the two function buttons, the trigger stops, and the customizable paddle buttons in the back.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The customizable back buttons are the thing that feel most different on the new controller. I had to adjust my grip ever so slightly to accommodate them. Unlike the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller's four, there are only two buttons on the back of the controller. The paddles jut out slightly more than the Elite controller's, meaning it requires a tap to press rather than the squeeze motion I would normally do with an Elite controller. The package also comes with an alternate set of back buttons shaped like half moons. These felt more natural in my hands as they leaned right up against my middle fingers. Of course, you can remove the back buttons altogether if you'd like.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-dualsense-edge-brings-in-depth-controller-customization-to-ps5/1100-6510106/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-dualsense-edge-brings-in-depth-controller-customization-to-ps5/1100-6510106/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2022-12-20 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "High On Life Is Doing Great On Xbox Game Pass, Apparently", "description": "<p>Squanch Games' wild and wacky shooter High On Life is tearing it up on Xbox Game Pass, it seems. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjiSales/status/1604886228733759490\">Benji Sales on Twitter</a> found a list that showed the new game from Ricky and Morty's Justin Roiland as the No. 1 \"most-popular\" Xbox Game Pass title earlier this week.

And that, in and of itself, is remarkably rare in games.\" He also alludes to the changing of certain elements to better fit the medium of TV, in collaboration with the game's writer and director Neil Druckmann.

If Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One is your console of choice, there's plenty to be excited about, with several console exclusives and many third-party titles coming to Microsoft's platforms in 2023 and beyond. Below, we detail the games we're most anticipating in the new year, from Embark Studios' Arc Raiders to Outerloop Games' Thirsty Suitors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In order to keep this list manageable, I'm holding myself to the rule that for a game to be included on this list, we must have seen gameplay of it at some point. I'm sure Xbox's future first-party titles like Avowed and Fable will wow, and there are some great-sounding third-party games on the horizon like Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and Assassin's Creed Mirage. But for now, let's try to reign in the hype and save our excitement for games where we actually know what the game looks like to play.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, even with that limitation, there are still a <em>ton </em>of games to look forward to--too many to list all of them. We had to draw the line somewhere or this article would have never been finished! Of the games picked, we've listed them in alphabetical order.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arc Raiders</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/4079160-arc.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Arc Raiders is an upcoming free-to-play, co-op, third-person shooter from developer Embark Studios.

Arc Raiders is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Atomic Heart</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/4079161-atomic.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Atomic Heart is an upcoming first-person shooter from developer Mundfish. Taking place in a fictional alternate history, Atomic Heart is set in the Soviet Union in 1955. After the USSR developed advanced robotics to defeat Nazi Germany, the Soviets were inspired to go all-in on a high-tech future, creating an entirely automatic labor force controlled by a collective hivemind. Brilliant move. No obvious downsides. Anyway, as a Soviet KGB officer, you're gifted an experimental power glove and a healthy array of firearms and told to go stop the army of freakish robotic monsters now trying to end the lives of their human creators. Atomic Heart is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on February 21, 2023.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/atomic-heart\">See at Xbox</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blue Protocol</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/4079162-blueprotocol_presskit_cinematic_act2_charlotteintro.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Blue Protocol is an upcoming action-RPG with MMO elements from developer Bandai Namco.

Like those games, Cocoon seems to explore its tale wordlessly, as you explore increasingly strange alien worlds, each of which can be carried as a small orb on your back. Every orb presents a new world to dive into and uncover, and each possesses a unique ability as well--like illuminating unseen paths--creating Inception levels of world-within-world puzzles.

Dead Island 2 is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on April 28, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dead Space</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/4076579-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> Dead Space is an upcoming remake of the 2008 survival-horror game of the same name.

Surprisingly, Everspace 2 moves away from the beloved roguelike structure of its predecessor and instead opts for an open-world, narrative-driven experience with a more thoughtful sci-fi story, optional side quests to pursue, and a lot more RPG-inspired elements. The moment-to-moment gameplay of frenetic dogfights that rewards skilled piloting and adaptability is largely the same--it's just as good as you remember if you played the first game. Currently in early access via Steam Early Access and GOG's Games in Development, the game's 1.0 build is set to officially launch for Xbox and PlayStation consoles (Rockfish has not clarified which ones specifically yet) and PC in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/4029500-flintlock.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is an upcoming open-world action-RPG with Souls-like-inspired combat from developer A44 Games.
