<p>Zelenskiy may visit Washington; Ukraine warned to prepare for more attacks on energy infrastructure</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit the White House and the US Capitol on Wednesday,</strong> though security concerns could force a change in plans, two sources familiar with the planning said Tuesday. The trip, which would be Zelenskiy’s first known foreign visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.</p><p><strong>President Zelenskiy visited the frontline city of Bakhmut on Tuesday.</strong> He met military representatives and handed out awards to soldiers, his office has said.</p><p><strong>A blast ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline that leads from Russia through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</strong> Reuters reported that three people died in the incident.</p><p><strong>Ukraine was warned to prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.</strong> Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Moscow wanted Ukraine to spend Christmas and new year in darkness.</p><p><strong>Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said the situation in four areas of eastern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – that Moscow illegally annexed in September, was “extremely difficult”.</strong> Russia’s illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions.</p><p><strong>The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday condemned Iran’s support for Russia in its war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, </strong>but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amid deteriorating Iran-EU relations,” Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan.</p><p><strong>Ukraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets </strong>to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others – including heroes of this year’s war. Since the war began, Ukraine’s leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its communist past into one of “de-Russification”.</p><p><strong>China says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to “further deepen” cooperation between the two countries whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscow’s invasion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a></strong>. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by China’s eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-301-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

A misunderstanding – or possibly an argument – with Clash manager and Specials champion Bernard Rhodes over some hotel damage provided the initial inspiration for songwriter Jerry Dammers’ lyrical odyssey about paranoia and surveillance. Hall sang two vocals – one bored and deadpan, one combative – which were then mixed to startling effect. The song began life on 5,000 hand-stamped singles; eventually it reached No 8 and kickstarted the 2 Tone sound’s ascent to global phenomenon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/terry-hall-specials-fun-boy-three">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The exceptionally talented and dependable keyboardist could cope with whatever style was thrown at him – and bands remodelled their sound around him</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/martin-duffy-primal-scream-and-felt-keyboardist-dies-aged-55">Martin Duffy: Primal Scream and Felt keyboardist dies in fall at home aged 55</a></p><p>In the late David Cavanagh’s definitive history of Creation Records, My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize, the 80s indie band Felt are depicted existing in a continual state of luckless disarray. Their hugely original albums ultimately prove influential – on Belle and Sebastian, the Charlatans and Manic Street Preachers among others – and provoke a rabid cult following, but everything else goes wrong. Band members depart with alarming regularity, career-boosting magazine cover features are pulled at the last minute, a gig packed with interested parties from major labels devolves into farcical chaos after lead singer Lawrence Hayward elects to take LSD before going on stage. But even by Felt’s standards, 1985 found them in a tight spot: they had just scored a No 1 single on the indie chart with Primitive Painters, but their guitarist Maurice Deebank – whose classical-inspired filigree defined their sound – had left for good. For once, Felt’s luck was in. While hopefully putting up an advert in a record store for new musicians, Hayward had been informed of a “genius” keyboard player who had just left school aged 16. It was Martin Duffy.</p><p>It turned out that Hayward’s informant wasn’t exaggerating: Duffy was a preternaturally gifted musician. He had first appeared on Ignite the Seven Canons, an album on which Deebank also appeared – but after the guitarist’s departure, Felt dramatically remodelled their sound around Duffy. His organ playing dominated 1986’s Forever Breathes the Lonely Word, suddenly lending Felt something of the feel of Bob Dylan’s mid-60s recordings with Al Kooper. They began releasing a succession of gorgeous piano instrumentals, featuring Duffy alone: the B-sides Magellan and Autumn, Sending Lady Load, which took up most of one side of 1988’s The Pictorial Jackson Review.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/primal-scream-and-felts-martin-duffy-the-gifted-sideman-who-was-endlessly-adaptable">Continue reading...</a>

James Cameron’s 3D space fantasy spectacular <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/avatar-the-way-of-water-opens-box-office-1235284282/">has opened to a staggering $441m (£362m) across the globe</a>, but its US bow of an estimated $134m (£110m) is down on expectations, if only just. If the first movie, the highest-grossing film of all time, was Dances with Wolves in space (with a side-order of FernGully: The Last Rainforest), then part two is a family affair, with Cameron digging into his experiences as a father to imagine what battling to save your planet from evil humans would be like if you had a bunch of giant blue space elf sprogs in tow, constantly putting themselves in harm’s way.</p><p>This is only the second Avatar movie in a proposed seven-film saga that the 68-year-old film-maker admits may well be completed after his death. Does it do enough to keep us all interested? Is the 3D as mind-boggling as it was the first time around? And does the decision to bring back Stephen Lang as a new, all-blue avatar version of big meanie Colonel Quaritch (who we all thought was dead) pay off? What do we think of Cameron’s shift from the forests of Pandora to its breathtaking oceans?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/20/avatar-the-way-of-water-the-new-aliens-daddy-issues-and-camerons-message-discuss-with-spoilers">Continue reading...</a>

About 150 figures progressed the length of the Duveen Galleries, many on foot, some on horseback, some carried, one in a wheelchair. There were guys in sharp suits and characters who might have stepped out of a Velásquez painting of the Spanish court. Others wore ferocious animal heads or faces like the creature from the Black Lagoon. Locke turned the Duveen into a dreamlike, carnivalesque space for encounters across time and borders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/20/the-best-art-and-architecture-of-2022">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My love of Avatar – and the support I found in other fans – helped me to embrace qualities in myself I had long hidden away</p><p>When my alarm went off just after midnight on Thursday, readying me for the drive to the 1:45am screening of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar--the-way-of-water">Avatar: The Way of Water</a> after three hours of fitful sleep, I experienced a brief moment of existential reckoning. The bargaining began: it’s been a long year, I’m 40, at the pointy end of my PhD, there’s Covid around … all I needed to do was turn the alarm off, and go back to sleep. To do so, however, would mean ignoring that before I went to bed, I had laid out my Kryolan greasepaint, ready to swipe across my face like Trudy Chacon when she went to war for the Omaticaya. It was time to return to Pandora.</p><p>In the long lead-up to the release of Cameron’s sequel to Avatar, it became de rigueur to claim that nobody remembered it. I’m not sure who kickstarted that particular myth about the highest-grossing movie of all time, but it certainly took hold; in 2014, Forbes ran a piece headlined <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/18/avatar-became-the-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-while-leaving-no-pop-culture-footprint/?sh=6c90da156159">“Five Years Ago, ‘Avatar’ Grossed $2.7 Billion but Left No Pop Culture Footprint”, while</a> the New York Times recently suggested that Avatar’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/magazine/avatar-franchise.html">“most oft-cited claim to fame is its surprising lack of cultural impact”</a>.

## Les Arts Florissants/Christie review – Christmas, 17th-century Paris-style

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>A range of seasonal and dramatic music by Marc-Antoine Charpentier was beautifully realised, the playing and singing sensuous and detailed</p><p>Advent and Christmas in late 17th-century Paris was the subject of this <a href="https://www.arts-florissants.org/main/en_GB/les-arts-florissants.html">Les Arts Florissants</a> concert, conducted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Christie_(musician)">William Christie</a> and focusing on music by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Antoine_Charpentier">Marc-Antoine Charpentier</a>. Given on Christie’s 78th birthday, it was an evening of contrasts in many ways. The first half interwove Charpentier’s austere Antiennes O de L’Avent with a sequence of instrumental Noëls, basically arrangements of popular carols of the day. After the interval came more dramatic – if more uneven – works, depicting the Adoration of the Shepherds: the pastorale <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zBnc9OmYg">Sur la Naissance de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ</a>; and the short oratorio In Nativitatem Domini Canticum.</p><p>The first half was astonishingly beautiful. The Antiennes, heralding the coming of Christ in music of great devotional fervour, were exquisitely sung, with everything wonderfully controlled and shaded, and a beautiful evenness of line from tenors and basses. The fourth antiphon O Clavis David, in which Charpentier adds women’s voices into the mix for the first time and opens up the continuo accompaniment to embrace the strings, suggesting a new world of infinite possibilities, had a breathtaking immediacy. The Noëls, meanwhile, played with wonderful sensuousness of tone and rhythmic precision, sounded poised and graceful. It was hard to imagine the sequence better done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/les-arts-florissants-christie-review-christmas-17th-century-paris-style">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Xbox, PlayStation, PC; Coffee Stain Studios<br /></strong>Drag voters to the polls as your physics-defying goat runs for president in the silliest game of the year which can now be savoured in multiplayer madness</p><p>Despite its title, this game does not simulate the life and interests of the typical European goat. It is also not actually the third in a series; it’s the second, following 2014’s Goat Simulator. Chalk the numerological skip up to developer Coffee Stain Studios’ frivolous tone: Goat Simulator 3 is absolutely loaded with bizarre non sequiturs, blissfully stupid gags, and wild cartoon violence. This is the silliest (or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/30/goat-simulator-3-making-the-stupidest-game-of-the-year-is-trickier-than-youd-think">stupidest</a>) game of the year, and its low-stakes chaos has a way of winning you over.</p><p>Embodying an indestructible, physics-defying goat, you run across the map at supersonic speeds, crashing through obstacles with a headbutt, all while dragging anything you want alongside your furry little legs with the elastic grip of your tongue. (This can include chairs, explosives, and unlucky human beings.) The joy is found in pushing the goofy, hallucinogenic physics system to its absolute breaking point. Your goat can bounce off a trampoline into low orbit, or smash oncoming traffic towards the distant horizon. The most interesting difference from 2014’s Goat Simulator, aside from the larger arena of chaos, is that you can now do all of this in multiplayer.</p><p>Goat Simulator 3 is out now; £24.99</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/20/goat-simulator-3-review-a-demented-self-destructive-caprine-bender">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite annual attempts at toppling Mariah, there hasn’t been a new Christmas classic in nearly a decade. Modern songwriters shoot too classy: history tells us that commotion is the only way</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/im-dreaming-of-a-bestseller-what-makes-christmas-songs-stick">Data: I’m dreaming of a bestseller – what makes Christmas songs stick?</a></p><p>When you think of the sound of Christmas, it’s Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bing Crosby battling over the same wholesome carols. Eartha Kitt and Elvis Presley banging out the horny (Santa Baby) and melancholy (Blue Christmas) pop classics with shades of divorce. Ex-members of the Beatles and their jaunty, war-torn offerings. Reliable and constant, old and faithful; still relatively close to traditional Hallmark card images of people gathered around an upright piano in front of an open fire. They are mainstays because they’re great songs, but also because modern hit-makers have struggled to replace them. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You is 28 years old. Even Kelly Clarkson’s Underneath the Tree, arguably the last modern addition to the Christmas canon, was released almost a decade ago.</p><p>The problem is that today’s songwriters shoot too classy. Remember Elton John and Ed Sheeran’s Merry Christmas? Nobody does. Ariana Grande and Leona Lewis have made worthy contributions to the modern canon, striking the perfect balance of frivolity and flair like Mariah before them, but they made the mistake of writing songs that are good because they’re good, not songs that are good because they’re slightly off their rocker. Christmas songs fail when they don’t reflect the spirit of the season, pairing nicely with the act of taking a drunk selfie in a paper hat at 10am. Having a buffet of freezer “bits” from Iceland as a between-meals snack. Dad spluttering swear words as he fails to assemble a child’s toy. Violent attempts to tranquillise the cat so it can travel five hours to Abergavenny without getting a stress injury. Ergo, a good modern Christmas song must reflect the intensifying chaos of the world. It must be willing to be a bit crap, but in the right way, and requires a really dialled-up, manic edge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/do-they-know-its-christmas-why-todays-meek-festive-pop-lacks-the-crucial-chaos-element">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People expect a young, blond disabled woman to be dainty and quiet. My DMs were evidence of my willingness to break the mould</p><p>It’s difficult to say if my first pair of Doc Martens boots were a Christmas present or a birthday present, since both fall on 25 December. Ten years later, I can’t remember if I opened them in the morning (which would make it Christmas, as far as I’m concerned), or the afternoon (which would make it my birthday). What I do know is I had just turned 17, they were luminous blue, and I loved them with all my teenage heart.</p><p>What’s strange is that over the next few years I barely wore them. Each term I devotedly ferried them up to university and then let them gather dust as I tried to fit in with the more conventional going-out attire of my peers. This, unfortunately for me, meant bodycon dresses and high heels – not an easy ensemble to pull off while sitting in a wheelchair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/20/i-loved-those-blue-doc-martens-with-all-my-teenage-heart-the-christmas-gift-ill-never-forget">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pick of the dark, devious and downright dumb sporting stories – and the antiheroes behind them</p><p>Alcohol, sportspeople and common sense are rarely seen together, and it’s been another year full of salutary stories. Take, for example, the South Korean three-time Olympic medal-winning speed skater Kim Min-seok, who in August gave three fellow skaters a lift home from a friend’s birthday party at the national training centre near Seoul, drove straight into a crash barrier and earned an 18-month ban from the sport (two of his passengers were banned for six months for abetting drink driving and a coach who wasn’t even there got a year for “lack of oversight”; Kim never got as far as a public road and thus avoided criminal prosecution). But the year’s most humiliating booze-related sporting incident came in Antalya in March, when the English snooker player Robert Milkins turned up for the opening ceremony of the Turkish Masters having already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/robert-milkins-apologises-for-turning-up-drunk-to-turkish-snooker-ceremony">enthusiastically celebrated his birthday</a>, drunkenly confronted a senior official, injured himself falling over in the toilets and ended up having his stomach pumped in hospital. “I genuinely don’t know exactly what happened, I was in a state where I didn’t know where I was,” he said. “When I got to the toilet I lost my legs and think I hit my chin on the sink or the ground, cutting it open. I was almost knocked out, and I’m pretty sure I have broken ribs. If I had my stomach pumped I don’t remember that either.” The bump on the head can’t have damaged him too badly – after 27 years as a professional in which he had never got his hands on a trophy, he won his next tournament – the Gibraltar Open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/20/the-anti-sports-personality-of-the-year-awards-2022">Continue reading...</a>

When the former president and would-be autocrat announced his third run for the presidency, in the days after the Republican party’s paltry and historically anomalous midterm showing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/19/donald-trump-2024-campaign-republican-party-future">hardly any elected members of his party showed up</a>. Since he left office, civil suits have accrued around Trump and his companies, like a river leaving silt deposits that slowly build up into muddy land. Investigations have proliferated in New York, where the state attorney general has accused Trump of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/sep/22/donald-trump-lawsuit-fraud-allegations-new-york">various real estate frauds</a>, and in Fulton county, Georgia, where his threatening phone calls to the state attorney general in the wake of the 2020 election have earned him <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/second-edition-fulton-county-georgias-trump-investigation/">a criminal inquiry</a>.</p><p>Last week, Trump teased a “MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT” on social media, briefly leading to speculation about what his plans might be, and how they could shake up American politics. Was he announcing a running mate? Was he going to throw his hat in the ring for speaker of the House? But no; instead, he was unveiling a new product: a line of wish-fulfillment greeting cards that depict him as a musclebound superhero. Even worse, the cards were digital only, selling for $99 a pop in a form that’s become the last and most embarrassing refuge of scammers: the NFT. The spectacle was almost sad – tacky and desperate and low-rent, even for him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/20/trump-january-6-committee-republicans-trumpism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is already possible to see why a downcast England team might respond positively to the new coach’s arrival</p><p>English rugby’s sunlit uplands were not immediately obvious at Twickenham on Monday lunchtime. It was a grey, cheerless day, hardly the ideal moment to be trumpeting the bright “new age” that the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, kept referencing. As the rain lashed down and the wind howled across the deserted and damp concourse, it felt almost as if the end of the world was arriving early.</p><p>Inside the West Stand, though, an altogether more heartening scene was unfolding. Christmas may still be a few days away but Steve Borthwick sounded like a man who has already taken delivery of the gift he has long wanted.

She temporarily sidelined the mutant vision behind Pop 2 and Vroom Vroom to work with blue-chip songwriters, nailing full choreo and grinding on her own grave in the video for lead single Good Ones. Fittingly, there are moments of ruthlessly basic pop on Crash: Beg for You interpolates September’s 2005 hit Cry for You and sounds knowingly dead behind the eyes, as any 2000s Eurodance banger should; Yuck is a cute cheerleader chant (and would-be Doja Cat hit) about recoiling from romance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/the-50-best-albums-of-2022-no-4-charli-xcx-crash">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Buzz Bissinger brings to light a most unusual football game on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal during the second world war</p><p>On the Pacific island of Guadalcanal, two Marine Corps regiments enjoyed a rare respite from second world war in December 1944. On Christmas Eve, the 4th and 29th regiments squared off in a football game nicknamed the Mosquito Bowl. This was no pick-up game. The teams included some of the top college football talent in the US, their rosters featuring All-Americans, captains from big-name schools and future NFL players or draftees. Tragically, of the 65 players in the game, 15 would die the following year, during the war’s deadliest battle: Okinawa. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Buzz Bissinger brings this wartime narrative back to public attention through his new book, The Mosquito Bowl: A Game of Life and Death in World War II.</p><p>“I think it was the last time these guys were allowed to be boys, allowed to do something they loved,” Bissinger says. “For three hours – not that long – they got away from training and combat and what might happen at Okinawa. It was joy, pure joy, then back to training.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/20/mosquito-bowl-football-game-buzz-bissinger-book">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young veteran struggling with PTSD finds new meaning in life in this touching and emotionally intelligent documentary </p><p>On paper, this wildlife documentary looks like a slushy sentimental tale of healing and growth. It follows young veteran Harry Turner, who joined the army at 18 and was discharged with PTSD and severe depression after serving in Afghanistan. In the Peruvian Amazon, he finds new meaning in life by caring for an orphaned baby ocelot. (If, like me, you’ve never heard of an ocelot, this little beauty is a wildcat that looks like a cross between a sleek tabby and a leopard.)</p><p>Actually, Wildcat does turn out to be a story of healing and growth. But it’s genuinely heartfelt, made with incredible sensitivity and emotional intelligence by Melissa Lesh and Trevor Frost. It starts with Turner volunteering at a wildlife rescue centre in the Peruvian rainforest run by an amazing American PhD student called Samantha Zwicker. She explains that Harry’s experience of harsh environments makes him suited to the rainforest; most researchers can’t hack it. The two of them soon become a romantic couple. Then an ocelot cub arrives at the centre, found in a tree felled by loggers. The pair call him Keanu and make a plan for Harry to raise the cub to be released into the wild in 18 months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/20/wildcat-review-heartfelt-redemption-story-for-human-and-ocelot">Continue reading...</a>

## Lady Wray: Piece of Me review – sublime retro-soul

<p><strong>Big Crown Records</strong><br />Missy Elliott’s former protege has been criminally neglected, as this slept-on album blending everything from gospel to boom-bap shows</p><p>Never mind just the albums we missed this year, Lady Wray has had a career of them. The American singer was the first artist that Missy Elliott signed to her label, The Goldmind Inc, back in 1997. But after a promising start – including guesting on Elliott’s gamechanging debut Supa Dupa Fly – Wray’s second album got scrapped. Subsequent signings to hip-hop heavyweight labels Roc-A-Fella, then Def Jam ended in another shelved release. In 2012, she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/23/new-band-lady">formed a duo with British vocalist Terri Walker</a>, who quit during their album tour. Now this, Wray’s sublime third solo turn, has been sparsely covered.</p><p>It’s a true crime. Piece of Me is classy retro-soul shot through with the gospel of her southern churchgoing childhood and the delicious boom-bap thwack of 90s R&amp;B – where Mary J Blige meets Bill Withers. Through It All is a roll-the-windows-down head-nodder of the highest order; a song so sweetly triumphant and glowy that they should install it in sunrise alarm clocks. And her formerly homeless father features on more dramatic, redemptive Beauty in the Fire. None of it is overblown, the production still raw enough to crackle off the vinyl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/lady-wray-piece-of-me-review-sublime-retro-soul">Continue reading...</a>

## Providing US Patriot missiles could transform Ukraine’s defences. But it’s a move with risks | Jack Watling

<p>By providing key systems to defend against Russia, the west risks weakening its deterrence posture towards China</p><p>The Biden administration has crossed a new line in its support for Ukraine, by indicating its willingness to send Patriot air and missile defence systems to aid in the war against Russia. The system – which includes powerful missile interceptors and radar – is likely to prove highly effective for Ukraine, and marks a significant step forward in the scope and complexity of the US’s support. But the gift of such prestige systems will present longer-term challenges for Nato.</p><p>Joe Biden previously ruled out sending Patriot systems to Ukraine. The shift in policy appears to have arisen from Russia’s extensive targeting of Ukraine’s civilian critical national infrastructure, which has left much of the country <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/16/russia-begins-mass-air-strike-in-apparent-move-to-destroy-ukraines-power-grid">without power</a>.

<p>She says she has wanted me for ‘decades’, while I’m finally enjoying life after an abusive relationship. Would it be wrong to embrace this chance of happiness?</p><p><strong>I’m a ma</strong><strong>n in my late 50s who recently </strong><strong>came out of a </strong><strong>long</strong><strong>, abusive relationship. My brother</strong><strong> </strong><strong>died last year and, after a </strong><strong>family get-together, his widow came on to me very strongly. After so much unhappiness, I loved </strong><strong>the attention</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>which ended in some sex play and, after returning to our</strong><strong> homes in different countries, some pretty intense sexting. She</strong><strong> says that she has wanted me for </strong><strong>“decades”</strong><strong>, but I just </strong><strong>don’t know what to think about that. It is obvious that she wants more from me</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Although I </strong><strong>delight in her company, feel relaxed in her presence and have</strong><strong> enjoyed the sex play and sexting,</strong><strong> I have no clue what to do next. </strong><strong>Neither of us </strong><strong>has any idea how our families</strong><strong> might react if they knew what we ha</strong><strong>d done. That aside, we live so far apart that it would be difficult to make a relationship last</strong><strong>. How can something feel so comfortable and right but at the same time so wrong and unworkable?</strong></p><p>When eroticism develops between bereaved people there can be an underlying reason – to maintain ties with the person who is recently deceased. It is not uncommon for such feelings to arise, and the sexual spark is always inflamed when there is something forbidden about the liaison. In fact, every obstacle you have mentioned is enhancing the heat of this relationship. I hear that family may disapprove (in itself, hiding ignites passion) but in reality, what’s the harm? It is clearly making both of you feel better – at least in the short term. You are already aware of practical considerations. Just try not to lose sight of those.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>With its wooden script and earnest tone, Tsui Hark’s government-sanctioned Chinese war epic may not win many hearts and minds</p><p>War is hell and so is a certain type of war movie: bloated, self-important and glassy-eyed with solemn patriotism. Directed by action veteran Tsui Hark, The Battle at Water Gate Bridge is the giant follow-up to China’s colossal military epic and domestic box-office smash, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/19/the-battle-at-lake-changjin-review">The Battle at Lake Changjin</a>. It revives the tale of how, during the Korean war in the unimaginably cold winter of 1950, the Chinese army took on the US forces in Changjin county in North Korea and forced Uncle Sam to retreat towards the 38th parallel, gleefully picking up artillery and ammo that the Americans had been forced to abandon.</p><p>The first film took us to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungnam_evacuation">Hungnam evacuation</a>” – an event which was for America something between Dunkirk and a foretaste of Saigon – in which many American and UN personnel had to be airlifted out. Now the movie continues, with more of the same mega greenscreen effects: people getting blown up with grenades and run over with tanks, as well as plenty of bullet-time slo-mo and freeze-frame set pieces of battlefield chaos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/20/the-battle-at-water-gate-bridge-review-china-war-epic-tsui-hark">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian leader makes rare admission while in Belarus; Chinese-Russian naval drills to ‘further deepen’ ties</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance</a></strong></li></ul><p></p><p>China says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning Wednesday aim to “further deepen” cooperation between the sides whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, AP reports. <br /><br />The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai through next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by China’s Eastern Theater Command under the ruling Communist party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army.<br /><br />“This joint exercise is directed at demonstrating the determination and capability of the two sides to jointly respond to maritime security threats … and further deepen the China-Russia comprehensive new-era strategic partnership of coordination,” the notice said.<br /><br />Setting aside decades of mutual distrust, China and Russia have stepped up such drills as part of their aligning of foreign policies. China has refused to criticise Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations, or even to refer to it as such, has condemned western sanctions against Moscow and has accused Washington and Nato of provoking Vladimir Putin into taking action.<br /><br />China declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia just weeks before the invasion and remains a major customer for Russian oil and gas bought at a heavy discount, although it is not known to have sold military hardware to Moscow.</p><p>Asked about Putin’s comment dismissing the prospect of Russia ‘absorbing’ Belarus, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said it should be treated as the “height of irony”, given it was “coming from a leader who is seeking at the present moment, right now, to violently absorb his other peaceful nextdoor neighbour.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-says-situation-in-illegally-annexed-parts-of-ukraine-extremely-difficult">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is the couple winning their narrative war against the palace?

It depends where you’re watching. In the UK, Meghan is pilloried as a traitor – especially by rightwing columnists like Jeremy Clarkson and Piers Morgan – but in the US her story plays as an emotional one and commentators cannot tell it without analyzing the palace’s treatment of her from a racial lens. Some Black American fans of the former Duchess see parallels in her story to their own lives.

<p>In a pristine forest in central India, the multibillion-dollar mining giant Adani has razed trees – and homes – to dig more coal. How does this kind of destruction get the go-ahead?</p><p>In a lined notebook, Bhole Nath Singh Armo, a lean 28-year-old man wearing a blue shirt and matching baseball cap,<strong> </strong>drew a map of his village.<strong> </strong>He pointed his pen at the middle to mark the temple where the village deity had lived. To the west, he noted a settlement of more than 200 houses where he, his father and his grandfather were born and raised. Then, to the north, another temple for a female deity. This was how his village, Kete, looked until nine years ago, when it was destroyed by a company controlled by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-beats-tatas-to-be-most-valued-group/articleshow/94255942.cms" title="">a $260bn conglomerate</a>.

## Even England's police want to decriminalise hard drugs – but our posturing politicians won’t listen | Simon Jenkins

<p>Police chiefs’ plan to recommend addiction services would be far more effective than this futile ‘war on drugs’</p><p>The best social reform starts on the frontline. The news that the National Police Chiefs’ Council has decided to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/12/17/first-time-drug-users-will-not-prosecuted-police-chiefs-plan/">effectively decriminalise</a> cannabis and cocaine in England is, for drugs reformers, sensational. It intends to extend nationwide the warning and treatment schemes that have already been piloted in Durham and Thames Valley. Instead of prosecuting users of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine and ecstasy, officers will recommend addiction services (dealers, and those who refuse to cooperate, will still be prosecuted). So far, these schemes have been hugely effective in stopping reoffending and saving police time. This move flatly challenges the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who told the recent Tory conference she intended to take a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/10/no-10-rejects-reports-suella-braverman-could-make-cannabis-class-a">hardline approach</a> to drug offences. The government wants a “three strikes and you’re out” policy that would see drug users banned from driving and losing their passports. This is pure politics, not harm reduction.</p><p>In every sense, the “war on drugs” <a href="https://www.cdprg.co.uk/blog/2021/5/27/how-did-we-let-richard-nixon-declare-a-war-on-drugs-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-misuse-of-drugs-act-1971">initiated by Edward Heath’s government</a> in the early 1970s has failed. British cannabis consumption is at its highest point since 2007, with one in 12 adults admitting to using the drug. Scotland has the highest rate of deaths from drug use in Europe. Meanwhile, the prosecution of arrested drug offenders is falling due to sheer overstretch. This is legalisation by stealth. </p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/20/england-police-decriminalise-hard-drugs-home-office">Continue reading...</a>
