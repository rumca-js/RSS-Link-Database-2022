The code in question refers to “staggered HDR,” which isn’t a technique that Google’s Pixel camera currently uses. The company was one of the first to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13315168/google-pixel-camera-software-marc-levoy">refine mobile HDR and computational photography</a>, taking them mainstream.

While the skin is yet another example of the <em>Overwatch</em> design team really nailing it, players might find themselves balking at the price.

For years, Cruise has operated its autonomous ridehail service exclusively in San Francisco.

  <p id="zCNSX4">In addition to a World Cup and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Lionel_Messi">full set of other soccer (aka football) awards</a>, Lionel Messi has taken another crown: the person with the most-liked post on Instagram. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmUv48DLvxd/">pictures he posted</a> after the Argentine team won the 2022 men’s World Cup have racked up almost 64 million likes. That’s enough to beat the former record-holder, a stock photo of an egg on a white background with a caption that starts, “Let’s set a world record together and get the most liked post on Instagram.”</p>
<p id="hj2Sla">The egg’s record has stood <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18181806/instagram-most-liked-post-egg-kylie-jenner">since early 2019</a> after it beat out a post from Kylie Jenner by racking up 19 million likes. At time of writing, it has around 57 million likes.</p>

  <p id="7JI4Vu">If you’re thinking of buying a new Apple Watch, there’s something you should know about the GPS tracking. Apple has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, second-gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch">SE</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">Ultra</a> won’t piggyback off your iPhone’s GPS signal if your phone is nearby. Instead, all three will rely on their built-in GPS sensors. Older models, however, will still use your iPhone’s GPS when possible. </p>

  <p id="Q3JyeE">3M plans to phase out “forever chemicals” over the next few years, the manufacturing giant announced today. The announcement comes as the company faces a slew of lawsuits over its toxic legacy with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or forever chemicals.</p>
<p id="24OC8h">Specifically, 3M says it will discontinue the use of forever chemicals in its portfolio of products and “exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025.” Currently, 3M nets around $1.3 billion in annual sales of PFAS it manufactures. The chemicals have gone into many of its most iconic products over the years, including Scotchgard fabric protector. In the 1960s, the company also worked with the Navy to develop firefighting foam using PFAS.</p>

  <p id="Bhvan0">Boutique gaming mouse manufacturer Finalmouse has big plans for its first foray into the mechanical keyboard market. Its <a href="https://youtu.be/OIIYxlIEEt0">Finalmouse Centerpiece</a> is an eye-catching $349 keyboard that has a screen embedded underneath its transparent keycaps and switches. The effect is that it looks like you’re typing on the screen directly, while (hopefully) maintaining the feel and tactility of traditional mechanical switches.</p>
<p id="mpa7ap">There’s been at least one similar attempt at this idea made in the past: the <a href="https://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2014/12/optimus-popularis-hands-on-review/">Optimus Popularis</a>. But while the Popularis used its screen (which was only visible through its individual transparent keys) to display useful information like keyboard shortcuts, Finalmouse’s seems to be far more cosmetic.</p>

  <p id="KQwWjl">Lenovo’s latest refresh of its midrange IdeaPad Slim 5 laptops adds the option for an OLED display. But the company is making customers choose: they can either take the vibrant 14-inch OLED screen or a larger 16-inch screen but with a less premium IPS LCD display. These new eighth-generation iterations replace the outgoing Slim 5 in 14- and 15.6-inch options but retain the document-friendly 16:10 aspect ratio that makes these effective office / productivity laptops.</p>
<p id="ok8CpL">The 14-inch IdeaPad Slim 5 might be, if anything, the more compelling update from the last generation. It not only has that OLED screen, but now, it’s also brighter at 400 nits versus 300 on the older one and covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color space. It’s configurable...</p>

<p id="LM4Crg">Here’s the company’s full statement about that:</p>
<blockquote><p id="fU5gs4">The DualSense Edge wireless controller’s operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller because we’ve included many more features within the same form factor and ergonomic design as the original DualSense controller. We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features....</p></blockquote>
