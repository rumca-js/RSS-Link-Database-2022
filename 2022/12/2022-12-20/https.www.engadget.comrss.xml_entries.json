Following a preliminary probe, the European Commission, the bloc's executive branch, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7835\">announced on Tuesday</a> it believes the proposed acquisition may allow Broadcom to &quot;restrict competition&quot; in the markets for network interface cards, fiber channel host-bus adapters and storage adapters.</p><p>Specifically, the EU is concerned Broadcom may harm competition in those markets by limiting interoperability between rival hardware and VMware's server virtualization software. It also worries the company could either prevent or degrade access to VMware's software. The European Commission warns those actions &quot;could lead to higher prices, lower quality and less innovation for business customers, and ultimately consumers.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Commission will also investigate whether Broadcom could hinder rivals like NVIDIA and Intel from developing their own smart network interface cards. Here it points to VMWare's involvement in <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/09/announcing-project-monterey-redefining-hybrid-cloud-architecture.html\">Project Monterey</a>, an industry-wide effort the company announced in 2020. &quot;Broadcom may decrease VMware's involvement in Project Monterey to protect its own NICs revenues,&quot; the Commission notes. &quot;This could hamper innovation to the detriment of customers.&quot; Another concern is that Broadcom could start bundling VMware's virtualization software with its own mainframe and security tools, a move that would reduce choice in the market.</p><p>As one of the larger tech acquisitions of 2022, Broadcom's bid to buy VMware was certain to draw scrutiny. The European Commission won't necessarily block the deal, but the investigation could significantly delay the transaction and force concessions out of Broadcom. With today's announcement, the Commission has 90 working days or until May 11th, 2023, to make a decision. If the deal were to fall through, it would be a bitter repeat of Broadcom's 2018 attempt to buy chipmaker Qualcomm. While the circumstances and concerns were different, the company was forced to abandon the takeover after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-12-trump-blocks-broadcom-takeover-of-qualcomm.html\">blocked the transaction</a>.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/eu-investigating-broadcoms-61-billion-deal-buy-v-mware-234418707.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-20 23:44:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Delta will reportedly offer free WiFi starting next year", "description": "<p>Delta Air Lines reportedly plans to offer free WiFi to all its passengers as soon as next year, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy10by1yb2xsLW91dC1mcmVlLXdpLWZpLTExNjcxNTUyNzg1P3BhZ2U9MSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGRlNzNiMDAtZmJlYS00NGJkLThiZWMtMmQ5YWJhNzYxZjQ0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVeChl7FeVKTkF8hRdRYX19IgZTl1wdlayixcOLRegwO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fdelta-air-lines-to-roll-out-free-wi-fi-11671552785%3Fpage%3D1\">according to</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.

However, the result is still a mess for customers: You might end up with different online requirements and pricing on two legs of the same flight, even with the same airline.

It set up a seismometer on the Martian surface and collected data about marsquakes, which helped NASA scientists compile a clearer picture of the planet's interior structure. Over the past four years, InSight provided data on more than 500 quakes and at least one <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-insight-lander-meteoroid-impact-mars-192030510.html\">meteoroid impact</a>. From these reports, NASA researchers concluded Mars' core is about half the size of Earth's and likely composed of lighter elements than previously thought.</p><p>NASA announced in May 2022 that InSight would likely go dark by the end of the summer, due to the dust settling on the lander's solar panels. InSight had recently celebrated its fourth anniversary on Mars when it stopped communicating with NASA. In <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/insight/2022/12/19/nasa-insight-dec-19-2022/\">a blog update</a> on December 19th, the agency said the following:</p><p>&quot;On Dec. 18, 2022, NASA\u2019s InSight did not respond to communications from Earth. The lander\u2019s power has been declining for months, as expected, and it\u2019s assumed InSight may have reached its end of operations. It\u2019s unknown what prompted the change in its energy; the last time the mission contacted the spacecraft was on Dec. 15, 2022.

They say their BreatheSmart deep-learning algorithm could help detect if someone in the household is having breathing issues.</p><p>WiFi signals are almost ubiquitous. They bounce off of and pass through surfaces as they try to link devices with routers. But any movement will alter the signal's path, including how the body moves as we breathe, which can change if we have any issues. For instance, your chest will move differently if you're coughing.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Other researchers have explored the use of WiFi signals to detect people and movements, but their approaches required dedicated sensing devices and their studies provided limited data. A few years ago, a company called Origin Wireless <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-09-origin-wireless-motion-detection-breathing-rate-sensor.html\"><ins>developed</ins></a> an algorithm that works with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-06-origin-wireless-wifi-mesh-motion-fall-sleep-detection.html\"><ins>WiFi mesh network</ins></a>. Similarly, NIST says BreatheSmart works with routers and devices that are already available on the market. It only requires a single router and connected device.</p><p>The scientists changed the firmware on a router so that it would check &quot;channel state information,\u201d or CSI, more frequently. CSI refers to the signals that are sent from a device, such as a phone or laptop, to the router. CSI signals are consistent and the router understands what they should look like, but deviations in the environment, such as the signal being affected by surfaces or movement, modify the signals. The researchers got the router to request these CSI signals up to 10 times per second to gain a better sense of how the signal was being modified.</p><p>The team simulated several breathing conditions with a manikin and monitored changes in CSI signals with an off-the-shelf router and receiving device. To make sense of the data they collected, NIST research associate Susanna Mosleh developed the algorithm. <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9989347\"><ins>In a paper</ins></a>, the researchers noted that BreatheSmart correctly identified the simulated breathing conditions 99.54 percent of the time.</p><p>Mosleh and Jason Coder, who heads up NIST\u2019s research in shared spectrum metrology, hope developers will be able to use their research to create software that can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mit-csail-coronavirus-patient-monitoring-device-190037775.html\"><ins>remotely monitor a person's breathing</ins></a> with existing hardware. \u201cAll the ways we\u2019re gathering the data is done on software on the access point (in this case, the router), which could be done by an app on a phone,\u201d Coder said. \u201cThis work tries to lay out how somebody can develop and test their own algorithm.

If you die, then you go back to the morning, to repeat the day again. If you last until the end of the day, you still repeat it again. Colt must \u201cbreak the loop\u201d by efficiently murdering seven main characters, who are inconveniently are never in the same place at the same time. It\u2019s also stylish, accessible and fun.</p><p>While you try to figure out your escape from this time anomaly, you\u2019ll also be hunted down by Julianna, another island resident who, like you, is able to remember everything that happens in each loop. She\u2019ll also lock you out of escaping an area, and generally interfere with your plans to escape the time loop. (The online multiplayer is also addictive, flipping the roles around. You play as Julianna, hunting down Colt and foiling his plans for murder. )</p><p>As you play through the areas again (and again) you\u2019ll equip yourself with slabs that add supernatural powers, as well as more potent weapons and trinkets to embed into both guns and yourself. It\u2019s through this that you\u2019re able to customize your playstyle or equip yourself in the best way to survive Julianna and nail that assassination. Each time period and area rewards repeat exploration, with secret guns, hidden conversations with NPCs and lots of world-building lore to discover for yourself.</p><p>Originally a timed PlayStation exclusive, Deathloop landed on Xbox in September 2022.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you\u2019ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It\u2019s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It\u2019s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you\u2019ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard\u2019s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Control</h2><p></p><p>Take the weird <em>Twin Peaks</em> narrative of <em>Alan Wake</em>, smash it together with <em>Quantum Break</em>'s frenetic powers and gunplay, and you've got <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhTWjFGNUZCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTZlNmVkYi00YjM2LTQyOTAtYjVlNS1hNDRhYmI2MDI0YzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb-mT1O2eoop_v7mVo5v6CzIKruanvg2dh0vXqu3y2Tg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08SZ1F5FB\"><em>Control</em></a>. Playing as a woman searching for her missing brother, you quickly learn there's a thin line between reality and the fantastical. It's catnip for anyone who grew up loving <em>The X-Files</em> and the supernatural. It's also a prime example of a studio working at their creative heights, both refining and evolving the open-world formula that's dominated games for the past decade.</p><p><em>Control</em> on the last-gen Xbox is a mixed affair, with the One S struggling a little, but the One X being head-and-shoulders above the PS4 Pro when it comes to fidelity and smoothness. With the launch of the next-gen consoles, an \u2018Ultimate Edition\u2019 emerged which brought the ray-tracing and higher frame rates that PC gamers enjoyed to console players. Although you\u2019ll only get those benefits as a next-gen owner, it also includes all the released DLC and is the edition we recommend buying, even if you\u2019re not planning to immediately upgrade.</p><h2>Halo Infinite</h2><p></p><p>Master Chief's latest adventure may not make much sense narratively, but it sure is fun to play.

The main campaign is more open than ever, while also giving you a new freedom of movement with the trusty grappling hook. And the multiplayer mode is wonderfully addictive (though 343 still needs to speed up experience progression), with a bevy of maps and game modes to keep things from getting too stale. The only thing keeping it from greatness is its baffling and disjointed story, but it's not like Xbox fans have many options when it comes to huge exclusives right now.</p><h2>Forza Horizon 5</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb3J6YS1Ib3Jpem9uLVN0YW5kYXJkLVhib3gtT25lLVgvZHAvQjA5N01HWjdNWT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAU0yzKlrsheJOfWA1l8p0TFSvflXUxXjwv8p8r3gYqNN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FForza-Horizon-Standard-Xbox-One-X%2Fdp%2FB097MGZ7MY\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>deftly walks a fine line by being an extremely deep and complex racing game that almost anyone can just pick up and play. The game has hundreds of cars that you can tweak endlessly to fit your driving style, and dozens of courses spread all over a gorgeous fictional corner of Mexico. If you crank up the difficulty, one mistake will sink your entire race, and the competition online can be just as fierce.</p><p>But if you\u2019re new to racing games, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> does an excellent job at getting you up and running. The introduction to the game quickly gives you a taste at the four main race types you\u2019ll come across (street racing, cross-country, etc.), and features like the rewind button mean that you can quickly erase mistakes if you try and take a turn too fast without having to restart your run. Quite simply, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is a beautiful and fun game that works for just about any skill level. It\u2019s easy to pick up and play a few races and move on with your day, or you can sink hours into it trying to become the best driver you can possibly be.</p><h2>Gears 5</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HZWFycy1XYXItR2FtZS1ZZWFyLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA4VFM1WDRONz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAb2XnfHobrWv0cDvjyMrn9_lxbM-mgMUtdIVJprVNais&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGears-War-Game-Year-Digital%2Fdp%2FB08TS5X4N7\"><em>Gears 5</em></a> tries to be a lot of things, and doesn't succeed at them all. If you're a Gears of War fan, though, there's a lot to love here. The cover-shooter gameplay the series helped pioneer feels great, and the campaign, while not narratively ambitious, is well-paced and full of bombastic set pieces to keep you interested. As they stand, the various multiplayer modes are not great, but <em>Gears 5</em> is worth it for the campaign alone.</p><p>It\u2019s also a true graphical showcase, among the best-looking console games around. Microsoft did a great job optimizing for all platforms and use-cases, with high-resolution and ultra-high (up to 120fps on series consoles) frame rates.</p><h2>Nier: Automata</h2><p></p><p>It took more than a while to get here, but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL25pZXItYXV0b21hdGEtLS1iZWNvbWUtYXMtZ29kcy1lZGl0aW9uLzE3Nzc5NS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX9W98Q0NTHEAWeBajzQBwNuwCZ1SKPDpIaD8BYL-zoM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fnier-automata---become-as-gods-edition%2F177795.html%3F\"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a> finally arrived on Xbox One in the summer of 2018. And boy, was it worth the almost-18-month wait. Nier takes the razor-sharp combat of a Platinum Games title and puts it in a world crafted by everyone's favorite weirdo, Yoko Taro. Don't worry, you can mostly just run, gun and slash your way through the game, but as you finish, and finish and finish this one, you'll find yourself pulled into a truly special narrative, one that's never been done before and will probably never be done again. It\u2019s an unmissable experience, and one that feels all the more unique on Xbox, which has never had the best levels of support from Japanese developers.</p><p>On Xbox One X and Series X, you effectively have the best version of Nier: Automata available, short of a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SpecialK_Mods/discussions/3/1334600128973500691/\">fan-patched</a> PC game. On Series S and One S... not so much, but you do at least get consistent framerates on the Series S and a passable experience on the One S.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ori and the Blind Forest</h2><p></p><p>Arriving at a time when \"Gears Halo Forza\" seemed to be the beginning, middle and end of Microsoft's publishing plans, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PcmktQmxpbmQtRm9yZXN0LURlZmluaXRpdmUtWGJveC1PbmUvZHAvQjAxRENBOFNGOD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kcy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfTOXgeVH-KtGSKk3-IKOPfNlTEvwQjDHoEfrKOVEgq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOri-Blind-Forest-Definitive-Xbox-One%2Fdp%2FB01DCA8SF8\"><em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em></a> was a triumph. It's a confident mash of the pixel-perfect platforming popularized by <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, and the rich, unfolding worlds of Metroidvania games. You'll die hundreds of times exploring the titular forest, unlocking skills that allow you to reach new areas. It looks and sounds great \u2014 like, Disney great \u2014 and its story, while fairly secondary to the experience, is interesting. Ori might not do much to push the boundaries of its genres, but everything it does, it does so right.

Only when a studio is this successful can it pour millions of dollars and development hours into a game. Rockstar's simulation of a crumbling frontier world is enthralling and serves as a perfect backdrop to an uncharacteristically measured story. While the studio's gameplay may not have moved massively forward, the writing and characters of RDR2 will stay with you.</p><p>While Rockstar hasn\u2019t deemed fit to properly upgrade <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>for the next-gen yet, Series X owners will at least benefit from the best last-gen (Xbox One X) experience with the addition of improved loading times. The Series S, on the other hand, gets the One S version, but with an improved 30 fps lock and swifter loading.</p><h2>Resident Evil Village</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXNpZGVudC1FdmlsLVZpbGxhZ2UtWGJveC1YLVN0YW5kYXJkL2RwL0IwOTQ3ODlZUkg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhNmU2ZWRiLTRiMzYtNDI5MC1iNWU1LWE0NGFiYjYwMjRjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfJmstwVEyn8HZv9ZyhLJzF1iav2cmw3ckOJL5JBjx2P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FResident-Evil-Village-Xbox-X-Standard%2Fdp%2FB094789YRH\"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> is delightful. It\u2019s a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game, and while this represents a fresh vibe for the franchise, it\u2019s not an unwelcome evolution. The characters and enemies in Village are full of life \u2014 even when they\u2019re decidedly undead \u2014 and Capcom has put a delicious twist on the idea of vampires, werewolves, sea creatures, giants and creepy dolls. The game retains its horror, puzzle and action roots, and it has Umbrella Corporation\u2019s fingerprints all over it. It simply feels like developers had fun with this one, and so will you.</p><p>A word of caution before you run to buy it, though: This game doesn\u2019t play great on every Xbox. On Series X, things are great: There's the option to turn on ray-tracing with the occasional frame rate issue, or to keep it off and have perfect 4K/60 presentation. With the Series S, while there is a ray-tracing mode, it\u2019s almost unplayable. With ray-tracing off, the Series S does a decent job, though. The One X\u2019s 1080p/60 mode is also fantastic, although its quality mode feels very juddery. If you own a base Xbox One or One S, though, there\u2019s really no mode that actually feels enjoyable to play.</p><h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWtpcm8tU2hhZG93cy1Ud2ljZS1EaWdpdGFsLVN0YW5kYXJkL2RwL0IwN1ozWEw0UVA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhNmU2ZWRiLTRiMzYtNDI5MC1iNWU1LWE0NGFiYjYwMjRjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWqL_CsEamZZyAf5YVE3vj3hqm-qVYtRphiN8Dd_IvgE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSekiro-Shadows-Twice-Digital-Standard%2Fdp%2FB07Z3XL4QP\"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a> isn't just another Dark Souls game. FromSoftware's samurai adventure is a departure from that well-established formula, replacing slow, weighty combat and gothic despair for stealth, grappling hooks and swift swordplay. Oh, and while it's still a difficult game, it's a lot more accessible than Souls games \u2014 you can even pause it! The result of all these changes is something that's still instantly recognizable as a FromSoftware title, but it's its own thing, and it's very good.</p><p>This is one game that\u2019s really not had a lot of love from its developer or publisher, as, despite the fact next-gen consoles should be easily able to run this game at 60 fps, the Series S is locked to an inconsistently paced 30 fps, while the Series X doesn\u2019t quite hold to 60 either. With that said, it\u2019s more than playable.</p><h2>Lost Judgement</h2><p></p><p>This is private eye Takayuki Yagami\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2xvc3QtanVkZ21lbnQtLS14Ym94LXNlcmllcy14LzI5MTA3NS5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGE2ZTZlZGItNGIzNi00MjkwLWI1ZTUtYTQ0YWJiNjAyNGM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbUclKxTgGXlHAtfLZeZ1icGRYZts0EQCyjo_Nj7NVIJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Flost-judgment---xbox-series-x%2F291075.html%3F\">second adventure</a>; a spin-off of Sega\u2019s popular, pulpy and convoluted Yakuza saga. He lives in the same Kamurocho area, the same yakuza gangs roam the streets, and there\u2019s the very occasional crossover of side-story characters and, well, weirdos. But instead of punching punks in the face in the name of justice or honor, which was the style of Yakuza<em>&nbsp;</em>protagonist Kazuya Kiryu, Yagami fights with the power of his lawyer badge, drone evidence and\u2026 sometimes (read: often) he kicks the bad guys in the face.</p><p>The sequel skates even closer to some sort of serialized TV drama, punctuated by fights, chases and melodrama. For anyone that\u2019s played the series before, it treads familiar ground, but with a more serious (realistic) story that centers on bullying and suicide problems in Japanese high schools, which is tied into myriad plots encompassing the legal system, politics and organized crime.</p><p>Yagami has multiple  fighting styles to master, while there are love interests, batting cages, mahjong, skate parks and more activities to sink even more hours into. On the PS5, <em> Lost Judgment</em> looks great. Fights are fluid and the recreated areas in Tokyo and Yokohama are usually full of pedestrians, stores and points of interest. While <em>Yakuza Like a Drago</em>n takes the franchise in a new (turn-based, more ridiculous) direction, <em>Lost Judgment</em> retains the brawling playstyle of the Yakuza series, with a new hero who has, eventually, charmed us.</p><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2><p></p><p>We already mentioned this one but it's difficult to overemphasize how good a deal <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YYm94LUdhbWUtUGFzcy1VbHRpbWF0ZS1NZW1iZXJzaGlwL2RwL0IwN1RGUDdKRkg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZHMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhNmU2ZWRiLTRiMzYtNDI5MC1iNWU1LWE0NGFiYjYwMjRjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbIx13ZjEsaaH0nMgLx2YYuLdPxuDIBtEKFdsJ-lNDuE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership%2Fdp%2FB07TFP7JFH\">Game Pass</a> is for Xbox owners.

Amazon can no longer abuse its dual role [as both marketplace and seller] and will have to change several business practices,&quot; Margrethe Vestager, the Commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7777\"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>. &quot;They cover the use of data, the selection of sellers in the Buy Box and the conditions of access to the Amazon Prime Program. Competing independent retailers and carriers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes opening up new opportunities and choice.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The deal includes several preliminary commitments Amazon <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-buy-box-prime-marketplace-seller-eu-changes-143402811.html/\"><ins>made in July</ins></a>. Among other things, it will rank all sellers equally in the Buy Box, which displays an item from a specific seller so customers can quickly purchase it. Amazon said it will display a second Buy Box if another seller offers the product with a significantly different price and/or delivery time.</p><p>Third-party sellers in the EU will be able to offer their products through Prime without having to use Amazon's delivery or logistics services. Additionally, Amazon will not use any non-public data relating to third-party sellers to benefit its own business, including logistics or creating copycat versions of popular products.</p><p>The final deal includes some additional commitments, such as making it easier for third-party sellers to directly contact their Amazon customers so they can provide similar delivery services to those offered by Amazon. The company will also need to create a way for sellers and carriers to file complaints if they suspect it isn't complying with the commitments.</p><p>Amazon said it disagreed with some of the Commission\u2019s preliminary conclusions. However, it told the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-europe-business-amazoncom-inc-european-union-6d35d298aba32492b927be8f4f069148/\"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a> that, \u201cWe are pleased that we have addressed the European Commission\u2019s concerns and resolved these matters.\u201d</p><p>The settlement applies for five years in most cases. The Prime and second Buy Box commitments will last for seven years. The deal is legally enforceable in the European Economic Area save for Italy. That country's competition authority has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/italy-fines-amazon-for-abuse-of-dominant-position-085244332-085736675.html\">imposed its own penalties</a> on Amazon.</p><p>If EU regulators determine that Amazon isn't sticking to the terms of the deal, the Commission can fine the company up to 10 percent of its global annual revenue without having to find an infringement of antitrust rules. Based on Amazon's 2021 revenue, that fine could be as much as $47 billion. Alternatively, the EC could fine Amazon five percent of its daily turnover for every day that it doesn't comply with the terms of the deal.</p><p>EU regulators brought formal antitrust charges against Amazon <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-reportedly-agrees-to-end-eu-antitrust-probe-192410097.html/\"><ins>in November 2020</ins></a>, accusing the company of abusing its dual position. The Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-eu-amazon-probe-merchant-data-sensitive-advantage.html/\"><ins>opened an investigation</ins></a> over the use of non-public data the previous year.

On top of that, both models have incredibly fast response times of just 0.3 ms (gray to gray). What\u2019s more, they each support both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync while also outputting a dazzling range of colors (up to 98.5 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum). In short, LG\u2019s new UltraGear displays deliver a laundry list of premium display tech with one clear downside: a relatively low max brightness of just 200 nits.</p><p>Admittedly, low brightness might not be a big deal if, like many people, you prefer gaming in dark environments \u2013 especially since you\u2019ll probably want to turn the lights down anyway to make the most of LG\u2019s built-in RGB light strips. You can even sync the LEDs on the back to what\u2019s being displayed on screen, which adds a bit of bias lighting without the need for additional hardware. Another small bonus of having a lower max brightness is that there\u2019s no need for an ABL (auto brightness limiter) setting like you see on some other OLED monitors, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the display randomly getting dimmer when looking at primarily white screens (like when you\u2019re viewing word docs or spreadsheets).</p><figure><img alt=\"The 800R curve on the 45GR95QE-B is even more rounded than many of its rivals and delivers an almost cocoon-like gaming experience. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/40cb2bb0-8071-11ed-9db7-715a36dffcbe\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>The 800R curve on the 45GR95QE-B is even more rounded than many of its rivals and delivers an almost cocoon-like gaming experience.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, because of the size of the displays \u2013 particularly the huge 45-inch model \u2013 text doesn\u2019t look quite as sharp as I\u2019d like. When you\u2019re gaming that\u2019s not an issue, but when I browsed the web, I could see color fringing and a bit of general blurriness when reading stories and headlines. Now, it\u2019s important to mention that color fringing is something that can be seen on a handful of new OLED displays (most notably QD-OLED panels due to their triangular sub-pixel arrangement), and it\u2019s possible that tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/bp2008/BetterClearTypeTuner\"><ins>Better ClearType</ins></a> or an update to Microsoft\u2019s own Clear Type feature could address this issue. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the time to test that out during my brief hands-on.</p><figure><img alt=\"To test its new UltraGear gaming monitors, LG flew in pro Valorant players Com (pictured here) and Jawgemo from Evil Geniuses.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b521d820-8070-11ed-bfc2-458598e97866\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>To test its new UltraGear gaming monitors, LG flew in pro Valorant players Com (pictured here) and Jawgemo from Evil Geniuses.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, while the new UltraGear monitors may not be the best all-around displays for both productivity and entertainment, they look stunning in gaming scenarios. The 27GR95QE-B is the more approachable of the two as it only costs $1,000 (versus $1,700 for the 27GR95QE) and has a better chance of actually fitting on your desk \u2013 at least without you needing to rearrange everything. At 27 inches, it\u2019s also closer in size to what pro gamers use in tournaments (most competitions feature 24-inch monitors), while support for tilt, swivel, height and even portrait adjustments make it super easy to position the display properly.</p><p>But the best thing is just how good everything looks in motion. LG brought in some pro Valorant gamers from Evil Geniuses to show off the new UltraGears and even in the midst of a firefight everything stayed tack sharp which brings me to the monitors\u2019 most important spec: their 240Hz refresh rates. Previously, the highest you could get on an OLED monitor (including premium rivals like the Alienware <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/alienware-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-ultrawide-review-140012704.html\"><ins>AW3423DW</ins></a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vemEvbW9uaXRvcnMvZ2FtaW5nL29keXNzZXktb2xlZC1nOC1nODVzYi0zNC1pbmNoLTE3NWh6LWN1cnZlZC11bHRyYS13cWhkLWxzMzRiZzg1MHN1eGVuLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTc2ZmZmNGUtZjg0Yi00YmY5LTliZDctMTM0YmMxNzc4ODJkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZgZjgD9uqjKky90cQU0D6PZRDrxXSRPk92wtfNnx9vl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fza%2Fmonitors%2Fgaming%2Fodyssey-oled-g8-g85sb-34-inch-175hz-curved-ultra-wqhd-ls34bg850suxen%2F\"><ins>Samsung Odyssey OLED G8</ins></a>) was 175Hz.</p><figure><img alt=\"If you can ignore the moire pattern from my camera, you'll notice some color fringing or rainbow outlines around some of the text which seems to stem from an issue between Windows and the new sub-pixel layout uses in its new OLED panels.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/0a5f8560-8073-11ed-9fe7-36a832985db1\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>If you can ignore the moire pattern from my camera, you'll notice some color fringing or rainbow outlines around some of the text.

However, the issue is that the general rule when it comes to monitors is that you typically only notice a difference in perceivable performance when you double the refresh rate (e.g., from 60Hz to 120Hz or 120Hz to 240Hz) That means anyone upgrading from a 120Hz displays to one of Alienware\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s rivals might not notice a big improvement while still having a panel that can\u2019t quite hit the super high frame rates (typically from 240 to 300 fps or more) that competitive gamers prefer. But with LG\u2019s latest UltraGears, you get the deep blacks and rich vibrant colors that OLED displays are known for <em>and</em> a refresh rate that rivals all but the very fastest LCD screens.</p><p>As for the larger and more expensive 45GR95QE-B, while it has a slightly lower pixel density than its smaller sibling, its curved panel delivers an encompassing experience. Its 800R radius is meant to mimic the natural shape of your eye while wrapping around you even more than more typical 1000R curved displays. The sweet spot for the monitor is about two and a half feet from the screen and it\u2019s basically perfect. You can still see from edge to edge so you get that glorious panoramic view, but it's not so expansive that you need to constantly move your head to spot buttons or icons that might live in the corners. Interestingly, when I asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/c0mtweets\"><ins>EG Com</ins></a> if the 800R curve messed up his aim when compared to a flat display, he said even though it was his first time using this monitor he didn\u2019t have to adjust much at all.</p><figure><img alt=\"LG's latest gaming monitors even feature a dedicated dashboard for quickly adjusting image settings or viewing things like the display's refresh rate. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/0e41d330-8074-11ed-9fb9-5f27bfe27eaf\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>LG's latest gaming monitors even feature a dedicated dashboard for quickly adjusting image settings or viewing things like the display's refresh rate.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from the new panels themselves, there are a couple of other design tweaks I want to call out. The first is that to better cater to competitive gamers, LG is using new feet on the UltraGears\u2019 stands so you can position your keyboard closer to the monitor. But to me, the bigger upgrade is the inclusion of a dedicated remote for adjusting image settings. Instead of having to fumble around with hidden buttons or a joystick on the back of the monitor, you can just sit back and enjoy a more TV-like experience. The addition of a remote is something we\u2019ve seen from other flagship monitors like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-ark-hands-on-specs-price-taking-gaming-monitors-to-a-whole-new-dimension-140056568.html\"><ins>Samsung\u2019s Odyssey Ark</ins></a> and it\u2019s a trend I\u2019m really hoping to see trickle down to more mainstream displays across the market.</p><figure><img alt=\"Instead of relying on hidden buttons or a joystick, for its latest UltraGear gaming monitors LG created a new dedicated remote for adjusting image settings. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f0cd1250-806f-11ed-ab5f-79e4d6eb2aaa\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>Instead of relying on hidden buttons or a joystick, for its latest UltraGear gaming monitors LG created a new dedicated remote for adjusting image settings.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So while LG\u2019s new UltraGear monitors don\u2019t have the best brightness, they\u2019ve got pretty much every other high-end feature you could want on a gaming monitor right now. And with the 27-inch model going for $1,000 while the bigger 45-inch version going for $1,700, LG suddenly has some very interesting alternatives (both smaller and larger) to Alienware\u2019s fantastic QD-OLED display.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lg-ultra-gear-gaming-monitors-hands-on-setting-a-new-bar-for-oled-refresh-rates-153046589.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-20 15:30:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "How Meta flunked its first year as a metaverse company", "description": "<p>A year ago, Meta was riding high on the metaverse.

The metaverse is the \u201csuccessor to the mobile internet,\u201d and \u201can embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience.\u201d It\u2019s virtual reality, but also (eventually) augmented reality. It will also, somehow, tie into our existing social graphs on Facebook and Instagram. But, unlike Facebook and Instagram, it will be interoperable with other companies\u2019 platforms. It might have something to do with NFTs and web3.</p><p>\u201cThe defining characteristic of the metaverse is that you really feel like you're present with other people or in another place,\u201d Zuckerberg said during an interview at SXSW in February. \u201cYou might look at documents, you might look at a website but in the future you're going to be <em>in</em> it.\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg might think this is explaining the beginnings of some grand vision for a future internet, but it also just sounds a lot like plain old virtual reality. Moreover, it\u2019s telling that one of his go-to examples is \u201clooking at documents.\u201d Over the last year, the company has leaned hard into <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html\">Horizon Workrooms</a>, its social VR experience geared toward office workers.</p><figure><img alt=\"Meta's is integrating Zoom and Microsoft Teams into VR meetings with Horizon Workrooms.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/acef1780-48ee-11ed-bc33-294d8da32433\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>When the company showed off its new high-end Quest Pro, it offered up Horizon Workrooms as one of the key experiences optimized for the new headset.

And there are a vanishingly small number of jobs and industries where working in VR is even remotely justified.</p><p>Perhaps what\u2019s most telling is that Meta has apparently struggled to persuade its own employees to use Workrooms. Despite making Quest 2 headsets <a href=\"https://uploadvr.com/free-quest-2-facebook-employees/\">free</a> to all employees last year, a recent push from Zuckerberg for teams to start holding meetings in VR revealed that many either hadn\u2019t taken advantage of the offer or hadn\u2019t set the headset up, <em>The New York Times</em><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21ldGEtenVja2VyYmVyZy1tZXRhdmVyc2UuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJkZTZjZDItMWJjNS00MzY5LTk4NmEtZDYxYTc2ODYxODQ3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAatw5DRRB8XubBl2_SzrcfFbrRtN6flGHLalPOJt_mfE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F10%2F09%2Ftechnology%2Fmeta-zuckerberg-metaverse.html\">reported</a>.</p><h2>Meta\u2019s metaverse is a meme for bad graphics</h2><p>Without a clear vision, it became far too easy for Meta\u2019s critics to seize on aesthetic issues and other problems. For now, the closest thing Meta has to the \u201cmetaverse\u201d is Horizon Worlds, its social VR playground where users are free to explore as their avatar. But the experience of actually using it is far different than the polished videos and demos Meta has shared.</p><p>This was never more apparent than when Zuckerberg earnestly posted a screenshot of his avatar in front of the Eiffel Tower and Barcelona\u2019s Sagrada Familia to mark Horizon World\u2019s launch in France and Spain. The screenshot was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-graphics-avatars-204551743.html\">hilariously bad</a> and quickly took on a life of its own as people mocked the \u201c1995 level graphics.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg's Horizon avatar.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/6f3681d0-7b1b-11ed-beff-bef54caa1494\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>Zuckerberg quickly promised new and improved avatars, and showed off a more realistic likeness of himself, saying that \u201cgraphics in Horizon are capable of much more.\u201d (A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1562821184471040002\">post</a> on LinkedIn, which has since been deleted, later revealed that the \u201cimproved\u201d Zuck avatar took about a month and \u201c40 iterations\u201d to complete.)</p><p>Then, at the company\u2019s Connect event, Zuckerberg promised an even bigger advancement: <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-avatars-metaverse-legs-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-190937062.html\">legs</a>. Soon, Horizon\u2019s cartoonish, legless avatars would be replaced with ones resembling actual, walking humans.

Meta\u2019s revenue has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-q2-2022-earnings-203433373.html\">shrunk</a> for two straight quarters for the first time ever.

Apple\u2019s anti-tracking changes in iOS have hurt the company\u2019s advertising business. And the entire industry is reeling from an economic downturn that\u2019s affected even the largest tech giants.</p><p>At the same time, Meta is undeniably losing vast amounts of money on its metaverse investments. Reality Labs lost $10 billion in 2021, and 2022\u2019s losses already amounted to $9 billion by the third quarter. Those losses are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html\">expected to</a> \u201cgrow significantly\u201d in 2023, according to the company\u2019s CFO.</p><figure><img alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg in what's likely the company's new VR headset.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-09/30db98a0-2e07-11ed-bee1-0e9797d5cf61\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Meta\u2019s investors are starting to question whether all this metaverse stuff is really worth it. The CEO of Altimeter Capital, a longtime Meta shareholder, made headlines when he wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year that called the company\u2019s metaverse investments \u201csuper-sized and terrifying, even by Silicon Valley standards.\u201d</p><p>In the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, where Zuckerberg more often fields peppy questions about the company\u2019s ad business, one analyst also raised the issue of \u201cexperimental bets versus proven bets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone wants to hear why you think this pays off,\u201d he asked. Zuckerberg, who seemed a bit flustered by the question, replied that \u201cthe metaverse work is a longer term set of efforts that we're working on, but I think that it\u2019s going to end up working.\u201d Patience, he said, will be rewarded.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-20 15:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The first weird gadget of CES 2023 is Lenovo's Swiss army lamp", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces%202023/\">CES 2023</a> usually features some pretty eccentric gadgets, and Lenovo is kicking off that trend with the Go Desk Station with Webcam.

The novel begins with Ansel Packer counting down his last 12 hours before he\u2019s to be executed for killing many women. But Danya Kukafka is much less interested in this murderer as she is in telling the stories of three women who were all affected by Ansel in some way. We follow Lavender, Ansel\u2019s mother, as a lost teenager pushed to the brink as she struggles to protect her children and herself; Hazel, Ansel\u2019s sister-in-law who watches her twin lose herself in this toxic relationship; and Saffy, the lead investigator on Ansel\u2019s case with more hidden trauma than you might expect buried just under the surface. But these women aren\u2019t victims with a capital V. Instead, they work to flip the serial-killer narrative on its head by focusing our attention on the fact that, despite everything, they survived. <em>Notes on an Execution</em> is a dark, engaging story with lovely prose and a surprisingly, underlying element of hope at the end of it all. <em>\u2013 V.P.</em></p><h2><em>Our Missing Hearts</em> by Celeste Ng</h2><figure><img alt=\"a feather disintegrating into birds on a blue ombre background. ugh reese witherspoon is vouching for this book for some reason\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eb7d4be0-7b0a-11ed-b2f7-b1f7b48d639d\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PdXItTWlzc2luZy1IZWFydHMtQ2VsZXN0ZS1OZy1lYm9vay9kcC9CMDlRQllDQzNKLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kOC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODQ4NWIwYjktOTE1ZC00NWI5LWFhNmMtOGNhMWZjOWVjZTdmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAX2-cb_N0PxSnNavrBPEm65VY7704CYzJq-vLP1HczFE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOur-Missing-Hearts-Celeste-Ng-ebook%2Fdp%2FB09QBYCC3J%2F\"><em>Our Missing Hearts</em></a><em>,</em> in the grand tradition of near-future dystopian fiction like <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale </em>or <em>1984</em>, presents a vision of our country that feels far too close for comfort. In Ng\u2019s third novel, she writes of a 12-year-old boy named Bird and his father, who live in a United States where laws enshrining America-first culture have been put in place following years of economic and social turmoil.</p><p>In this world, Asians have been made the scapegoat for all of America\u2019s ills; while Asian Americans are still technically free and full citizens, many of them are under the thumb of police and subject to various degrees of violence from so-called \u201creal\u201d Americans. And any parents deemed to be un-America could have their children immediately confiscated \u2013 no questions asked. As in any good dystopia, books deemed unpatriotic have also been seized and destroyed, including a book of poetry by Bird\u2019s mother, a woman who disappeared years earlier.</p><p>This story is simultaneously small and universal. The meat of the narrative focuses on Bird pushing to learn more about his mother and the circumstances of the world he\u2019s living in, and there are only a handful of major characters. At the same time, Ng skillfully paints a plausible picture of an America that\u2019s given in to its worst instincts. Ng has pointed out multiple times that all the atrocities being committed in <em>Our Missing Hearts</em> are things that have taken place in the US or other parts of the world already \u2013 not a comforting thought.</p><p>But as bleak as this world is, the book is filled with moments of unexpected beauty and small triumphs. Perhaps most crucially, there\u2019s a sense that while an extremist minority currently may rule over a more sensible populace, there\u2019s a way out of the darkness.<em> Our Missing Hearts </em>isn\u2019t a light story, but it\u2019s an important one, artfully told by a writer who can deftly weave together a compelling narrative with poignant social commentary. Ng may have made a big impact in popular culture with <em>Little Fires Everywhere </em>(and its accompanying Hulu miniseries), but <em>Our Missing Hearts</em> feels like her definitive work thus far. <em>\u2013 Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2>The Creative Gene by Hideo Kojima</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Creative Gene by Hideo Kojima\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2455a510-7b0c-11ed-9f76-53775b74126e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Simon and Schuster</div></figure><p>Hideo Kojima is a video game designer best known for the <em>Metal Gear </em>series, which popularized the stealth genre and had a plot that could charitably be described as <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWFhTGlMUlZlYVpBIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NDg1YjBiOS05MTVkLTQ1YjktYWE2Yy04Y2ExZmM5ZWNlN2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ1uyqmvS4K5zmySA5s-muAnX_kDKxrdfBypuCiz_Uck&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaaLiLRVeaZA\">ridiculous</a>.

(It was technically published in late 2021.) Instead of telling some weirdo techno-thriller or a behind-the-scenes look at game development, though, this is a collection of previously published essays about the books, movies and other cultural objects that Kojima finds essential to his being. Like his games, it can border on hokey and self-mythologizing, but it is disarmingly honest, personal and anti-cynical.</p><p>In many ways, the <em>Metal Gear </em>games are about identity \u2013 who we are and how we got there. That\u2019s more or less what Kojima gets at here; for about 250 pages, he raves about things he likes with a tangible verve, not to recommend them to consumers, but to explore how they\u2019ve shaped his experience. More than a memoir, though, <em>The Creative Gene </em>is an appreciation of how art of all stripes can spark inspiration in a recyclable process.</p><p>The prose is nothing extraordinary, and there are certainly more essential subjects out there. While you don\u2019t need to be a gamer to get something out of this, having a familiarity with Kojima\u2019s work doesn\u2019t hurt. Still, <em>The Creative Gene</em>\u2019s sincerity and enthusiasm are easy to appreciate in a time of widespread detachment. <em>\u2013 Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel</h2><figure><img alt=\"fields with a moon rising over distant hills\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/59f23b90-7b0a-11ed-bda9-a7723a86e64a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Penguin Randomhouse</div></figure><p>Emily St. John Mandel delivered one of the essential reads of the pandemic when she published <em>The Glass Hotel </em>in March 2020. It was no small feat given she previously wrote the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-teases-station-eleven-071727998.html\"><em>Station Eleven</em></a>, a novel that\u2019s set partly after a world-ending flu. Given that there was a five-year gap between <em>Station Eleven </em>and <em>Glass Hotel</em>, I didn\u2019t dare hope one of my favorite authors would release a new novel so soon, and that it would be as good as her previous works.

The OnePlus 11 will once again feature the company's Alert Slider, which offers an easy way to shift between silent, vibrate and alert modes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-5g-buds-pro-2-reveal-event-date-140054267.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-we-tried-dysons-air-purifying-headphones-121506892.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-20 12:15:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta reconfirms its commitment to the metaverse", "description": "<p>While acknowledging that 2022 was &quot;harder than we expected&quot; for its metaverse plans, Meta remains committed to the technology, Reality Labs CTO Andrew Bosworth wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/19/23516964/meta-half-reality-labs-ar-vr-andrew-bosworth-blog-post\">blog post</a>. To that end, the company is planning to put 20 percent of its total spending toward Reality Labs in 2023, with half of that going directly toward augmented reality (AR) initiatives \u2014 around the same amount as last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/02/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-is-a-joke-not-shared-equally-with-investors\">criticized</a> this year for putting billions toward metaverse projects and seeing a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html\">loss of $9.4 billion</a> from Reality Labs through the first three-quarters of 2022. &quot;Economic challenges across the world, combined with pressures on Meta\u2019s core business, created a perfect storm of skepticism about the investments we\u2019re making,&quot; Bosworth acknowledged.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, reversing course now could produce &quot;disastrous consequences,&quot; he added. Noting that daily active Facebook users (DAUs) were at an all-time high, the 20 percent investment in Reality Labs &quot;makes sense for a company committed to staying at the leading edge&quot; of AR tech.&nbsp;</p><p>While Reality Labs is losing money, the spending enabled Meta to develop &quot;foundational pieces of technology&quot; for the future, Bosworth said. Specifically, Meta shipped the Quest Pro headset with mixed reality and eye and face tracking that have been adopted by developers, creators and builders. &quot;We\u2019ll be living with the benefits of this work for decades to come.&quot;</p><p>It looks like Meta and its investors will need to stay patient, though, as the company's vision for immersive AR glasses is years off. &quot;Our vision for true AR glasses will require years of progress making our devices slimmer, lighter, faster, and more powerful, all while consuming way less battery power and generating much less heat,&quot; according to Bosworth.</p><p>In the shorter term, Reality Labs is working to improve its incredibly basic avatar system, with more news coming in 2023. It's also planning to help Horizon Worlds &quot;flourish,&quot; will introduce a Meta Question Gaming Showcase in the spring and reveal the &quot;successor to the Meta Quest 2&quot; sometime next year.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtual reality pioneer John Carmack <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/john-carmack-leaves-meta-043202664.html\">recently left Meta</a>, while criticizing the company's lack of efficiency. Bosworth also acknowledged the likely arrival of Apple's AR headset and HTC's Meta Quest rival likely coming in 2023 Given all that, Meta likely wanted to assure users and investors alike that the company is staying the course on AR, despite the challenges.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-reconfirms-its-commitment-to-the-metaverse-120640616.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-20 12:06:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Almost 200 nations promise to protect 30 percent of the planet's land and oceans", "description": "<p>Nearly 200 countries have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNBiodiversity/status/1604917261365641227\">agreed</a> to protect 30 percent of Earth's lands and oceans by 2030.
