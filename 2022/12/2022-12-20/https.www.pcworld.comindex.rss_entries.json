This transparent keyboard has a working display under its keys", "date_published": "2022-12-20 18:18:06+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last fifteen years or so, custom <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/835195/best-wireless-gaming-keyboards.html\">mechanical keyboards</a> have been getting more and more wild. From artisan keycaps to super-specific switches to 3D-printed cases, we&rsquo;ve seen it all. Well, we thought we had, until we saw this. The Finalmouse Centerpiece Keyboard features completely transparent mechanical keycaps and switches, resting on top of a fully-functional LCD screen. Why? Why the hell not? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s pre-loaded video skins react to the user&rsquo;s typing, very much like a gaming keyboard, but the CG videos underneath can dynamically shift in real-time as they&rsquo;re built in the Unreal game engine. New skins (free and paid) will be made available via a Steam app. The screen and video run on a CPU and GPU internal to the keyboard itself, with no resources taken from the attached PC. Up to three videos can be loaded and selected on the hardware. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it work? Finalmouse says that the screen uses a &ldquo;Laminated DisplayCircuit Glass Stack.&rdquo; What it looks like is a super-thin, transparent membrane beneath the switches that house hair-like electrical wiring, establishing the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit&amp;xcust=2-1-1440614-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">matrix circuit</a> required for the keypresses to register. It&rsquo;s a remarkable redesign of some fairly basic keyboard components, all sitting on top of the LCD screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 65-percent board is housed in a customized CNC-milled case, with controls for the screen embedded in the side. The keys and screen itself are gasket-mounted, with linear switches based on the BlackInk design. Finalmouse says the board is &ldquo;completely gamer-proof and able to withstand intense abuse,&rdquo; though exactly what that means isn&rsquo;t mentioned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shockingly, Finalmouse&rsquo;s video says the keyboard will cost $349 when it goes on sale early next year. That&rsquo;s a lot for a standard mechanical keyboard, but it&rsquo;s less than the price of a lot of custom, boutique builds &mdash; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black&amp;xcust=2-1-1440614-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a GMMK Pro with all the trimmings</a> comes in at the same price, for example. Note that in order to get that mesmerizing screen, you&rsquo;ll have to give up a few of the premiums associated with high-end boards, like a dedicated knob, wireless options, and swappable switches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who cares? If you want to get those upvotes on /r/battlestations, you&rsquo;ll need the coolest, most ridiculous keyboard around. And as of 2023, that&rsquo;ll be the Centerpiece. Until someone finds a way to let you literally type on water, I suppose. </p>\n\nKeyboards</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439727/this-stunning-4k-monitor-vibrant-fast-and-250-off.html", "title": "This stunning 4K Gigabyte monitor is vibrant, fast, and $200 off", "date_published": "2022-12-20 14:42:15+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like playing a fast-paced game or watching an epic movie on a 4K monitor.

However, in the coming year, the laptop manufacturer is planning for a more sustainable future with eco-friendly ThinkPad X1 laptops. Not only do these notebooks have the latest hardware, but they&rsquo;re also made of recycled materials. This is the first time in 30 years (!!!) the ThinkPad line has gone green.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11\">ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11\" class=\"wp-image-1439053\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-6-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The ThinkPad Carbon line of laptops has long been well received here at PCWorld. In our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/559430/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-review-gen-9-goes-to-1610.html\">review of the Gen 9</a>, in which we gave it four and a half stars plus an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award, we loved the spacious display and the superb keyboard. The Gen 11 takes much of the same design cues as the Gen 9. However, according to Lenovo, the latest iteration is made with recycled magnesium. There&rsquo;s 90 percent of it in the palm rest and 55 percent in the bottom cover. While the sustainability angle is no doubt exciting, let&rsquo;s peek under the hood and check out the hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1 Gen 11 will have the latest Intel Core processors, Intel Iris Xe graphics, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The 14-inch OLED display will have a resolution of 2880&times;1800 and, Lenovo claims, a maximum brightness level of 400 nits. The connectivity options are two Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A, one HDMI, and one 3.5mm audio jack. It&rsquo;ll also weigh about two and a half pounds, making it a capable traveling companion. On paper, that sounds like a near-perfect (if pricey) work companion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1 Gen 11 will become available in April 2023 with a starting price of $1,729.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thinkpad-x1-nano-gen-3\">ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 3</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"ThinkPad X1 Nano\" class=\"wp-image-1439320\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad Nano Gen 3 is another laptop we&rsquo;re thrilled to bits about. Traditionally, the Nano line of laptops are known for their lightweight form factors. The newest featherlight model weighs just a little over two pounds making it incredibly travel-friendly. Like the Carbon X1 Gen 11, the Nano contains 90 percent of recycled magnesium in the palm rests and 55 percent of recycled aluminum in the bottom cover. Even the retail packaging the X1 laptops come in consists of 100 percent bamboo and sugarcane fiber. The specs are nothing to sneeze at, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ThinkPad Nano Gen 3 will have the latest Intel Core processors (up to i7), Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of Gen 4 PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The 13-inch display will feature a resolution of up to 2560&times;1440 and a touch-enabled option. Lenovo claims the maximum brightness level is up to 450 nits. If that number holds true, then you&rsquo;re in for a rather lovely picture. Connectivity options include two Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A, one HDMI, and one 3.5mm audio jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nano Gen 3 will become available in April 2023 with a starting price of $1,649.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-8\">ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8\" class=\"wp-image-1439336\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, Lenovo&rsquo;s ThinkPad X1 Yoga laptops are great for work and travel because of their convertible form factor.

There are a plethora of third-party options, of course, but Microsoft has also expanded its lineup of controllers to run the gamut from practical to lavishly expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most gamers will be happy with a middle-of-the-road pick, those who play competitively (or like to pretend they do) might want a controller with more capabilities. And those on a budget might want to save some cash for PC components and other upgrades.

It has a refined design, comfortable hand-feel, and importantly, Bluetooth connectivity so you don&rsquo;t need to add a new wireless dongle to your PC. Plus, it costs just $60, and often less when on sale.</p>\n\n<p>Pairing the Xbox controller is completely painless. Simply long-press the Bluetooth button on the top edge, and select the controller in your PC&rsquo;s Bluetooth settings. It will mesh perfectly with the controller settings in most Windows games, and there&rsquo;s no additional software to muck around with.</p>\n\n<p>This controller has the standard Xbox button layout, featuring asymmetrical thumbsticks and nicely tactile buttons. The round d-pad is a welcome upgrade over older versions, which had mushy, cross-shaped directional pads. The 2020 Xbox controller has a plastic body with a micro-dot texture on the grips and triggers to make it easier to hold onto during intense gaming sessions. The Elite controller adds rubberized grips and adjustable triggers, but it&rsquo;s also a bit heavier.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason for the lower weight is that the standard controller doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in rechargeable battery. The continued reliance on AA batteries makes it lighter (even with the batteries installed), but keeping a box of batteries handy is less convenient than just plugging in a USB-C cable. There&rsquo;s a USB-C port on top for wired gaming, but it won&rsquo;t charge the controller unless you get the add-on battery pack.</p>\n\n<p>While the Series X/S Xbox controller is recognized in Windows, there are no profiles or customizations like you get with the Elite Series 2.

While it&rsquo;s a little larger than the 2020 Xbox controller, the PowerA unit is much lighter thanks to its lack of batteries. Yes, this is a wired controller, but your PC is probably going to be close to where you game, whereas a console is most likely across the room.</p>\n\n<p>If you can cope with the removable cable and its aging microUSB connector, the PowerA controller does everything the standard controller does and more. For example, there&rsquo;s a hardware toggle right in the middle for volume control, and there are two programmable buttons on the back of the grips.</p>\n\n<p>The button layout is identical to the standard controller, save for the additional controls mentioned above. The buttons don&rsquo;t feel quite as stable as Microsoft&rsquo;s controller, and the d-pad is mushy. However, it only costs about $30 most days, which is half the price of the official controller.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069938/powera-enhanced-xbox-controller-review.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Review PowerA Enhanced Xbox controller</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"3-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-best-premium-xbox-controller-for-pc\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

It&rsquo;s slightly heavier than the standard Series X gamepad, but it has a long-lasting rechargeable battery, which saves you from stocking up on AA batteries. Plus, the hard plastic body gives way to soft, rubberized grips that make for a very cozy hand-feel.</p>\n\n<p>This is a controller that adapts to you. The dish-shaped metal d-pad is more precise and tactile than the one on the standard controller, and the adjustable triggers can speed up your actions in shooters. Both thumbsticks and the d-pad are removable, and the Elite Series 2 comes with alternate attachments. For example, there are longer sticks, sticks with domed tops, and a traditional cross-shaped d-pad.</p>\n\n<p>Pairing with your PC is just as quick and easy as it is with the stock controller, but there is an extra step after that. You&rsquo;ll need the Microsoft Xbox Accessories app to update the firmware and configure the controller&rsquo;s profusion of added features. Via this software, all the buttons are remappable, including the rear-facing paddles. You can even create &ldquo;shift&rdquo; layers that change button functions when you hold one of the paddles. Just because you make a ton of alterations for one game doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re stuck with that layout when you switch to a different one. The controller can retain multiple profiles, and you can instantly swap between them by tapping the center button.</p>\n\n<p>The main drawback here is the price, which clocks in at a whopping $180. Microsoft makes a version of this controller called the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367331/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-core-review.html\">Elite Series 2 Core</a> that costs a bit less at $130. However, this one doesn&rsquo;t come with the extra buttons and thumbsticks&mdash;if you care about the features offered by the Elite controller, you&rsquo;ll care about having that stuff. That said, the Elite Series 2 is only worth buying if you are playing games competitively or like to pretend you are.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398272/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-review-more-of-the-same-but-better.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Review Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-an-xbox-controller-for-pc\">What to look for in an Xbox controller for PC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your budget, you might have to make compromises on a controller&rsquo;s features. But knowing how different features can affect your experience will help you make an informed choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"feel\">Feel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your gameplay experience can be greatly impacted by the build quality of a controller. Mushy or wobbly buttons can be frustrating and cause mistakes in your games. Likewise, a controller that isn&rsquo;t comfortable to hold can be the difference between going out on a win and giving up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"connectivity\">Connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most controllers today are wireless, but there are times you might want to use a cable. A controller that sports both Bluetooth and a USB-C port offers the most options for connecting to your PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"power\">Power</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless controllers need power, and the way you keep them juiced up can vary. Cheaper controllers with AA battery compartments get the job done, but an integrated battery charged via USB-C is more convenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"customization\">Customization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The modern Xbox controller layout is tried and true, and the majority of controllers adhere to that standard&mdash;for most people, that&rsquo;s fine. For those who take their gaming more seriously, features like button remapping, programmable controls, and hardware customizations are nice to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test controllers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s freelance and staff contributors have untold years of combined experience with gaming hardware, and the best way to test a controller is to rack up even more time gaming. We put controllers to the test in multiple genres, including shooters, RPGs, and fighters. This varied gaming experience helps to reveal any hardware shortcomings or latency issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We pay special attention to how, if at all, a controller&rsquo;s unique features change the experience. Some may make games more enjoyable, but others are just a novelty or a waste of money. Our analysis also includes testing both wired and wireless capabilities, where applicable. If controllers require additional software to access all their features, we dive into that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\nComputer Accessories, Gaming</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428779/manage-your-cloud-storage-drives-from-your-file-explorer-with-cloudmounter.html", "title": "Manage your cloud storage drives from your File Explorer with CloudMounter", "date_published": "2022-12-20 08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, we have more data than we know what to do with.
