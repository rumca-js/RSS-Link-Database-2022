The Goat Simulator franchise isn’t new to trollish antics, but a recent ad for Goat Sim 3 took those antics to another level by including gameplay from the massive GTA 6 leak that emerged earlier this year.
#GamingNews #GTA6 #GrandTheftAuto 

The ad, which is currently unavailable, featured a humorous overview of an NPC named Shaun, who describes his duties as walking around in circles, picking things up, and sitting on a bench. The GTA 6 clip comes late in the ad, when Shaun says that you can see him in some "footage that was leaked a couple of months ago."

GTA publisher Take-Two did not find this bit funny at all, and it didn't take long for the company to issue a DMCA notice to take down the video.

In other news, the director of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recently spoke with Game Informer and explained features we can expect from the upcoming game. 

There are a total of five lightsaber stances, including a dual-blade stance and one where Cal wields both a lightsaber and a blaster. A new heavy and slow style uses the crossguard lightsaber, as introduced by Kylo Ren. These new stances will let you hit harder or from farther away, but whether you should use them depends on the enemies you will be facing.

If you want to play a space game right now, look no further than High On Life. 

The wild and wacky shooter from Squanch Games is tearing it up on Xbox Game Pass. Benji Sales on Twitter found a list that showed the new game from Ricky and Morty's Justin Roiland as the No. 1 "most-popular" Xbox Game Pass title earlier this week. The game's own Twitter account re-shared the tweet.

Brought to you by PlayStation Plus. The holidays are coming and there's plenty of gaming to be done. Here's your rundown of everything coming to PS+ this month. 

We’re approaching the end of the year, and for many, that means work is winding down and we get to go home and hang out with family and friends for the holidays. It also gives us time to play a bunch of video games. If you're not sure what to play, then don't worry, we've got you covered with our rundown of everything coming to PS+ this month, as well as our recommendations for games to play with your loved ones this month.

On top of monthly games like Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Divine Knockout, and Biomutant, PlayStation Plus is adding numerous titles to its growing Games and Classics Catalog. Take to the ring in WWE2K22, stop a cult leader Far Cry 5, and hunt some orcs in Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor and War. There are also a number of Yakuza titles joining the Game Catalog, including Judgment and Like A Dragon. 

The Classics Catalog is also getting some love, with Ridge Racer 2, Heavenly Sword, Oddworld Abe’s Exoddus and more joining the roster. We also list our recommendations for co-op games to play with your friends and family over the holidays. Some, like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons will bring you together, and others, like Overcooked 2, might tear you apart, but at least it'll all be a fun time. 

There are new games coming to PS Plus every month, so to keep up to date, make sure to subscribe to GameSpot.

PlayStation is leaping into the world of prosumer controllers with the DualSense Edge.
#GameSpot #PS5 #DualSenseEdge

The DualSense Edge feels and looks nearly identical to the DualSense controller. DualSense Edge lead product manager Tomomasa Mizuno assured me that this was an intentional decision so as to not alienate players who've already spent hundreds of hours with the standard DualSense. If you've held a PlayStation 5 controller before, then you know what the Edge will feel like in your hands. The biggest changes to the ergonomics are the new, rubbery grips on the back of the controller, the two function buttons, the trigger stops, and the customizable paddle buttons in the back.

The most useful additions to the DualSense Edge are the two function buttons located just below the analog sticks. Holding one down brings up a menu that allows you to quickly switch controllers profiles, adjust headset volume, and pop into a menu to tweak your controller settings. The function buttons feel like a natural extension of the DualSense that makes it easier to access key features you're likely to need in a gaming session. Their location makes them hard to misclick during heated moments, yet they are easy to access mid-game.

Like the Elite, the controller, along with the charging cable, swappable stick caps, back buttons, and a cord lock are all packaged in a white hardshell carrying case with a hole in the back for easy charging. Overall, the DualSense Edge feels like a nice option for PlayStation owners that might have been looking at Xbox's offerings with pro-controller envy. For $200, you'll get a controller that has a familiar form factor, improved ergonomics, some new feature options, and a good level of customizability.
