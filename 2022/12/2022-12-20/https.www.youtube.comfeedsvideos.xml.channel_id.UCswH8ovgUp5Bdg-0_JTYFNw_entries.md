If nuclear weapons falling from the sky don’t get you then the microplastics will. As a new study reveals the astonishing level of microplastic particles falling from the sky, research also shows the devastating impacts this is having on our ability to reproduce. Don’t worry though, you’ll be able to buy a baby grown in a lab soon. Nothing to see here. #life #microplastics #lab

Whatever happened to the Nord Stream pipeline eh? Remember when bloody Putin blew up his own extremely profitable pipeline? Well, in an extraordinary coincidence, the US has now struck a deal to double its own gas exports to the UK. Almost as if that was the intention all along.
