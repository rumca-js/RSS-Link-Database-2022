It features a one-take shot that\u2019s basically a panic attack in televisual form. Suzie, made up like a clown and sporting a silver bow so giant it\u2019s closer to a straitjacket, is trailed along backstage corridors of a TV studio by the holy trinity of nightmare entourages: agent, publicist, production assistant. They harass, chivvy, cajole, flatter and break the news that the tell-all by her vengeful ex-husband, Cob, has just gone online. Suzie sweats, swears, tries to detach her mic, and gets a fake eyelash stuck on her first ex-husband\u2019s gold sequin jacket.

55</a></p><p>In the late David Cavanagh\u2019s definitive history of Creation Records, My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize, the 80s indie band Felt are depicted existing in a continual state of luckless disarray. Their hugely original albums ultimately prove influential \u2013 on Belle and Sebastian, the Charlatans and Manic Street Preachers among others \u2013 and provoke a rabid cult following, but everything else goes wrong. Band members depart with alarming regularity, career-boosting magazine cover features are pulled at the last minute, a gig packed with interested parties from major labels devolves into farcical chaos after lead singer Lawrence Hayward elects to take LSD before going on stage. But even by Felt\u2019s standards, 1985 found them in a tight spot: they had just scored a No 1 single on the indie chart with Primitive Painters, but their guitarist Maurice Deebank \u2013 whose classical-inspired filigree defined their sound \u2013 had left for good. For once, Felt\u2019s luck was in. While hopefully putting up an advert in a record store for new musicians, Hayward had been informed of a \u201cgenius\u201d keyboard player who had just left school aged 16. It was Martin Duffy.</p><p>It turned out that Hayward\u2019s informant wasn\u2019t exaggerating: Duffy was a preternaturally gifted musician. He had first appeared on Ignite the Seven Canons, an album on which Deebank also appeared \u2013 but after the guitarist\u2019s departure, Felt dramatically remodelled their sound around Duffy. His organ playing dominated 1986\u2019s Forever Breathes the Lonely Word, suddenly lending Felt something of the feel of Bob Dylan\u2019s mid-60s recordings with Al Kooper. They began releasing a succession of gorgeous piano instrumentals, featuring Duffy alone: the B-sides Magellan and Autumn, Sending Lady Load, which took up most of one side of 1988\u2019s The Pictorial Jackson Review.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/primal-scream-and-felts-martin-duffy-the-gifted-sideman-who-was-endlessly-adaptable\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/primal-scream-and-felts-martin-duffy-the-gifted-sideman-who-was-endlessly-adaptable", "date_published": "2022-12-20 16:21:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "US House to decide whether to release details of Trump\u2019s tax returns", "description": "<p>House committee to make decision after January 6 panel referred Donald Trump to the justice department to face criminal charges</p><p>A Democratic-led US House of Representatives committee on Tuesday is due to decide whether to release details of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, after a years-long court fight and just two weeks before their party surrenders power to Republicans.</p><p>The House ways and means committee is due to examine them behind closed doors at 3pm ET, the day after the House investigation of the January 6 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/19/trump-criminal-charges-jan-6-panel-capitol-attack\">urged the justice department</a> to prosecute the Republican for his role in sparking the riot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/20/us-house-committee-to-decide-trump-tax-returns\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/20/us-house-committee-to-decide-trump-tax-returns", "date_published": "2022-12-20 16:08:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "There\u2019s news, then there\u2019s the Guardian", "description": "<p>As events moved at a dizzying speed in 2022, <em>the Guardian</em> stayed true to its values, delivering journalism that brought clarity, truth, wit, ideas and an occasional dose of hope.

Eartha Kitt and Elvis Presley banging out the horny (Santa Baby) and melancholy (Blue Christmas) pop classics with shades of divorce. Ex-members of the Beatles and their jaunty, war-torn offerings. Reliable and constant, old and faithful; still relatively close to traditional Hallmark card images of people gathered around an upright piano in front of an open fire. They are mainstays because they\u2019re great songs, but also because modern hit-makers have struggled to replace them. Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas Is You is 28 years old. Even Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Underneath the Tree, arguably the last modern addition to the Christmas canon, was released almost a decade ago.</p><p>The problem is that today\u2019s songwriters shoot too classy. Remember Elton John and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Merry Christmas? Nobody does. Ariana Grande and Leona Lewis have made worthy contributions to the modern canon, striking the perfect balance of frivolity and flair like Mariah before them, but they made the mistake of writing songs that are good because they\u2019re good, not songs that are good because they\u2019re slightly off their rocker. Christmas songs fail when they don\u2019t reflect the spirit of the season, pairing nicely with the act of taking a drunk selfie in a paper hat at 10am. Having a buffet of freezer \u201cbits\u201d from Iceland as a between-meals snack. Dad spluttering swear words as he fails to assemble a child\u2019s toy. Violent attempts to tranquillise the cat so it can travel five hours to Abergavenny without getting a stress injury. Ergo, a good modern Christmas song must reflect the intensifying chaos of the world. It must be willing to be a bit crap, but in the right way, and requires a really dialled-up, manic edge.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/do-they-know-its-christmas-why-todays-meek-festive-pop-lacks-the-crucial-chaos-element\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/20/do-they-know-its-christmas-why-todays-meek-festive-pop-lacks-the-crucial-chaos-element", "date_published": "2022-12-20 12:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "I loved those blue Doc Martens with all my teenage heart \u2013 the Christmas gift I\u2019ll never forget", "description": "<p>People expect a young, blond disabled woman to be dainty and quiet.

That aside, we live so far apart that it would be difficult to make a relationship last</strong><strong>.

It is not uncommon for such feelings to arise, and the sexual spark is always inflamed when there is something forbidden about the liaison. In fact, every obstacle you have mentioned is enhancing the heat of this relationship. I hear that family may disapprove (in itself, hiding ignites passion) but in reality, what\u2019s the harm? It is clearly making both of you feel better \u2013 at least in the short term. You are already aware of practical considerations.
