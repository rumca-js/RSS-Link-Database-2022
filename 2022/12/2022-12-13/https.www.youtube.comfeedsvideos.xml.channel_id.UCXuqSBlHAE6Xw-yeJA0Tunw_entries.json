Check out Supermicro's H13 System Portfolio, powered by AMD EPYC\u2122 9004 Series Processors, at https://geni.us/q3l95Jp\n\nFun Fact: In a 2-socket server, you need 4 threads pegged at 100% to get 1% CPU utilization.\n\nAMD's new SP5 socket, and HUGE new Epyc Genoa CPUs are crazy! Using Supermicro's servers, we set a bunch of World Records on a bunch of benchmarks. Intel is gonna be sweating, unless their upcoming Sapphire Rapids platform can magically compete. Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs might win against Ryzen in the mainstream, it's a whole different story in the datacenter.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1473798-the-fastest-cpu-on-the-planet-again/\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba SUPPORT US ON FLOATPLANE: https://www.floatplane.com/ltt\n\u25ba AFFILIATES, SPONSORS & REFERRALS: https://lmg.gg/sponsors\n\u25ba PODCAST GEAR: https://lmg.gg/podcastgear\n\nFOLLOW US \n---------------------------------------------------  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@linustech\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linustech\n\nMUSIC CREDIT\n---------------------------------------------------\nIntro: Laszlo - Supernova\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfxmFU3lWY\niTunes Download Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/supernova/id936805712\nArtist Link: https://soundcloud.com/laszlomusic\n\nOutro: Approaching Nirvana - Sugar High\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsGBSCDwcI\nListen on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/UxWkUw\nArtist Link: http://www.youtube.com/approachingnirvana\n\nIntro animation by MBarek Abdelwassaa https://www.instagram.com/mbarek_abdel/\nMonitor And Keyboard by vadimmihalkevich / CC BY 4.0  https://geni.us/PgGWp\nMechanical RGB Keyboard by BigBrotherECE / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/mj6pHk4\nMouse Gamer free Model By Oscar Creativo / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/Ps3XfE\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------------------------------------------------\n0:00 Intro\n1:03 Socket SP5 Features\n4:07 DDR5 ECC\n5:26 Expandability\n8:32 Power \n9:24 Let's Fire This Thing Up\n10:14 Hyper vs Cloud Servers\n11:21 Put a 4090 \"In\" it\n11:39 More Cores, More Problems\n13:12 Epyc vs Cinebench\n15:17 ycruncher\n17:00 Phoronix Tests\n19:33 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TwfM3s2Wdw", "date_published": "2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw", "title": "CHEAP does NOT mean GOOD VALUE - Budget GPUs Explained", "description": "\ud83c\udf0fGet Exclusive NordSecurity deals here \u27bc https://nordsecurity.com/linus All products are risk-free with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee!\u270c\n\nTry Zoho One free for 30 days with no credit card required here: https://www.zoho.com/one/lp/linus.html\n\nBudget GPUs might look cheap, but they\u2019re more expensive than you think for such low-end cards.
