## Xbox's Lack of Communication About First Party Titles is Backfiring | Breakout
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2OJOR8704M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2OJOR8704M)

This week on Breakout we're taking about Xbox, and how 2022 has been a very quiet year for the platform that's failed to instill much confidence despite all the investment and previous announcements made.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
