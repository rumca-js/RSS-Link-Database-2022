Thanks to Supermicro for sponsoring this video! Check out Supermicro's H13 System Portfolio, powered by AMD EPYC‚Ñ¢ 9004 Series Processors, at https://geni.us/q3l95Jp

Fun Fact: In a 2-socket server, you need 4 threads pegged at 100% to get 1% CPU utilization.

AMD's new SP5 socket, and HUGE new Epyc Genoa CPUs are crazy! Using Supermicro's servers, we set a bunch of World Records on a bunch of benchmarks. Intel is gonna be sweating, unless their upcoming Sapphire Rapids platform can magically compete. Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs might win against Ryzen in the mainstream, it's a whole different story in the datacenter.

Budget GPUs might look cheap, but they‚Äôre more expensive than you think for such low-end cards. When is it okay to buy one, and how can you tell if you‚Äôre overpaying for yesteryear‚Äôs cards?
