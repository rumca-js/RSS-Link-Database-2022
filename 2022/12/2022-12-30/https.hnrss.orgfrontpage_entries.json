The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:<p>* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.<p>* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.<p>* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.<p>I've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.<p>I don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34188734\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34188734</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>",

I know this is common with most people.<p>What are your recall tactics?<p>I do Audio Recording (Phone App), write on tiny notepads, and even use one of those water-proof bathroom-ready notepads. Sometimes, I felt the ideas were so apparent that I didn't write them down or just continued walking. However, the moment I sit in front of the Computer - the best case is that I'm now doing other \"important things\" or trying to knock off the tasks in the calendar, etc. That simple but effective idea I had is gone and won't come back in its form for hours, days, weeks, or years!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185635\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185635</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://streaming.media.ccc.de/jev22/relive/49255", "title": "Write a Wayland Compositor [video]", "date_published": "2022-12-30 14:43:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://streaming.media.ccc.de/jev22/relive/49255\">https://streaming.media.ccc.de/jev22/relive/49255</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185442\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185442</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-intel-nvidia-slash-orders-to-tsmc", "title": "AMD, Intel, and Nvidia Reportedly Slash Orders with TSMC", "date_published": "2022-12-30 14:38:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-intel-nvidia-slash-orders-to-tsmc\">https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-intel-nvidia-slash-orders-to-tsmc</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185389\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185389</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185209", "title": "I rewrote in Crystal my tool to quickly create Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner", "date_published": "2022-12-30 14:20:42+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi all, I just released a new version of https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s that is a complete rewrite in Crystal that is faster, better overall and allows me to offer simple standalone executables. The previous version was written in Ruby, so users had to either set up a Ruby environment, or use a Docker image instead. This is no longer necessary.<p>This is my first project in Crystal and I love it already! It's syntax is lovely - similar to Ruby's - and it's FAST!<p>I would appreciate any feedback anyone might have - if you are a Kubernetes user as well as a Hetzner customer, please give it a try and let me know what you think, if you encounter any issues etc.<p>During my tests I was able to create a cluster with highly available control plane (3 masters behind a load balancer) and 5 nodes in multiple regions in just *3 minutes*. This is the total time to create the resources (servers, firewall, load balancer, private network), deploy Kubernetes to all the nodes, install some stuff required to provision load balancers and persistent volumes out of the box, and install an upgrade controller to easily upgrade the Kubernetes version (I use k3s as Kubernetes distro). I don't think there is a faster way to create a production Kubernetes cluster!<p>Do you have Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner already? If yes, which tool did you use to create them? Would be interested to know more about alternatives people are using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185209\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185209</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://strlen.com/treesheets/", "title": "TreeSheets: Open-Source Free Form Data Organizer (Hierarchical Spreadsheet)", "date_published": "2022-12-30 13:55:10+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://strlen.com/treesheets/\">https://strlen.com/treesheets/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184993\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184993</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/geodesy/international-foot.html", "title": "US prepares to drop the survey foot measurement", "date_published": "2022-12-30 13:43:10+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/geodesy/international-foot.html\">https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/geodesy/international-foot.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184903\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184903</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://authjs.dev/", "title": "Auth.js Authentication for the Web", "date_published": "2022-12-30 13:10:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://authjs.dev/\">https://authjs.dev/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184669\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184669</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://lemire.me/blog/2022/12/30/quickly-checking-that-a-string-belongs-to-a-small-set/", "title": "Quickly checking that a string belongs to a small set", "date_published": "2022-12-30 13:03:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://lemire.me/blog/2022/12/30/quickly-checking-that-a-string-belongs-to-a-small-set/\">https://lemire.me/blog/2022/12/30/quickly-checking-that-a-string-belongs-to-a-small-set/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184627\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184627</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-closes-out-22-with-record-setting-61st-falcon-9-launch/", "title": "SpaceX caps 2022 with record-setting 61st Falcon 9 launch", "date_published": "2022-12-30 12:54:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-closes-out-22-with-record-setting-61st-falcon-9-launch/\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-closes-out-22-with-record-setting-61st-falcon-9-launch/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184564\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184564</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/amy_k_nelson/status/1608447389538418689", "title": "Amazon admits no basis for damages in $1M asset seizure by DOJ", "date_published": "2022-12-30 12:51:27+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amy_k_nelson/status/1608447389538418689\">https://twitter.com/amy_k_nelson/status/1608447389538418689</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184540\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184540</a></p>\n<p>Points: 28</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34184410", "title": "Ask HN: Did TeXmacs' doubly misleading name hold it back for 20 years?", "date_published": "2022-12-30 12:29:21+00:00", "description": "<p>TeXmacs is not based on TeX nor emacs.
