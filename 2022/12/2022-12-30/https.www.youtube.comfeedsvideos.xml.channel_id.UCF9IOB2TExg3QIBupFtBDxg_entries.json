Vaccines\n\n(Robert M Kaplan and Sander Greenland)\n\nhttps://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/why-we-question-the-safety-of-covid\n\nUsing publicly available data from Pfizer and Moderna studies, \n\nwe found one serious adverse event for each 800 vaccinees.   \n\nThat translates to about 1,250 serious events for each million vaccine recipients. \n\nUS, Spain, Australia\n\nStudy to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials.\n\nSecondary analysis of serious adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled, phase III randomized clinical trials,\n\nof Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\n\nResults\n\nPfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest\n\nPfizer\n\n10.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baselines of 17.6\n\nModerna\n\n15.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baseline of 42.2\n\nCombined, the mRNA vaccines\n\nAssociated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated\n\nPfizer trial\n\nPfizer vaccine group\n\n52 serious AESI (27.7 per 10,000) were reported\n\nPfizer placebo group\n\n33 serious AESI (17.6 per 10,000) were reported\n\n36 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group\n\nRisk difference 18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated\n\nModerna trial\n\nModerna trial, vaccine group\n\n87 serious AESI (57.3 per 10,000) were reported\n\nModerna trial, placebo group\n\n64 serious AESI (42.2 per 10,000) were reported\n\n6 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group\n\nRisk difference 7.1 per 10,000 vaccinated\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe excess risk of serious adverse events found in our study points to the need for formal harm-benefit analyses, \n\nparticularly those that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. \n\nThese analyses will require public release of participant level datasets.\n\nFull transparency of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data is needed,\n\nto properly evaluate these questions. \n\nUnfortunately, as we approach 2 years after release of COVID-19 vaccines,\n\nparticipant level data remain inaccessible. \n\nLevel of adverse reactions in the past\n\nThe 1976 swine flu vaccine\n\nSmall increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome\n\nThe increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. \n\nWhen over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu, \n\nfederal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, \n\nnecessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine (2003)\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221528/\n\nConcluded that people who received the 1976 swine influenza vaccine had an increased risk for developing GBS. \n\nExact reason for this association remains unknown.\n\nRotavirus vaccine Rotashield, (1999)\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus/vac-rotashield-historical.htm\n\nThe U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\n\nOctober 22, 1999 to no longer recommend use of the RotaShield\u00ae vaccine for infants,\n\nbecause of an association between the vaccine and intussusception.\n\nThe results of the investigations showed that RotaShield\u00ae vaccine caused intussusception in some healthy infants\n\nWithin 2 weeks\n\nIntussusception increased 20 to 30 times over the expected risk\n\n(Less after the second and third dose)\n\nCDC estimated that one or two additional cases of intussusception would be caused among each 10,000 infants vaccinated with RotaShield\u00ae vaccine.", "link":
