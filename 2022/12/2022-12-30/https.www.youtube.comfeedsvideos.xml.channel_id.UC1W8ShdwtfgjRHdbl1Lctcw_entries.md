I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Germany 1930s before World War II , we can see clearly, what is happening, in broad daylight in these cities: Bremen, Berlin, Potsdam, Danzig, Koenigsberg, Oberammergau, Munich, and other

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,deinterlacing,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
