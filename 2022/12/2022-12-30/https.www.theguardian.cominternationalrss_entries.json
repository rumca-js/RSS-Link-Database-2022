Here, three men who came face-to-face with the striker reveal their experiences</p><p>Few people had heard of Pel\u00e9 before this tournament in Sweden. By the end \u2013 when he had scored twice in the final at the age of just 17 \u2013 he had become a household name. The great Swedish winger Kurt Hamrin recalls a \u201crare talent\u201d who was humble and kind.</p><p>\u201cIn 1958 he was unknown to us Swedes. At the start of the tournament he was injured and didn\u2019t play until the last match of the group stage. I first heard of him a few days before the final, apparently Brazil had a 17-year-old left wing that scored four goals in three games. But I\u2019ll be honest, we were more worried about other players like Vav\u00e1 and Garrincha.<br /><br />We learned that we should have been worried. Pel\u00e9 made two goals, including one amazing volley shot. I was impressed that he lacked the flaws in his game, even though he was so young. However, he was not the best in the finals, it was Didi and Garrincha, but you could see he had a rare talent. <br /><br />When we met a few times later in his career, he was the best in the world. I particularly remember a friendly in Stockholm against Brazil before the World Cup in England in 1966. Then he did something I had never seen before. Directly from the kick off he shot from the centre circle when our goalie stood far out. The goalkeeper barely made it back and tipped the ball over the bar, but the audience applauded and laughed at the bold attempt.<br /><br />He was incredibly humble. The win against us meant Brazil\u2019s first World championship gold medal ever, and to show their appreciation to the Swedish audience in the stands, and to show respect towards us as opponents, they took a giant Swedish flag and ran lap of honour with the entire squad. Also, I know that when he did not play the first matches he sat in the stands in a small Swedish town among the common people. You don\u2019t often see today\u2019s stars do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPel\u00e9 was like no one else. He was a devil! The best of all time for me. He had a lot of personality, he headed well, had a good touch on the ball and, above all, he was a good teammate. He was a fantastic player but also very humble. You don\u2019t always get that combination. He never complained about his teammates, he always encouraged them. I played a number of times against him. He was always a gentleman. Apart from being a great football player, he was also very educated. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth remembering him.<br /><br />When we played Brazil in 1962 they were the reigning world champions and we lost the game 2-0. We knew we would have a tough game and so it proved. M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Pel\u00e9 scored the goals. We held out until the 56th minute but then Zagallo scored and it was an uphill battle just getting the ball after that. Pel\u00e9 \u2013 who else \u2013 scored the second goal, which killed the game. I am honoured to have shared a pitch with Pel\u00e9.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/30/facing-pele-world-cup-brazil-played-against-him-sweden-mexico-italy\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/30/the-style-quiz-of-the-year-from-edward-enninful-memoir-to-john-fetterman-boots", "title": "The style quiz of the year!
