  <p id="mvnhmO">Meta’s throwing more money into the metaverse with its acquisition of Luxexcel, a Netherlands-based company that specializes in 3D-printing prescription lenses for smart glasses. The news was <a href="https://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/technologie/techreus-meta-laat-oog-vallen-op-kempense-briltechnologie/10437117.html">first reported by Dutch outlet <em>De Tijd</em></a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/meta-acquires-luxexcel-a-smart-eyewear-company/">via <em>TechCrunch</em></a>), but Meta has since confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that it purchased the company.</p>
<p id="gZz5bJ">“We’re excited that the Luxexcel team has joined Meta, deepening the existing partnership between the two companies,” Meta says in a statement provided by Ryan Moore, the company’s head of financial communications. While the terms of the deal are unknown, Meta CTO and Reality Labs head, Andrew Bosworth, revealed <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2022/12/boz-look-back-2023-look-ahead/">in a blog post</a> earlier this month that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/19/23516964/meta-half-reality-labs-ar-vr-andrew-bosworth-blog-post">company’s pouring “about half” of the metaverse-focused</a> division’s...</p>

  <p id="3LFoUH">From pirates to spies to kid detectives, it’s a common Hollywood trope: hold a simple spyglass or binoculars up to your eyes, and you’ll effortlessly get a crystal-clear cylindrical picture of what’s going on. </p>
<p id="lcoCsf">That’s horseshit, of course. Unless you’ve got the hands of a surgeon, it’s surprisingly <em>hard</em> to line up eyeballs, multiple pieces of glass, and a faraway subject. Kid Sean was sad to learn that fact. But I’ll never forget the day Teen Sean pressed the magic button that made all the difference: the one in the center of the image-stabilized binoculars that Canon still sells today. </p>

Some of them even work on your Google TV-equipped television with a Bluetooth controller connected.

<p id="BaXOP0">For Android veterans and newcomers alike, jumping into the Google Play Store to find a new game may be overwhelming. (It’s not your fault, the shop’s curation <em>is</em> hard to navigate.) Instead of leaving you alone to find what’s good from the immense selection, we’ve pulled out a couple handfuls of recommendations. All of these games should support touch controls and some may also be compatible...</p>
