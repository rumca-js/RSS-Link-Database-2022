About 40 minutes of that sweet softer Amiga 500 sound from various artists.
Only single art for the whole lot, but it's a great one imo: "FRIEND - Growth of a Legend" by Critikill/Brainstorm^Rebels, 1st at NÃ©voke 2021.

*) I felt that the original version had some patterns on too much repeat. I just made them repeat less. The edit is about 1m 40sec shorter.
