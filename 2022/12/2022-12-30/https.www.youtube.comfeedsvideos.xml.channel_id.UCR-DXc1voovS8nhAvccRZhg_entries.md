I had my family record me before and after major surgery.

I have IBD (specifically Crohn's Disease), and this is the fourth major surgery I've had to try to keep it from destroying all my intestines! In 2018 I had a proctocolectomy, and this year I had a stoma revision and end ileostomy resection.

Surgery can be very rough on your body, so if you're having surgery, try to go into it as prepared as possible! Take walks every day, eat extra protein, and follow your doctor's advice. When recovering, know your goals and recovery milestones and look forward to them. Try to know what you're getting into, and communicate with your doctors and nurses!
