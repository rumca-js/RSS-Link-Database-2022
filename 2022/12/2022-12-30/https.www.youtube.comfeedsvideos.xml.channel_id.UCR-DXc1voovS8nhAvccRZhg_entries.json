In 2018 I had a proctocolectomy, and this year I had a stoma revision and end ileostomy resection.\n\nSurgery can be very rough on your body, so if you're having surgery, try to go into it as prepared as possible! Take walks every day, eat extra protein, and follow your doctor's advice. When recovering, know your goals and recovery milestones and look forward to them. Try to know what you're getting into, and communicate with your doctors and nurses!\n\nIf you want to know more about my Crohn's journey, check out my book, You Only Have Crohn's Once! https://leanpub.com/you-only-have-crohns-once\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nMerch: https://redshirtjeff.com\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/GeerlingEngineering\n\n#Surgery #IBD\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Day 1 - Going into the OR\n00:45 - Post-op technical issues\n02:57 - State of misery\n04:13 - The worst part of recovery\n06:08 - Day 2 - inspiration\n07:41 - OT and Raspberry Pis\n08:19 - Day 3 - Windows doesn't like Argentina\n09:45 - Day 4 - Don't dance!\n12:03 - Barbie, Ken, and a homecoming\n13:29 - Back to the ER\n14:15 - Part of the one percent (not the good one)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SulcWWkhS6c", "date_published": "2022-12-30 15:27:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
