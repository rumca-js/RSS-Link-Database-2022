## Liverpool fight back to beat Leicester as Wout Faes scores two own goals

<p>Liverpool ended a year they will remember with a night Wout Faes would dearly love to forget. The Leicester defender scored two ludicrous own goals to gift Jürgen Klopp’s team a victory that closed the gap on fourth-placed Tottenham to two points in the race for Champions League qualification.</p><p>Brendan Rodgers’ team led through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s early strike and were rarely troubled until Faes sliced two goals into his own net inside seven first-half minutes. Both were easily avoidable and will become established fixtures in any future bloopers’ reel. “3-0 to the Leicester boys,” chanted the away fans. It was one of their better songs on a night when they spewed out the ‘always the victim’ chant towards Liverpool yet again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Ivan Toney increases pressure on David Moyes as Brentford sink West Ham

<p>It would be unwise in the extreme for West Ham to assume that they are in anything other than a relegation battle. Too good to go down? They have heard that one before in this corner of east London and, given that more than £100m was spent on refining this squad last summer, it would not be a surprise if West Ham come to the conclusion that whatever magic they had under David Moyes has disappeared for good.</p><p>There is talent in this squad, attacking players who can make a difference on their day, but the decline feels irreversible at the moment. Nothing Moyes tries is coming off and West Ham, who lie a point above the bottom three after falling to their fifth consecutive defeat, can be forgiven if they are thinking of making a managerial change after witnessing another witless display.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/west-ham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

You know our situation, and we cannot just pick players and put them on top and top and top all the time. We need to collect money a little bit before we can spend a bit, and then we can collect again. So Cody is a very interesting player. He was really well-respected and loved at PSV and we think it is the right moment to put him in. He can play in all four [forward] positions, and that’s pretty rare. He has size, physicality, can shoot from outside the box, has a good nose for finishing, is quick, a good dribbler. There are so many things to be excited about. Usually players develop quite well with us, and he is already really good.”</p><p><strong>Klopp – who is talking to Sky Sports – moves onto tonight’s match.</strong> “Stats are not too important. We lost the last one against them, and I can feel that if I think about it. You see that Leicester had a difficult start into the season like we did, but they found a way into it. Their line-up has a lot of speed, when they play against us they kick the ball long, so we don’t know exactly, we have to be ready for everything. It’s Anfield, and it’s a long time ago we played here. We couldn’t wait and now we have to create an atmosphere.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/dec/30/liverpool-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live-score-updates">Continue reading...</a>

He grabbed the shampoo bottles, the rubber duck and a hairbrush, and sank them in the bathwater. He squealed, delighting himself in some private game. I turned away, picked up my phone, refreshed my email and checked Instagram. Then I scrolled while my son played in the bath beside me, thinking he didn’t want to be observed. When he noticed me on my phone, looking away from him, his smile vanished. He whined and teared up. I immediately put the phone down, cooing: “I’m sorry, baby. I’m sorry.” But he cried unforgivingly.</p><p>My wife, hearing the commotion, came into the bathroom, picked him up in a towel and carried him into his bedroom. I followed behind, still apologising.

<p>Too many designers are unable – or unwilling – to make clothes for women with breasts and bums. Westwood embraced the curves</p><p>The first time I saw a Vivienne Westwood dress in the wild was while shopping for my best friend’s wedding, almost 10 years ago. She told me she wanted something black, not white, something in the sale, something she could wear after the wedding and – turning to face me on the middle of London’s Regent Street, added: “something that will stretch because I’m six weeks pregnant”. So off we went to the Vivienne Westwood store on Conduit Street in London, and left half an hour later with a loose black silk sleeveless pencil dress, with a draped neckline and ruched waist with plenty of give. She successfully wore it, five weeks later and 11 weeks pregnant, to her wedding.</p><p>Vivienne Westwood, who died on Thursday night, could pack more contradictions into one collection than most designers could in a lifetime. But in her clothes, she did the one thing designers are unable – or rather unwilling – to do. That is, make fancy stuff for real people with real bodies, making her truly the mother of all fashion contradictions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/30/vivienne-westwood-clothes-designer-fashion-women">Continue reading...</a>

Do not stare too long at the blank page or screen in front of your or it will become a vortex that threatens to swallow you whole. You are not going to allow this to happen. Instead, you are going to forget about whatever it is you might think you are going to write – a series of beautifully pared-back, emotionally raw stories reminiscent of Raymond Carver, perhaps; or a historical magnum opus to fill the gap left by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/23/dame-hilary-mantel-obituary" title="">much-missed Hilary Mantel</a> – and you are going to do one of the following:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/are-you-bored-yet-maybe-it-is-time-to-write-that-great-novel-here-are-some-tips-to-get-going">Continue reading...</a>

A classic apple crumble will always reign supreme, but I like to switch things up for the festivities.

<p>Your anger is a healthy response, but you must get in touch with that hurt child inside you</p><p><strong>I am a much-loved adopted child. Both my adoptive parents died several years ago. I was told that my birth mother apparently loved me so much that she could not bear to touch me or hold me before giving me away. How could that be an expression of love?</strong><strong> I understand her choice intellectually but it’s hard to face up to the anger I feel. So now I think I’ve turned all of that anger on to myself. </strong></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>can’t tolerate intimacy, and I think that may have been caused by that choice at my birth. I have thought for a while that it is the equivalent of having been deprived of oxygen – the damage is permanent. I have been unable to sustain intimate relationships and it seems as though the more I love someone the more intolerable for them my love becomes – more than one person </strong><strong>has ultimately told me </strong><strong>that I’m too needy</strong><strong>.

<p>The US comedy sensation is making up for lost time after Covid with a new show – still self-obsessed, but ‘a bit darker’ – and an opportunity for us to observe a quintessentially millennial comic grow up in public</p><p>As long as there has been standup, comics have had to decide how to be themselves on stage. But now, a generation has emerged who – thanks to social media – have been performing in public, even while establishing their actual identities, since adolescence. The fallout from that process is spawning much of today’s best comedy, Catherine Cohen’s very much included. Cohen’s maiden set The Twist …? She’s Gorgeous was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/catherine-cohen-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019" title="">the standout show of 2019</a>, on which she was all set to capitalise when the global pandemic struck. Now she is back, with a show that should reveal what the self-obsessed comedy of an Insta-addled twentysomething looks like when its creator inches into their 30s.</p><p>The answer – spoiler alert! – is that Cohen, now 31, still has “the same bravado and obsession with myself and with glamour at all costs”. Such are the qualities she brought three summers ago from New York City, where she was known for her weekly cabaret slot at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-cumming">Alan Cumming</a>’s Manhattan nightclub, to the Edinburgh fringe – from which she sashayed off with a slam-dunk best newcomer prize. I met her at the time, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/20/catherine-cohen-edinburgh-star-millennial-comic-fringe" title="">in conversation</a> she was playful and highly self-aware, invisible air quotes lingering around her every utterance. Great fun, in other words – if not as much fun as that debut show, The Twist …, a performance with so much star power it left scorch marks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/30/comedian-catherine-cohen-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fashion designer who from punk origins created an international brand with a dissident edge</p><p>No fashion designer ever had a Paris show like the one staged by Vivienne Westwood in 1991. Although she was by then 50 and had been making clothes for sale for 20 years – and the British Fashion Council had named her designer of the year – she stitched much of that collection on her own sewing machine in her shabby south London flat, hand-finishing it in the van that transported her, and the models, to France, where the couturier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/20/azzedine-alaia-obituary">Azzedine Alaïa</a> had invited her to guest-show. Despite those limitations, the collection was a major success.</p><p>The life of Westwood, who has died aged 81, was like that, both rackety and responsible. She went on behaving as an eternal student, although she had dropped out after one term at Harrow Art School because, as a working-class teen, she had no idea how to make a living from art. She was candid with biographers and interviewers that her real, worldly education came from relationships, usually with men for whom she was the practical back-up, paying the bills or totting up the till receipts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/30/dame-vivienne-westwood-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Reims’ 3-1 win over Rennes on Thursday night was their eighth match in a row without defeat, a run that has coincided with the installation of Will Still as their manager. Some of the games in that run have been against the league’s lesser lights – and Reims were not majorly disrupted by the World Cup, with only Junya Ito playing in Qatar – but the evidence of the young manager’s positive influence continues apace.</p><p>This was always likely to be a challenging season for Reims, with the club’s recent signings being rather hit or miss. Ito has hit the ground running, but players such as Valon Berisha, Anastasios Donis and Kaj Sierhuis have been rather expensive missteps. The club’s academy has produced a decent level of talent, including Hugo Ekitiké, Axel Disasi and Alexis Flips, but a mass exodus in the summer looked to have severely weakened their chances of extending their stay in Ligue 1.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/will-still-football-manager-preston-ligue-1-reims">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak presides over a party still bitterly divided over what was the biggest mistake in the year of three prime ministers</p><p>There is a Labour attack video from October that best sums up 2022 for the Tories. Released on the night that chaos consumedthe House of Commons over a vote on fracking that prompted Liz Truss to resign the next day, it didn’t require much work from aides at party headquarters. Instead, they simply tweeted out a television interview with a Conservative politician and titled it: “This is what Tory MPs think of their own government.” The MP in question – Charles Walker – goes on to decry the situation his party has created as a “shambles”, a “disgrace” and “utterly appalling”.</p><p>It reflects how the past 12 months have played out in British politics. The Conservative government has rattled through three prime ministers, four chancellors, five byelection losses and only narrowly avoided economic collapse.

The band’s three members – vocalist and guitarist Echo Marshall, drummer Lu Racine and bass player Nathaniel van Osdol – had all moved to the small Vermont town of Brattleboro independently. They met in what they have described as “a small community of freaks” centring around a local arts collective, and the seeds of the band were planted when Marshall was invited by a fellow musician to jam in a silk screen print shop owned by Racine. The latter’s interest was piqued by Marshall’s choice of headgear: “I had a ridiculous hat on,” Marshall remembers, “and I had no idea what I was doing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/30/new-music-for-2023-thus-love-the-small-town-trio-post-punk-pop">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A piece of footballing art’: six memorable moments from Pelé’s career

<p>We pick out six of the Brazilian’s most unforgettable matches, from a quick impact against the USSR to a farewell free-kick</p><p>The young Pelé knew how to make a first impression. He scored four goals on his unofficial debut for Santos. He scored one on his official club debut, his goal-tending victim very much looking at his fate through the prism of a glass half full, later making a business card announcing his status as the keeper who conceded Pelé’s first. He scored within minutes of coming on for his first Brazil cap. But the true harbinger came in Brazil’s third group game of the 1958 World Cup. Thought too callow by some of Brazil’s coaching staff, Pelé and Garrincha sat on the sidelines as they watched the team beat Austria and draw 0-0 with England, the latter the first time the <em>Seleção</em> had failed to score in a World Cup game. That relative failure was enough to force the hand of the coach, Vicente Feola. He threw in the inexperienced duo and after 40 seconds Garrincha hit a post. One minute later, so did Pelé. The woodwork wasn’t the only thing rattled: the USSR team, one of the pre-tournament favourites, were so discombobulated they shipped a goal to Vavá another 60 seconds later. “The greatest three minutes of football ever played,” said the L’Équipe journalist Gabriel Hanot, the founder of the European Cup. The most epochal, too, given what Pelé and Brazil would get up to during the next dozen years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/pele-memorable-moments-from-his-career">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Storms followed months of heavy rain on the North Island, while temperatures in France and Spain rose to almost 20C</p><p>Over the Christmas period, the upper North Island of New Zealand experienced stormy conditions, grounding flights and flooding roads. Thunderstorms broke out on 22 December, leading to heavy rainfall and an incredible 4,500 lightning strikes in just two hours. Unfortunately, one of these lightning strikes set a property alight in the town of Waitōtara in the south of the island. Although no injuries were reported, the property and surrounding farmlands were mostly destroyed. Furthermore, a small tornado was spotted in the Southland region of the South Island, though thankfully, no damage was caused.</p><p>Although there were long sunny spells on Christmas Day, thunderstorms arose once more on Boxing Day. Between 2pm and 7pm local time, about 25-40mm fell over the upper North Island, although one rain gauge in the Auckland suburb of Ōtāhuhu recorded 50mm in just one hour. Parts of the motorway close to Mount Wellington were consequently closed, and several flights grounded. This excessive rainfall comes after several months of above average precipitation for the area, which exacerbated the risk of ground flooding and landslides.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/30/weather-tracker-floods-and-a-tornado-hit-new-zealand-as-europe-heats-up">Continue reading...</a>

Before leaving, he entrusted one of his most treasured possessions to his friend Georges Bataille, who hid it the archives of the French national library. This was a work titled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/19/germany-europes-greatest-artistic-nation-richter-klee-dix-hoch">Angelus Novus</a>, by the artist Paul Klee. The print is of a small angel, wings outstretched, and Benjamin describes how the angel’s “face is turned toward the past”, where he sees history as “one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage”.</p><p>More than 80 years after Benjamin described the unending storm of the early 20th century through the look of an angel in a painting, the Collins English Dictionary has come to a similar conclusion about recent history.

<p>The government wants to lease offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico – but the oil industry wants it for its own needs</p><p>Offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico proposed by the Biden administration could generate enough electricity for 3.1m homes in Texas and Louisiana. But industry is eyeing the potential for offshore wind farms to instead <a href="https://h2thefuture.org/hydrogen/">power</a> oil refining, steel and fertilizer manufacturing and other industrial processes.</p><p>The administration has committed to building 30 gigawatts of offshore wind to power 10m homes nationally by 2030 to help boost renewable energy in the country. But multiple companies interested in leasing offshore parcels in the Gulf of Mexico want to use that energy to make renewable hydrogen to power industrial processes to reduce their carbon footprint. The so-called “green” hydrogen could be sent to shore via the gulf’s existing extensive oil and gas pipeline network and replace traditional hydrogen made from fossil fuels. Green hydrogen could <a href="https://h2thefuture.org/hydrogen/">reduce</a> the state’s carbon emissions by as much as 68% and spark an industrial revolution, according to proponents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/30/how-ocean-wind-power-could-help-the-oil-industry">Continue reading...</a>

## Joanna Scanlan: ‘There’s a rageful power in me ready to be unleashed’

<p>She spent years in under-the-radar parts, but since winning a Bafta for After Love, Joanna Scanlan is loving life as a leading lady, tackling the Welsh language, and playing roles with ‘real welly’</p><p>When the actor Joanna Scanlan was four years old, she had an epiphany. She recalls standing on stage at her north Wales convent school reciting a poem and “in that moment feeling transported to another realm of existence. I remember thinking: ‘I prefer it here.’ The reality is that I still feel that way. As much as I love my life, I do prefer to be in the realm of the imagination. It is the place where I am my truest self.”</p><p>Scanlan, who is 61, is installed in a meeting room at her publicist’s office in Soho, London. It has been a long morning of interviews, but if she is tired of talking she is too nice to show it; her default setting is sunny and self-effacing. She is here to discuss The Light in the Hall, a psychological thriller set in Carmarthenshire which has been shot in English and Welsh (Scanlan learned her lines with the help of her Welsh-speaking niece). She plays Sharon, whose teenage daughter, Ela, was murdered 18 years ago. A local gardener, Joe Pritchard (Game of Thrones’ Iwan Rheon) was convicted of the crime, but never revealed why he did it or what he did with the body. When he is released on parole, Sharon determines to find out what happened to her child.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/30/joanna-scanlan-light-in-the-hall-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will 2023 be the year for Jersey drill or post-hyperpop? We look at the new pop genres about to burst through to the mainstream</p><p>They say that genre is dead, and they’re kind of right. We are getting used to a world without pop tribalism, where emos, punks and pop kids all sit at the same lunch table, and where playlists are sorted by mood more than sound. Yet even in this era of sonic slowdown, new styles continue to sprout up from strange corners of the internet and globalised communities. From niche dance styles blowing up on Nigerian TikTok to e-girls making Auto-Tuned punk in their bedrooms, there are still plenty of weird new genres to go around – they’re just not as easily organised into HMV’s racks and dividers (ask your parents). In a foolhardy attempt at taxonomy that will infuriate both artists and fans – as is traditional – here we have identified five of the most exciting new genres ready to blow up in 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/30/new-music-genres-for-2023">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Now The Way of Water has passed the billion-dollar mark, a seven-movie franchise seems inevitable – with stars, settings and storylines in the bank</p><p><strong>SPOILER WARNING: This article discusses Avatar: The Way of Water in detail</strong></p><p>Not everybody is profoundly in love with Pandora, the lush and verdant forest moon that James Cameron brought back to multiplexes with the long-delayed Avatar: The Way of Water. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron">called it</a> “a soggy, twee, trillion-dollar screensaver”. And if you scan through the comment sections of most pieces about the film it is clear that many were hoping to see it die a death at the box office, with Cameron’s plans for another five movies going with it. After all, it has been reported that The Way of Water needs to make $2bn just to cover its costs and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/james-cameron-avatar-15-avatar-5">the Canadian director himself recently told Vanity Fair</a>: “Let’s face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don’t make enough money, there’s not going to be a 4 and 5.”</p><p>Unfortunately for those naysayers, the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64115028">reported this week</a> that The Way of Water has passed $1bn at the global box office in only 14 days, the fastest movie of 2022 to pass the landmark. You don’t get these kind of figures without the sort of <a href="https://movieweb.com/rotten-tomatoes-avatar-the-way-of-water/">word-of-mouth</a> that is likely to see The Way of Water become one of the highest-grossing films of the post-pandemic era.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/30/avatar-franchise-part-three-the-way-of-water">Continue reading...</a>

## Wrestling tigers and hurling motorcycles: how SS Rajamouli’s RRR cast a spell over the world

<p>The Indian director was as surprised as anyone that his astonishingly larger than life, logic-defying action film has found a huge global audience. So is Hollywood on the horizon?</p><p>Looking at the box-office numbers when RRR first opened in the US in March, director SS Rajamouli couldn’t believe the film was really breaking through to non-Indian audiences. “We thought, OK, this might be [American] friends who the Indians had dragged along to see the movie,” he says. “But as the numbers started increasing, and appreciation started coming from celebrities, critics, influencers, gamers, from people of repute, I think it gradually dawned on us that this had the capacity to become much bigger than any other Indian film that has gone before.”</p><p>Everything about RRR – the story of two freedom fighters in British-ruled 1920s India – is larger than life. Not just because of the box-office numbers (it is currently the third-highest grossing film ever in India; Rajamouli’s 2017 action film Baahubali 2 is the highest), the budget (at $69m, India’s most expensive film ever) or the length of the shoot (320 days over three years, with Covid interruptions), but also the epic tenor of the movie’s action. Men wrestle tigers and hurl motorcycles, entire armies are single-handedly subdued, the dance scenes are supercharged. Stylised, CGI-heavy, logic-defying, yet ingeniously choreographed and meticulously composed, it feels like something fresh and invigorating, especially compared to Hollywood’s samey output.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/30/wrestling-tigers-and-hurling-motorcycles-how-ss-rajamoulis-rrr-cast-a-spell-over-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brightly lit Kali Puja marquee was made to look like an identity card for the goddess – complete with a heavenly address  </p><p>This photo of a <em>pandal</em> or marquee was taken on my phone from the car window as we passed through Dover Terrace in south Kolkata, India. Dover Terrace is a middle- and upper-middle-class area, but just over here there’s a slum. So the <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/kali-puja/">Kali Puja</a> festivities, which this marquee was at the centre of, were primarily participated in by working-class people who anyway treat parts of the road as their drawing room, so that cars need to negotiate this brief, congested stretch regardless of whether it’s hosting festivities. </p><p>The main festival in West Bengal is not Kali Puja but Durga Puja, which takes place in late September or early October. It celebrates the mother goddess Durga’s advent with her children into the world for a week, after which she returns to Kailash (the peak in the Himalayas where she lives with her husband, Shiva). She’s visiting her father’s house, and then, like all married women, must return to the house she shares with her husband. The festival’s other mythic narrative has to do with Durga <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/learning/short-story-birth-durga-battle-mahishasur-5391513/">vanquishing a demon</a>, Mahishasura, who threatens to destroy the world; Durga, 10-armed, and bearing weapons, rides a lion and tramples the demon underfoot. The festival is a mix of triumphal adoration (Durga’s victorious slaying of the demon) and, increasingly, as it draws to a close, a sense of valediction (the daughter must, again, leave the house she grew up in).</p><p>Amit Chaudhuri is the author of eight novels, including Sojourn; his nonfiction works include Finding the Raga<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/30/kolkata-ancient-festivals-kali-puja-modern-mix-of-myth-and-politics">Continue reading...</a>

But none of us are entirely powerless</p><p>Being alive has felt like a strange business in recent years (though vastly better than the alternative, of course). I do my frivolous job, try to get my five a day, and fret about money, who is more successful than me and whether I should find out what retinol is. But all that mental busywork is shaded by the silhouette of some giant predator, maw open, claws raised, ready to pounce. In my head it’s like a cartoon image, but not funny.</p><p>In a cartoon, I’d be oblivious, but I’m not; quite the opposite. I know we’re living in the shadow of climate collapse, and I know, too, how lucky I am to be insulated from the worst of what is already happening worldwide. But my ordinary joys and worries have started feeling ridiculous since things are so bad. “Things are bad.” “The world is on fire … ” That’s how I tend to talk about it on the rare occasions that I do – euphemistically or with jokey hyperbole, to conceal the real constant hum of dread.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/fear-climate-catastrophe-thing-ill-do-differently">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The world No 1 led all the way in the Rapid, scoring 10/13 with some classic wins, before arriving late for round one of the Blitz and playing the whole 59 moves with only 30 seconds on his clock</p><p>Magnus Carlsen scored another triumph on Wednesday when the 32-year-old No 1 won the World Rapid title in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The Norwegian’s 10/13 total was half a point ahead of Germany’s Vincent Keymer in second place and the US champion, Fabiano Caruana, in third. </p><p>Carlsen has been the dominant player in World Rapids for more than a decade, showing an impressively high quality of play at a fast time limit. Rapid is 15 minutes per player for the entire game, plus a 10 seconds per move increment. Since 2012 he has won four golds, a silver, and two bronze medals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/30/chess-carlsen-triumphs-in-world-rapid-then-sprints-to-avoid-blitz-time-forfeit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was 1970 and when a TV comes into your kitchen, with Pelé inside, that marks you for life. I cried with emotion</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/pele-brazil-dies-football-legend">Pelé</a> is an idea of perfection for me. The relationship you have with football depends in part on your age of discovery, and television came into my home with the Mexico World Cup in 1970. I was 14 years old and my mum gave me this gift, a homage, of buying a television set so that I could watch the World Cup, alone in the kitchen at home. When a television comes into the kitchen of your home, with Pelé inside, that marks you for life. I cried with emotion, with happiness, because of that Brazil team.</p><p>Not long ago I watched a documentary about Pelé that was very focused on the 1970 World Cup. At the end, he said that when the tournament came to an end and he was in the dressing room, he cried because he felt that he had finally lifted from his shoulders the weight of the whole of Brazil. And watching that, I couldn’t help feeling that I was there at home crying from happiness because of what this guy had done for us, and there he was at the same time, but also crying with anguish because he had finally been liberated from the pressure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/30/pele-was-a-lovely-man-and-the-idea-of-perfection-for-me">Continue reading...</a>

## Facing Pelé: what it was like by those who played against him

<p>The Brazilian won the World Cup three times. Here, three men who came face-to-face with the striker reveal their experiences</p><p>Few people had heard of Pelé before this tournament in Sweden. By the end – when he had scored twice in the final at the age of just 17 – he had become a household name. The great Swedish winger Kurt Hamrin recalls a “rare talent” who was humble and kind.</p><p>“In 1958 he was unknown to us Swedes. At the start of the tournament he was injured and didn’t play until the last match of the group stage. I first heard of him a few days before the final, apparently Brazil had a 17-year-old left wing that scored four goals in three games. But I’ll be honest, we were more worried about other players like Vavá and Garrincha.<br /><br />We learned that we should have been worried. Pelé made two goals, including one amazing volley shot. I was impressed that he lacked the flaws in his game, even though he was so young. However, he was not the best in the finals, it was Didi and Garrincha, but you could see he had a rare talent. <br /><br />When we met a few times later in his career, he was the best in the world. I particularly remember a friendly in Stockholm against Brazil before the World Cup in England in 1966. Then he did something I had never seen before. Directly from the kick off he shot from the centre circle when our goalie stood far out. The goalkeeper barely made it back and tipped the ball over the bar, but the audience applauded and laughed at the bold attempt.<br /><br />He was incredibly humble. The win against us meant Brazil’s first World championship gold medal ever, and to show their appreciation to the Swedish audience in the stands, and to show respect towards us as opponents, they took a giant Swedish flag and ran lap of honour with the entire squad. Also, I know that when he did not play the first matches he sat in the stands in a small Swedish town among the common people. You don’t often see today’s stars do that.”</p><p>“Pelé was like no one else. He was a devil! The best of all time for me. He had a lot of personality, he headed well, had a good touch on the ball and, above all, he was a good teammate. He was a fantastic player but also very humble. You don’t always get that combination. He never complained about his teammates, he always encouraged them. I played a number of times against him. He was always a gentleman. Apart from being a great football player, he was also very educated. That’s why it’s worth remembering him.<br /><br />When we played Brazil in 1962 they were the reigning world champions and we lost the game 2-0. We knew we would have a tough game and so it proved. Mário Zagallo and Pelé scored the goals. We held out until the 56th minute but then Zagallo scored and it was an uphill battle just getting the ball after that. Pelé – who else – scored the second goal, which killed the game. I am honoured to have shared a pitch with Pelé.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/30/facing-pele-world-cup-brazil-played-against-him-sweden-mexico-italy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fourth consecutive monthly decline has driven annual house price growth down to 2.8% in December, Nationwide reports</p><p>Borrowing costs may have stabilised, but at higher levels than before September’s mini-budget, points out <strong>Tom Bill,</strong> head of UK residential research at estate agent <strong>Knight</strong> <strong>Frank</strong>.</p><p>This, <strong>Bill</strong> predicts, will weigh on prices next year.</p><p>“The steep monthly house price declines that followed the mini-Budget have reduced as mortgage market volatility calms down. However, borrowing costs have become more expensive as well as more stable, which will keep downwards pressure on prices.</p><p>Despite the fact mortgage rates should keep edging down, when the spring selling season gets underway in 2023, a fixed-rate mortgage is likely to be more than 2.5 percentage points higher than this spring, meaning many movers will have to reassess their options.</p><p>’The swap rate volatility sparked by the the mini-Budget has largely dissipated and mortgage rates have settled on the back of this. Lenders continue to chip away at the pricing of their fixed-rate mortgages but even so, there are still many people coming off fixes who are in for a payment shock. We expect lenders to come to market with more attractive pricing in January as they start from scratch in terms of building their business for the new year.</p><p>’Further interest rate rises are on the cards in the coming year as the Bank of England continues in its efforts to bring inflation under control. However, a lower peak in rates than previously thought may be sufficient, making life easier for borrowers.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/dec/30/uk-house-price-growth-december-stock-markets-ftse-100-2022-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From financial forecasts to the climate crisis, a constructive and nuanced critique of mathematical modelling from a data scientist</p><p>“The only function of economic forecasting,” wrote the great American economist John Kenneth Galbraith, “is to make astrology look respectable.” It is characteristic of Erica Thompson’s sprightly and highly original new book on the uses and abuses of mathematical modelling that she dares to turn Galbraith’s verdict on its head. The medieval practice of casting horoscopes, she shows in one typically engaging section that embodies her most important themes, has a surprising amount to teach us about the modern practice of using models to guide policy.</p><p>The topic is an exceptionally important and timely one. The Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and turbulence in financial markets are just three examples of how fundamental mathematical modelling has become to decision-making in many areas of modern life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five men apparently unknown to each other were probably forced to give false confessions</p><p>An actor, a radiologist, a poultry business employee, a karate champion, an engineer – these are five men sentenced to death in Iran for alleged crimes linked to anti-regime protests. The charges raised against them included murder. With court hearings held largely in secret, their trials have been widely condemned as a sham.</p><p>All are due to be executed in connection with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/iran-protests-five-sentenced-to-death-over-killing-of-paramilitary-member">killing</a> of an agent from the country’s feared paramilitary forces, the Basij. The court says Ruhollah Ajamian, 27, was stripped naked and murdered on 3 November. But the circumstances of Ajamian’s death are opaque. The alleged attack occurred at a protest commemorating a demonstrator, Hadis Najafi, who had been shot dead by security forces at a rally demanding rights for women.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/30/actor-doctor-engineer-stories-of-iranians-sentenced-to-death-over-killing-at-protest">Continue reading...</a>

The pairing of singer and actor over two-and-a-bit years was the stuff of internet legend: he was the sensitive hunk with a star-making turn in the TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s Normal People. She was the sorrowful indie-crooner who, it turned out, was one of Mescal’s favourite musicians. They met <a href="https://twitter.com/filmdaze/status/1589347897426202624">over Zoom</a>, in a public interview as the pandemic raged.

<p>The paint pioneer knows how to have fun with colour – her home is a lesson in bold walls and unlikely combinations</p><p>In Annie Sloan’s front room, there is a small, wooden table that she picked up at a flea market for next to nothing. The carved legs have been painted black but the top has the appearance of dark marble flecked with orange. “I’m really pleased with that table,” says Sloan. “I took a sponge, cut some more holes in it and used it to apply paint. It’s funny – sometimes I spend ages trying to make something work and it looks just awful. And then something takes me 10 minutes and it’s like, ‘Oh wow!’”</p><p>Sloan, 73, has been experimenting with paint and colour for over 50 years and shows no signs of slowing down. “When I left art school, I realised conceptual work didn’t actually make me happy,” she says. “It was colour that people seemed to need most in their lives.” Half a century on, in this age of greige and permacrises, we arguably need colour more than ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/homes-interiors-paint-colour-design-annie-sloan">Continue reading...</a>

## How Yulia Mahr met Max Richter: ‘My first impression was, who is this sweaty man?’

<p>Composer Richter and artist Mahr met when they collaborated on a project more than 30 years ago. They now have three children and live in Oxford</p><p>For the composer Max Richter it was love at first sight when he spotted the visual artist Yulia Mahr at Edinburgh festival in 1988. She was performing in a play of the Mahabharata, and he was impressed by her talent and beauty. “There were only a few people there. I saw this woman acting and fell in love instantly,” he remembers. “Of course, I never thought I’d see her again, and she never saw me.”</p><p>Two years later, their paths crossed again. Yulia was working as a director for a theatre company in London called the Arts Threshold. “It was set up by Brian Astbury, to give young people their first chance in theatre. There was a lot of experimental stuff going on,” she says. “I needed a composer for a show called The Painted Lady, and someone suggested I speak to Max.” Having studied music, Max was in the early stages of his career, performing regularly as a pianist and trying to make a name for himself as a composer. The interview took place in Maison Bertaux, a Soho patisserie that was a popular hangout for artists at the time. “He cycled there, so my first impression was: ‘Who is this sweaty man?’” laughs Yulia. As they began chatting, she was impressed by his “inquiring mind … He was really up for experimentation. He was clearly happy to question himself and the world,” she says. “I hired him to do the composing role, as I thought he’d turn up and be committed, which is what I really needed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/how-yulia-mahr-met-max-richter-my-first-impression-was-who-is-this-sweaty-man">Continue reading...</a>
