China enters second wave

Poor data, cases, infections, hospitalisations, deaths, genomes

https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/cn

Population 1,412,600,000 

Will be infected in next 6 weeks

Daily new infection rate over an 8 week period 

Per week =  176,575,000

Per day  = 25,225,011

World meter

Actual deaths
https://covid19.healthdata.org/china?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend

Over the next 3 months

Therefore about 100,000 deaths per month

About 3,300 per day

Population 1,412,600,000 

Infection fatality rate = 0.000207

Flight into Milan’s Malpensa airport

Mandatory Covid tests for flights from China

December 26

First flight, 38% tested positive

Second flight, 52% tested positive

Positives to be used for genomic testing

It would be better if the coordination of surveillance should take place at a European level

Screening passengers from China

Italy, US, India, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan

UK not testing arrivals from China

26 direct flights due in January

Half a million visitors per year

Immune-evasive / more transmissible variant

Lots of people infected today

Some with immune compromise

Ongoing contact with potential animal reservoirs

Potential for reverse zoonosis

Professor Aris Katzourakis, Evolution and Genomics, University of Oxford

I am not going to predict a direction, but there will be a whole lot of opportunity for rapid change

Xu Wenbo, China, Center for Disease Control and Prevention

More than 130 omicron sublineages,

detected in China over the last three months

The fact that 1.4 billion people are suddenly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 obviously creates conditions prone to emerging variants

Antoine Flahault, Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva

Any variants, when more transmissible than the previous dominant ones, definitely represent threats, since they can cause new waves

When is a covid death a covid death?

Prof Wang Guiqiang, National Health Commission

Revised its guidelines, 

to scientifically and objectively reflect deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic

Only fatalities caused by pneumonia and respiratory failure

Not deaths caused by cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases, blood clots, sepsis

the main cause of death from infection with Omicron is the underlying diseases

Why We Question the Safety Profile of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines

(Robert M Kaplan and Sander Greenland)

https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/why-we-question-the-safety-of-covid

Using publicly available data from Pfizer and Moderna studies, 

we found one serious adverse event for each 800 vaccinees.   

That translates to about 1,250 serious events for each million vaccine recipients. 

US, Spain, Australia

Study to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials.

Secondary analysis of serious adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled, phase III randomized clinical trials,

of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

Results

Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest

Pfizer

10.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baselines of 17.6

Moderna

15.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baseline of 42.2

Combined, the mRNA vaccines

Associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated

Pfizer trial

Pfizer vaccine group

52 serious AESI (27.7 per 10,000) were reported

Pfizer placebo group

33 serious AESI (17.6 per 10,000) were reported

36 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group

Risk difference 18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated

Moderna trial

Moderna trial, vaccine group

87 serious AESI (57.3 per 10,000) were reported

Moderna trial, placebo group

64 serious AESI (42.2 per 10,000) were reported

6 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group

Risk difference 7.1 per 10,000 vaccinated

Discussion

The excess risk of serious adverse events found in our study points to the need for formal harm-benefit analyses, 

particularly those that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. 

These analyses will require public release of participant level datasets.

Full transparency of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data is needed,

to properly evaluate these questions. 

Unfortunately, as we approach 2 years after release of COVID-19 vaccines,

participant level data remain inaccessible. 

Level of adverse reactions in the past

The 1976 swine flu vaccine

Small increased risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome

The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. 

When over 40 million people were vaccinated against swine flu, 

federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, 

necessitated stopping immunization until the issue could be explored.

The Institute of Medicine (2003)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221528/

Concluded that people who received the 1976 swine influenza vaccine had an increased risk for developing GBS. 

Exact reason for this association remains unknown.

Rotavirus vaccine Rotashield, (1999)

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus/vac-rotashield-historical.htm

The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)

October 22, 1999 to no longer recommend use of the RotaShield® vaccine for infants,

because of an association between the vaccine and intussusception.

The results of the investigations showed that RotaShield® vaccine caused intussusception in some healthy infants

Within 2 weeks

Intussusception increased 20 to 30 times over the expected risk

(Less after the second and third dose)

CDC estimated that one or two additional cases of intussusception would be caused among each 10,000 infants vaccinated with RotaShield® vaccine.
