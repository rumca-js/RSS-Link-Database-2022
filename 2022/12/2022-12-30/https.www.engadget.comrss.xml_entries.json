The app unveiled a new ratings system earlier this year, called Content Levels, to help it identify more \u201cmature\u201d content.</p><p>Now, the company has <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/strengthening-enforcement-of-sexually-suggestive-content\"><ins>another update</ins></a> on those efforts.

But content with more \u201cmature\u201d themes, but that doesn\u2019t contain explicit nudity, has long been more difficult for automated systems to consistently detect.

The open-source service was created in 2016, and first gained notoriety in 2017, when some Twitter users were upset with changes the company had made to the functionality of @-replies. At that time though, it didn\u2019t gain much traction outside a small base of hardcore enthusiasts.</p><figure><img alt=\"LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 08, 2021:Connor Matlen, 6, and his father Logan 45, of Hawthorne, spread their arms out to try and cover the length of American mastodon on exhibit at The La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles that re-opened to the public after being closed for over a year due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Mastodon saw an immediate <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternative-mastodon-open-source-021001965.html\">spike</a> back in April and the momentum has only increased, according to the nonprofit. \u201cMastodon has recently exploded in popularity, jumping from approx. 300K monthly active users to 2.5M between the months of October and November, with more and more journalists, political figures, writers, actors and organizations moving over,\u201d founder Eugen Rochko wrote in a recent <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/12/twitter-suspends-mastodon-account-prevents-sharing-links/\">blog post</a>.</p><p>The service isn\u2019t a perfect analog to Twitter. Its platform, which runs on thousands of servers, can make signing up a bit confusing. And a couple of the platform\u2019s most popular servers, like mastodon.social, have at times halted new sign-ups due to surging demand.</p><p>But, as Rochko points out, the decentralized platform has become one of the top platforms of choice for some of Twitter\u2019s most influential \u2014 and most followed \u2014 users. Tellingly, when Musk briefly imposed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-free-promotion-of-competing-platforms-182712974.html\">a ban</a> on accounts promoting alternative social networks, Mastodon\u2019s official Twitter account was the only social app to be suspended.</p><p>Mastodon is far from the only previously-niche app to get a boost from turmoil at Twitter. Other apps like CounterSocial, which has a Tweetdeck-like interface, and Tribel, which describes itself as a \u201cpro-democracy Twitter alternative\u201d have also seen an uptick in sign-ups.</p><p>There\u2019s also a wave of competition from fresh upstarts. Post News, a new service from former Waze CEO Noam Bardin has also tried to capitalize on Twitter\u2019s dysfunction. The service, which is currently invitation-only, rushed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/28/post-news-twitter-alternative-a16z/\">to launch</a> an early version of its beta in November in hopes of drawing away disillusioned Twitter users.

The site has also made a habit of trolling Musk and his new policies for Twitter, including with the addition of <a href=\"https://staff.tumblr.com/post/700564142648606720/hi-were-introducing-completely-useless-blue\">a $7.99</a> \u201cImportant Blue Internet Checkmark\u201d for users\u2019 blogs.

The company recently launched a new <a href=\"http://engadget.com/instagram-bereal-candid-notes-172854546.html\">\u201cNotes\u201d feature</a> within Instagram that allows users to share status updates at the top of their inbox.

But in the past, surges to outside platforms have been relatively short lived. And most would-be competitors are still only a fraction of the size of Twitter.</p><p>Even with an influx of new users, Mastodon, Post News, Hive Social and Tumblr are still substantially smaller than Twitter. And, as unpopular and autocratic and Musk\u2019s policy decisions seem, the idea of starting over on a new platform can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html\">feel daunting.</a> Not everyone can easily rebuild their social graphs on alternative sites, and some may find the growing crop of Twitter clones to also be unwelcoming (this is especially true if you rely on accessibility features, as many of the newer platforms haven\u2019t invested much in these features.)</p><p>Still, this particular moment feels different than other times when Twitter has struggled to keep disgruntled users around.

You may be wondering where to start with setting up a new Apple Watch if you just received one, and it's true, there's a lot to do to make sure you\u2019re getting the most out of your new wearable. Let us guide you through that process, from initial setup to optimizing everything it can do.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>Of course, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is pair your Apple Watch with your iPhone. Even if you have a cellular-capable Apple Watch, an iPhone is required for setting up and managing the device. Fortunately, this process is extremely straightforward \u2014 after powering on the Apple Watch, just place it near an unlocked iPhone and you\u2019ll get a prompt to set the device up. During this process, your iPhone will walk you through the initial pairing as well as signing in with your Apple ID, assigning a passcode, setting up things like Siri and Apple Pay, and deciding if you want to transfer your compatible apps. I recommend against transferring all your apps automatically, as the Watch is a lot more useful when you curate it with only what you need.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch notifications\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/65a446d0-5f50-11ec-93df-91c4c5e63f67\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A few features you definitely should set up are fall detection, crash detection and emergency SOS. The latter lets you quickly place a call to local emergency services by pressing and holding the side button, while fall detection uses the Watch\u2019s accelerometers and other sensors to, well, detect if you\u2019ve taken a fall. It\u2019ll initiate an emergency SOS call automatically if you\u2019ve taken a spill and it doesn\u2019t sense you moving. Before making that call, the Watch will try its best to get your attention via a notification, a vibration and an audible alarm. Crash detection, which is only available on the new Series 8 and Ultra, works in a similar fashion, except in this case it\u2019s looking for movement that it recognizes as a car accident, with the accelerometer able to detect up to 256 Gs of impact force.</p><h2>The fun part: tweaking apps and notifications</h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch Series 7\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you have the basics set up, it\u2019s time to make the Apple Watch your own. By default, the Apple Watch mirrors all notifications that go to your phone. But I\u2019ve found the Watch to be much more useful with a bit of curation. In the iPhone Watch app, you can customize notifications for all of Apple\u2019s first-party apps, or turn them off entirely. For example, the Activity app notifications panel lets you choose whether or not you want reminders to stand every hour, or notifications when your friends share activity milestones with you and so forth.</p><p>Third-party apps don\u2019t have the same granularity, but you can always turn them off altogether so they won\u2019t ping your Watch. For things that aren\u2019t particularly time-sensitive (say, updates from Google Photos, or Apple News updates), it\u2019s best to just skip them. They\u2019ll still hit your iPhone, and you can always enable them again later.</p><p>The iPhone Watch app also lets you pick which specific apps from your iPhone will be installed on the Apple Watch. I think this is more useful than just letting the Watch install every single compatible app. I prefer going through the list and deciding if there\u2019s a benefit to having these apps on my wrist. In the case of apps like Google Maps or Ecobee for controlling my thermostat, it\u2019s a definite yes. But things like Etsy or Bank of America don\u2019t exactly make a ton of sense on a Watch. And if you change your mind, you can remove an app from the Watch app or by long-pressing it in grid view and deleting it \u2013 just keep in mind that this will remove the app from your Watch but not from your iPhone.</p><p>That said, I have been surprised at what some developers have envisioned for the Apple Watch. Take the notes app Bear, for example. I often use it to make grocery lists, and checklists show up great on the Apple Watch. So if there\u2019s an app on your phone that you consider essential, give it a shot on the Watch.</p><h2>Watch faces</h2><p>Another occasionally-overlooked part of the Apple Watch experience are watch faces. Since this is literally what you\u2019ll see every time you raise your wrist, I think it\u2019s worth finding ones that fit your personal style. While there are no third-party faces, the Apple Watch has more than 30 built-in options that are endlessly customizable. We\u2019re talking about a huge variety of colors, different typefaces and watch styles, complications (small slices of info like weather, date, or music controls) and much more. You can have a simple digital time display with nothing else, or an info-dense face with eight different complications or anything in between.</p><p>You can set up new faces on the Watch directly \u2014 but as with most in-depth features, it\u2019s easier to do this on the iPhone. The Face Gallery shows every available face, along with multiple examples of how they can be customized. You can use those as a jumping off point to make your own creations. Once you\u2019ve curated your favorites, you can simply swipe through them on the Watch itself when you want to mix things up. If you long press on a face, you can edit it directly on your Watch too, which is handy when you want to just change the color quickly to better match your outfit.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch faces\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/120c76d0-5f4d-11ec-ab3e-59df7abc5955\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you\u2019re using an Apple Watch Series 5 or later, you can also decide whether you want to activate the always-on display. You can find this option in the settings app, under \u201cDisplay &amp; Brightness.\u201d If you\u2019re after maximum battery life, turn this off, but most people will probably prefer it on. New watches can still get a full day of use while using the always-on feature, but once your watch ages a bit and battery performance degrades, you might want to learn to live without it. Note that both versions of the Apple Watch SE do not have an always-on display.</p><h2>Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s \u201caction button\u201d</h2><figure><img alt=\"Side view of the Apple Watch Ultra on a person's wrist, showing the apps gallery on its screen. Facing the camera are the watch's Digital Crown with an orange ring on it, as well as the dock button.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/58303c90-441d-11ed-bff2-1ef1157ed60d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJESks0RzlDL3JlZj1mc19hX3d0Ml91czA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjMTI4MjVmLTFjN2MtNDJhMi1hZjU1LTAyYWIxZDAyMzUxYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWJBUVH8NIdeX0z5Z9Jxg91jcbdJYyc0BtThhIhnL4B6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJK4G9C%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us0\">new Apple Watch Ultra</a> is the first with a second button on its side. Unlike the standard button on the right, which lets you pull up recently used apps, access Apple Pay and a handful of other features, the Ultra\u2019s Action Button is a blank slate. You can set it up for a variety of actions, like tracking intervals on a run, setting a compass waypoint for you to navigate back to later, starting a dive or other things that third-party apps could enable. You might be better off using your Watch for a bit before deciding on what it is best suited for, but don\u2019t forget about it.</p><h2>Fitness tracking</h2><p>One of the biggest Apple Watch selling points is its fitness-tracking features. Whether or not you actually exercise on a regular basis, the Watch will monitor your steps and activity level, and use that data to track your daily movement via three rings that you\u2019re encouraged to close. The \u201cmove\u201d ring is how many active calories you burn in a day, the \u201cexercise\u201d ring tracks activity at or above a brisk walk, and the \u201cstand\u201d ring notes whether or not you get up and move for a minute or two each hour of the day.</p><p>When you set up your Apple Watch, it\u2019ll suggest daily goals for each of these, and the Activity app (or the Fitness app on your iPhone) will show how close you are to hitting them. If you\u2019ve never used an Apple Watch before, it\u2019s fine to just go with the defaults \u2014 every week, you\u2019ll get a recap of how you did and it\u2019ll even suggest bumping up your Move number if you\u2019re easily surpassing it. The exercise and stand options default to 30 minutes per day and 12 hours per day, respectively, but those too can be adjusted.</p><p>For extra motivation, the Fitness app lets you connect with other friends who use an Apple Watch and see how much progress they\u2019re making against their three rings. Naturally, you can use this information to taunt them about their couch-potato habits, but you can also challenge them to informal competitions. You earn points based on the percentage you close each of your rings every day, and the person with the most points after a week wins. It\u2019s pretty casual, but it\u2019s also a fun way to stay motivated.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch fitness\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68b1b540-5f4d-11ec-a59a-4faf9cf1e6c3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to track a specific workout, like a run, walk, or weight-training session you do that in the \u201cworkout\u201d app. There, you\u2019ll find the many different types of workouts that the Watch can track. If you already have a favorite way to track exercise on your phone, though, chances are you can find it for the Apple Watch too. Nike Run Club, MapMyRun, Peloton and others all have Watch apps that let you track workouts using the wearable\u2019s sensors. Also, a lot of apps can now connect with the Health app on your iPhone. It\u2019s a database of all your activity and workout data from your Watch, so you might be able to easily sync workout data from there into your service of choice. As with most things Apple Watch, it\u2019ll just take a bit of playing around to see what works best for you.</p><h2>Other health features</h2><p>Newer Apple Watches offer a few other health-tracking features, as well. For example, you can rest your thumb on the Apple Watch crown to take an ECG measurement, or have the watch detect your blood oxygen level. Those features don\u2019t really require anything to get started, but ones like sleep tracking, medication reminders and advanced cycle tracking via the temperature sensor on the Apple Watch Series 8 and Ultra require some adjustments to work properly.</p><p>You\u2019ll find sleep settings on your iPhone in the Health app. There, you can set a goal for how many hours of sleep you want to get a night and tell your Watch and iPhone what time you want to get up every day. You can also set up different schedules (for the week or weekend) and fine-tune details like what alarm sounds you want and when the sleep focus setting (which reduces distractions like notifications and the always-on display) turns on. Once that\u2019s done, you can view sleep history data on your Watch or phone that shows how much time you spend in REM, core or deep sleep as well as when and how often you wake up.</p><p>The medication tracking feature is pretty lightweight, but potentially handy if you want help sticking to your schedule. As with most of these other features, you set up a schedule in the Health app on your iPhone. From there you\u2019ll add the medication name, add a schedule and a visual identifier and also take note of any interactions you want to have on record. Once that\u2019s done, you can log all your medications for the day or an individual one through the Apple Watch app.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple Medications app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-06/4f50aa40-e5c4-11ec-adef-3a0f0848dd0b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><p>If you menstruate, the Apple Watch Series 8 and Ultra can use a temperature sensor along with your reported data on when you have your period to estimate when you may be ovulating. To use this, you\u2019ll need to set up manual cycle tracking in the Health app on your phone first, which lets you log the days you have your period each month (you can do this via an app on the Apple Watch itself, too). Assuming you input this data and wear your Watch when sleeping, you\u2019ll then be able to get a notification on when you may be ovulating.</p><p>Given the extremely sensitive nature of this data, Apple has a <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2xlZ2FsL3ByaXZhY3kvZGF0YS9lbi9oZWFsdGgtYXBwLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGMxMjgyNWYtMWM3Yy00MmEyLWFmNTUtMDJhYjFkMDIzNTFiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfnStfRgaKXG8xREYtsl8bgeOYIjhRSGR6_oXmAYPLKv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy%2Fdata%2Fen%2Fhealth-app%2F\">detailed write-up</a> on how it keeps this private. Long story short, Apple Health information is encrypted and unreadable by default if your phone is locked behind a passcode, Touch ID or Face ID. And if you use iOS 12 or later and have two-factor authentication turned on for your Apple ID, it can be backed up to iCloud while still remaining unreadable by Apple.</p><p>However, you may have granted third-party apps access to your health data at some point. If you want to check and rescind those permissions, go to the Health app on your iPhone and tap the \u201csharing\u201d tab at the bottom. There you\u2019ll see what apps have access to your Health data and what specific pieces of info they can see. For example, Runkeeper can view things like my walking and running distance as well as workouts that I log, but it doesn\u2019t have access to sleep or medication tracking. In this menu, you can delete all data that third-party apps have access to and revoke an app\u2019s permissions to see your health info.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>One of my favorite things about the Apple Watch is that it can stream music and podcasts \u2013 not just from Apple\u2019s services but others like Spotify and Pandora as well. You\u2019ll need a cellular-capable Watch to stream music without your phone, but the good news is that Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora all allow you to save music directly on the Watch as well. Regardless of whether you spring for the cellular model or not, there\u2019s a way to listen to tunes and leave your phone behind.</p><p>If you\u2019re an Apple Music user, you\u2019ll manage downloads through the Watch app on your iPhone. Pop that open and go to the \u201cMusic\u201d section and you\u2019ll see a big button to add songs. There\u2019s also a setting that\u2019ll automatically download albums and playlists you\u2019ve listened to recently \u2013 turn that on and you\u2019ll always have some music on your wrist.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch music\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/14dc89f0-5f51-11ec-beff-76085033b240\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It\u2019s easy to choose specific albums or playlists you want saved, too. Just hit the big plus button and you\u2019ll see your Apple Music library. From there, just navigate to what you want, hit another plus button and it\u2019ll be downloaded to your Watch. Note that music only transfers when your Watch is charging, so you\u2019ll need to take it off your wrist to sync.</p><p>If you\u2019re using Spotify, just navigate to an album, playlist or podcast on your phone and tap the three dots icon \u2013 you\u2019ll see an option to \u201cdownload to Apple Watch\u201d there. Then, on your watch, there\u2019s a clearly-marked \u201cdownloads\u201d section where you can play content without a connection.</p><h2>Experiment, experiment, experiment!</h2><figure><img alt=\"The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like many Apple products, the Apple Watch has a lot of functionality and hidden complexity beneath its user-friendly surface. But I\u2019ve found that the Watch hides a lot of features, so it\u2019s worth checking out the built-in Tips app for suggestions on what you can do. Without a guide like that, you\u2019ll probably never realize that clicking the side button twice summons Apple Pay, or that you can display the grid of icons in a list if you prefer. Chances are good you\u2019re not going to irrevocably mess something up, so tap and swipe and scroll and dig into the settings.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-set-up-your-new-apple-watch-150031548.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-30 14:23:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: CES 2023 Preview", "description": "<p>Can you believe CES is just a week away?

Over the past ten years as battery capacities have grown and range anxieties have shrunk, electric vehicles have become a daily sight in most parts of the country.

The company offers solid performance and decent sound quality for well under $50 in some models. For 2023, JLab is taking things a step further in multiple ways with its smallest true wireless earbuds yet and also its first premium noise-canceling set. What's more, the company is jumping into the over-the-counter hearing aid market with two options with &quot;discreet&quot; designs.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the $39 JBuds Mini are 30-percent smaller than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html\">JLab's Go Air Pop</a> that debuted in 2021. They aren't the company's cheapest model, but despite the tiny stature, the JBuds Mini still pack on-board controls, Bluetooth multipoint connectivity and over six hours of listening on a charge (over 20 hours with the case). The charging case is also quite small \u2014 about the size of a car key fob \u2014 and has an integrated key ring loop.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>On the higher end, the $199 Epic Air Lab Edition earbuds are JLab's first hybrid dual driver design and, as you might expect, the company is calling them its best-sounding option to date. Equipped with active noise cancellation (ANC) and ambient sound mode, the Epic Air Lab Edition also offers touch controls, Bluetooth multipoint and over 54 hours of use when you factor in the wireless charging case. The company says there will be multiple ANC modes available in its app and a USB-C dongle will offer low-latency Bluetooth LE audio for video and games.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"JLab hearing aid\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/35b76810-87a1-11ed-b33f-341eaec0afc9\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>JLab OTC Hearing Aid prototype.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">JLab</div></figure><p>Now that over-the-counter hearing aids have been approved by the FDA, you can expect to see a lot of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-unveils-1000-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-131152865.html\">headphone companies</a> entering that market. JLab has two models that will debut in 2023: the OTC Hearing Aid and the Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid. The former is $99 while the pricing on the latter is TBD. The company says both will be compatible with iOS and Android with &quot;impressive&quot; battery life. Details are scarce for now, but we expect a lot more info before these two hearing aids arrive later in the year. And based on the early renders, at least one of them will look like a set of JLab true wireless earbuds.</p><p>JLab says all of these new products, which will be the focus of its CES showcase, will be available during Q3 2023.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/jlab-jbuds-mini-epic-air-lab-edition-hearing-aids-050155480.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-30 05:01:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
