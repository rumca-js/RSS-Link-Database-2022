If there is any silver lining, albeit one that doesn't make up for the loss of life, it's that I'm sure the Bills will be putting the city on their back next Monday and using the motivation to straight-up murder the Cincinnati Bengals. But that's beside the point.</p><p>When natural disasters shut a city down, it's not uncommon for people to start looting. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-looting" target="_self">There are some states</a> where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hurricane-ian-looters-sheriff-grady" target="_self">looting is frowned upon</a>. But thanks to Democrat control of New York, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/buffalo-looting-caught" target="_blank">stealing has become a spectator sport</a>.  Though one man stood up and attempted to make a difference. He confronted looters and told them to put it all back.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This man telling <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Buffalo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Buffalo</a> looters to "put the shit back" is the hero we didn't know we needed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuffaloBlizzard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BuffaloBlizzard</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuffaloLooting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BuffaloLooting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuffaloBlizzard2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BuffaloBlizzard2022</a> <a href="https://t.co/rXidwNuGER">pic.twitter.com/rXidwNuGER</a><br />— Cameron Gray (@Cameron_Gray) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cameron_Gray/status/1607746417962926080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Call it being jaded by 2022, but I'm torn with videos like this. You appreciate someone having the courage to stand up and do the right thing. Help clean up his neighborhood and look out for his neighbors.</p><p>But then you notice it's a corporate chain, so it's not like it's a mom-and-pop local business. The crime is out of control because the same "leaders" keep getting elected <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-clinton-crime" target="_blank">and claim the rise in crime is a myth</a>. The media is on the side of the politicians. Other residents keep electing those same failed leaders election cycle after election cycle.</p><p>And what if something happened between the man and the looter? This is New York. The elected officials, the media, and the corporate chain would all side with the criminal instead of the man attempting to do the right thing. Now he's putting his livelihood and that of his family at risk. For what?</p><p>God bless this man for having the courage to stand up and do something. I'd like to think we'd all stand up and do the same. But I also understand why someone wouldn't.</p><p><p>

## Hooters enlists Elon Musk to fight fake news and inform Twitter users millennials do in fact still love boobs

Musk has been proving his commitment to the latter throughout 2022. And he's been enlisted by fine dining establishment <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-hooters-florida-school" target="_blank">Hooters</a> to help spread the gospel on the former.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Panic struck aficionados of chesticles this week when a satirical tweet flew a bit too close to reality. It was reported that Hooters was rebranding because millennials aren't that into boobs.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hooters is shutting down and “rebranding” after new study shows that millennials “aren’t that into boobs” <a href="https://t.co/JoMyRLx4Q7">pic.twitter.com/JoMyRLx4Q7</a><br />— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyLoud/status/1608159685227732993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Everyone loves boobs. Just ask <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-suspension" target="_blank">Kayla Lemieux</a>. Millennials causing a branding change because they don't like funbags sounded truthy enough. You can imagine a mask-wearing millennial couple leading the charge against the delightfully tacky (yet unfined) eatery as they drag their kids to a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-family-friendly" target="_blank">family-friendly sex show</a>. </p><p>Rest assured, the rumors are not true. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a763a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32426969&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Because people were sharing a screen capture of the tweet, no one was seeing the community notes pointing out it "incorrectly reports details from a 2017 article" that had nothing to do with boobs. The problem is, even the Chief Twit himself was fooled.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Can’t tell if satire or real<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608385658867036160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Hootie, the social media brand ambassador for the chain, reached out to Elon and said in no uncertain terms boobs are as popular as they've ever been.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Elon if you could let the world know that millennials do in fact love boobs that would be really cool.<br />— Hootie (@Hooters) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hooters/status/1608459990724902912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon breathed a sigh of relief and a new alliance was formed.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <a href="https://t.co/XHfUMhyfHc">pic.twitter.com/XHfUMhyfHc</a><br />— Hootie (@Hooters) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hooters/status/1608479183319060480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Crisis averted. As Elon and anyone who celebrated their 21st birthday at the Hooters down the block from their college in the 90s will agree, GenXers are the last generation that doesn't suck. Our appreciation of knockers is unwavering. When it comes to millennials and -- God help us all -- zoomers, they seem hellbent on destroying everything Americans love.</p><p>Not this time, though. Not today. Thanks to Elon and Hootie working together, breasts will be protected.</p><p><p>

## 'I'm losing my g*ddamn mind': Woman records herself having full-blown meltdown over an ambulance in the bike lane

People who ride bikes -- whether they be urban, suburban, or rural -- are cool. Urban cyclists, the ones who demand their own lanes and act like the streets belong to them -- need to get over themselves. And in the case of one bay area dingbat, need to calm their tits. There are worse things in life than having an ambulance parked in front of you.</p><p>Though if nothing else, it's nice to write about San Francisco for a reason <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-san-francisco-mayor" target="_blank">other than drugs</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-streets" target="_blank">poop on the streets</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">San Francisco bicyclist throws an unhinged tantrum when bike lane is blocked by SFFD <a href="https://t.co/TjVyDyv8RP">pic.twitter.com/TjVyDyv8RP</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1608607042654330880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>You are killing us.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>You'll notice how Debbie Dignbat would be totes okay with the ambulance blocking the car lane or the motorcycle lane. But because HER lane was blocked, she freaked out. Though in her defense, she also saw a van, two cars, and an Amazon Prime truck in the bike lane. So the ambulance was one vehicle too many for her brain to handle.</p><p>But here is the lowkey best thing about this video. She recorded it herself. Had this been a meltdown that a third party recorded -- they witnessed the incident, took out their phone, and did it for the content -- that would be one thing. Debbie made the decision -- the conscious decision -- to record this herself while she transcended into madness. Not only did she record it, but she was so proud of it she shared it somewhere. Hence Clown World finding it.</p><p>In Debbie Dingbat's brain, she legit does not think she's the assh*le here. And that's hilarious.</p><p><p>

## Dem congresswoman's horrible treatment of wounded warrior for getting her sick looks worse after a resurfaced video

Katie Porter came in under the wire as a nominee for Worst Person of 2022.  Porter is already insufferable. She wants <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/katie-porter-msnbc-abortion" target="_blank">more abortions to fight inflation</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/greta-thunberg-katie-porter" target="_blank">needs Greta Thunberg to raise her kids</a> for her. But with two days to go before the end of the year, we ALSO find out she fired a staffer for catching SCHMOVID.</p><p>The staffer is Sasha Georgiades, who had a Wounded Warriors fellowship in Porter's office. In fairness to the congresswoman, her <a href="https://www.outkick.com/democratic-politician-katie-porter-reportedly-fired-a-staffer-for-allegedly-giving-her-covid/" target="_blank">office denies firing Georgiades</a> and says her fellowship ended. But the fellowship was supposed to end in August 2022. The staffer was "told never to come back" on July 9th after catching SCHMOVID. Porter also caught SCMOVID and blamed the staffer for it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">VIBE CHECK: Rep.

And that, quote, "now my kids have no one to take care of them."

Two weeks after treating Sasha Georgiades -- a wounded warrior -- like garbage, blaming her for getting the Congresswoman sick, blaming her for the congresswoman being "unable" to "take care of her kids," and BANNING Georgiades -- again, a wounded warrior -- from her office, Katie Porter released a prerecorded video using Georgiades to claim how much Katie Porter respects our veterans.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">We need to be backing up our gratitude for veterans with action.

## This 2022 Elon Musk tweet about cocaine is the second most-liked tweet of all-time

And out of every tweet ever, it is the second most liked tweet of all time. A better way to say farewell to 2022 could not be conceived.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4368f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32422890&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Discovering this starts with the drama between <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-tech-banned-andrew-tate" target="_blank">Andrew Tate</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/greta-thunberg-cop26" target="_blank">Greta Thunberg</a>. If you care to get into the weeds of it or care who either person is, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11583711/Andrew-Tates-luxury-villa-Romania-raided-police.html" target="_blank">pursue this at your leisure</a>. The bullet points are that Tate tried to flex on Greta about how many cars he owned. Greta made him look silly in her tweet response. Tate overreacted. He was eating pizza from a Romanian pizza chain. Romanian police arrested Tate on charges of sex trafficking. Twitter thinks the pizza box tipped him off based on a single tweet by a woke activist claiming so. Also, because the whole ordeal is so silly, I don't think people are thinking too deeply about it.</p><p>Greta stans and Tate haters have been sharing this chart from WikiPedia showing them the most liked tweets of all time, highlighting the only joke Greta Thunberg has ever told in her life.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e75a7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32422869&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>What I was more fascinated by is that out of all Elon Musk's tweets, all his memes, all his dunks, and all his viral communications to the Twitterverse, sandwiched between Chadwick Boseman and Barack Obama as the #2 most liked tweet of all time, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-coca-cola" target="_blank">was this one</a>:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Next I’m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519480761749016577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Next I’m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="dec18" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32422878&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>That's right, friends. <a href="https://archives.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/did-coca-cola-ever-contain-cocaine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Back in the day, Coke was made with coke</a>. It wasn't just a clever name. There was a more classic version than Coca-Cola Classic! And over 4.7 million Twitter users like the idea of going back to the good old days. Or, they may not like the idea as much as they like the smell. </p><p>200,000,000,000 tweets per year, and the second most liked of all time is Elon's joke about riding white lines. At least I think it's a joke. We all thought his buying Twitter at one point was a joke too.</p><p>And apropos of nothing, what's with k-cup band BTS having THREE tweets in the Top 12 that's just them tweeting emojis? No one should have that much power.</p><p><p>
