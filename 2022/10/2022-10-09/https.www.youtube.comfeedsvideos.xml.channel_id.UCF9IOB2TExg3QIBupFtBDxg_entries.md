Thank you Rachel and Tom Barker for sharing your daughters recent illness and treatment, together with the need for chicken pox vaccinations. We all wish Clara and yourselvs the best possible outcomes.

Now all of the facts were equal, but some facts were more equal than others.

Open letter from BMJ to Facebook about inappropriate censoring of serious data integrity issues in Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine trial

As current and incoming editors in chief, we are responsible for everything The BMJ contains.

Dear Mark Zuckerberg,

The BMJ, one of the world’s oldest and most influential general medical journals. 

https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/history-of-the-bmj

3rd October 1840

Serious concerns about the “fact checking” 

being undertaken by third party providers on behalf of Facebook/Meta.

In September, a former employee of Ventavia, a contract research company helping carry out the main Pfizer covid-19 vaccine trial, began providing The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

These materials revealed a host of poor clinical trial research practices occurring at Ventavia that could impact data integrity and patient safety. 

We also discovered that, despite receiving a direct complaint about these problems over a year ago, the FDA did not inspect Ventavia’s trial sites.

The BMJ commissioned an investigative reporter to write up the story for our journal. 

The article was published on 2 November, (2021) following legal review, external peer review and subject to The BMJ’s usual high level editorial oversight and review.

Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial

https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635

But from November 10, readers began reporting a variety of problems when trying to share our article. 

Some reported being unable to share it. 

Many others reported having their posts flagged with a warning about “Missing context … Independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people.” 

Those trying to post the article were informed by Facebook that people who repeatedly share “false information” might have their posts moved lower in Facebook’s News Feed. 

Group administrators where the article was shared received messages from Facebook informing them that such posts were “partly false.”

Readers were directed to a “fact check” performed by a Facebook contractor named Lead Stories.

Fact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying And Ignored Reports Of Flaws In Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials

https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-british-medical-journal-did-not-reveal-disqualifying-and-ignored-reports-of-flaws-in-pfizer-vaccine-trial.html

We find the “fact check” performed by Lead Stories to be inaccurate, incompetent and irresponsible.

– It fails to provide any assertions of fact that The BMJ article got wrong

– It has a nonsensical title: “Fact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying And Ignored Reports Of Flaws In Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials”

– The first paragraph inaccurately labels The BMJ a “news blog”

– It contains a screenshot of our article with a stamp over it stating “Flaws Reviewed,” despite the Lead Stories article not identifying anything false or untrue in The BMJ article

– It published the story on its website under a URL that contains the phrase “hoax-alert”

We have contacted Lead Stories, but they refuse to change anything about their article or actions that have led to Facebook flagging our article.

We have also contacted Facebook directly, requesting immediate removal of the “fact checking” label and any link to the Lead Stories article, thereby allowing our readers to freely share the article on your platform.

There is also a wider concern that we wish to raise. 

We are aware that The BMJ is not the only high quality information provider to have been affected by the incompetence of Meta’s fact checking regime.

To give one other example, we would highlight the treatment by Instagram (also owned by Meta) of Cochrane, the international provider of high quality systematic reviews of the medical evidence.

Florida, Guidance for mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines 

October 7, 2022 

https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221007-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccines-doc.pdf

Florida continues to emphasize that health care providers review all data to evaluate risks and benefits unique to each patient when determining any health care services to provide, 

including the administration of COVID-19 vaccines containing Messenger RNA (mRNA) which both the Pfizer- BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines utilize. 

The Florida Department of Health (Department) conducted an analysis through a self-controlled case series, 

https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4515

a technique originally developed to evaluate vaccine safety. 

This studied mortality risk following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. 

This analysis found there is an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination. 

Individuals with preexisting cardiac conditions, such as myocarditis and pericarditis, 

should take particular caution when considering vaccination and discuss with their health care provider. 

Florida Department of Health has issued the following guidance: 

Based on currently available data, 

patients should be informed of the possible cardiac complications that can arise after receiving a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 

With a high level of global immunity to COVID-19, 

the benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac- related death among men in this age group. 

The State Surgeon General now recommends against the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for males ages 18-39 years old. 

Males over the age of 60 had a 10% increased risk of cardiac-related death within 28 days of mRNA vaccination. 

Non-mRNA vaccines were not found to have these increased risks among any population. 

Floridians are encouraged to discuss all the potential benefits and risks of receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines with their health care provider. 

The risk associated with mRNA vaccination should be weighed against the risk associated with COVID-19 infection. 

The Department continues to stand by its Guidance for Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccines 

http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/press-release-assets/g2-jtr_QWBT4hJpqr_20220308-1923.pdf

(issued March 2022), 

which recommends against use in healthy children and adolescents 5 years old to 17 years old. 

This now includes recommendations against COVID-19 vaccination among infants and children under 5 years old, 

which has since been issued under Emergency Use Authorization.
