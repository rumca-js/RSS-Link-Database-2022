The next mainline Pokemon game is almost here, and with it come a handful of exciting changes. Here are some of the biggest so far!

In this video, Jake Dekker breaks down some of the most exciting changes coming to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. These changes range world design to gameplay.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet kicks off the 9th generation of Pokemon in the colorful Paldea region. Players can freely explore an open world and catch wild Pokemon wandering around the world. You will be able to create your own trainer and chase any of the three story quests as you see fit.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet come to the Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

Wild Hearts' inspirations are obvious, but its unique high-speed crafting system creates a novel way to ground and defeat gigantic beasts.

The easy line to draw from Wild Hearts--the upcoming hunting game from publishers EA and Koei Tecmo and developer Omega Force is Capcom's Monster Hunter. Wild Hearts is a game about exploring large open areas, alone or with two other players, to take down gigantic monsters that move around the map as you fight them. And the developers don't entirely shy away from that comparison--but they're aspiring to do something much more than replicate Monster Hunter.
