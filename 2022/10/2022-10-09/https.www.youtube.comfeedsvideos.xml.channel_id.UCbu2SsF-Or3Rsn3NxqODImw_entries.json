Wild Hearts is a game about exploring large open areas, alone or with two other players, to take down gigantic monsters that move around the map as you fight them. And the developers don't entirely shy away from that comparison--but they're aspiring to do something much more than replicate Monster Hunter.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbZmW-GAT30", "date_published": "2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II Squad Up Official Trailer", "description": "Squad up in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 coming October 28th!
