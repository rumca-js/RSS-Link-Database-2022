First, it can do something I am not capable of. Second, it involves computer vision, mechanics, some sort of artificial intelligence, and 3D printing. And third: It\u2019s so cool that I can show it to friends and brag about it. What do you want more? I know: It should be easy to build and not be too expensive. So, let\u2019s build one. I can\u2019t wait.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\n\nESP32 Board (take 30-pin version): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBrbsqR\n25kG servos: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_De3cs4T\nMale header: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DF1yJAL\nFemale header: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dl0NNKj\nPCB (also big ones): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlmZxB5\nGitHub: https://github.com/AndreaFavero71/CUBOTino_base_version\nInstructable: https://www.instructables.com/CUBOTino-a-Small-Simple-3D-Printed-Inexpensive-Rub/\nAutonomous Robot: https://youtu.be/dEOLhvVMcUg\nHerbert's Homepage: http://kociemba.org/index.html\nServo hack: https://youtu.be/vbiWDpHkuxc\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
