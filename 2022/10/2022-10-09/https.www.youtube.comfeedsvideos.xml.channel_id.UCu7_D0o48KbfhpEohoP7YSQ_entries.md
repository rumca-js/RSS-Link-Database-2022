When I saw the CUBOTino,I knew: I wanted to build one! First, it can do something I am not capable of. Second, it involves computer vision, mechanics, some sort of artificial intelligence, and 3D printing. And third: It’s so cool that I can show it to friends and brag about it. What do you want more? I know: It should be easy to build and not be too expensive. So, let’s build one. I can’t wait.
