The Doppelmayr Garaventa Monorack is a decades-old product. I've no idea how I missed it before. But for the third video in the Monorail Trilogy, this isn't an advert: I'm just happy to be proved wrong. â–ª More about the Monorack: https://www.doppelmayr.com/products/monorack/

Previously, Wuppertal in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4KZLcvMQWg (I'm not proud of this video -- the Tim Traveller has done a much better video on the system here, and you should probably watch that instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFh6wFTJiQ )

And the Roadmachines monorail in 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irv3KJR6B80

(Thanks also to Grotto de Peo in Ronco sopra Ascona. If you're ever in the area, their food is delicious.)
