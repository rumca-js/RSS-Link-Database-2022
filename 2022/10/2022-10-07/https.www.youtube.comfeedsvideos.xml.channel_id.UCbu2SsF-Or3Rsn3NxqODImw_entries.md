Getting a Steam Deck just got a lot easier, Hideo Kojima is teasing his next project again, and Forza Horizon 5 is getting its biggest update yet.
#SteamDeck #HideoKojima #ForzaHorizon5 

Nothing feels quite like good news on a Friday! For those of you still looking to order a Steam Deck, you’re in luck because you no longer have to make a reservation or wait in a virtual line to buy one. Instead, you can buy it on demand--you know, the way you purchase everything else in your life… Well, except a PS5. Valve has also unveiled the device's promised docking station, which costs $89 and ships in 1-2 weeks. This premium accessory includes not only HDMI, Displayport, and 3 USB 3.1 connectors, but also an Ethernet port.

In a tweet announcing the Deck’s new availability, Valve also noted a few nice features that were added in a recent update. These include expanded docking station options, simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboards, better trackpad typing, and improved stability in offline mode. It also includes several advanced control commands, including remapping certain commands when holding a button, as well as nested menus for more complicated PC games.

But even though the wait for more Steam Deck is over, the wait for Hideo Kojima’s next game is still going. However it seems you won’t have to wait much longer, as his studio Kojima Productions begins to pull the curtain back on its next project, revealing that the actress Elle Fanning will appear in it. Kojima revealed this as part of PAX Australia, which is going on now in Melbourne.

The first teaser for the mysterious game was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show last month. Additional teasers are coming, and if they follow tradition, a major game event might again be the host. If that's the case, the next big gaming event this year is Gamescom Asia at the end of October. After that, Kojima's pal Geoff Keighley is hosting The Game Awards in December.

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new hit Netflix anime based on CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077, isn't just set in Night City, but it just about every scene is actually a location from the game. So, here is Mapping Out Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.
#cyberpunkedgerunners #edgerunners #cyberpunk2077 

In this Cyberpunk: Edgerunners location guide, we take you from Arasaka Tower and the Corpo Plaza, with its holo koi fish, to the Megabuildings of Santa Domingo and Japantown, where characters like David Martinez and Lucy reside.

From stunning views to trying to Parkour our way up a Megabuiding, this is a full stop guide of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

When I first started Cyberpunk Edgerunners, I thought: Oh, cool! They included locations from Cyberpunk 2077 like the Memorial Park near Arasaka Tower with the holo Koi Fish. Or - of course, important locations like the Afterlife bar. And… in doing research and some exploration, that was when I discovered that the number of locations shown in Edgerunners that you can find in Cyberpunk 2077 is staggering.
