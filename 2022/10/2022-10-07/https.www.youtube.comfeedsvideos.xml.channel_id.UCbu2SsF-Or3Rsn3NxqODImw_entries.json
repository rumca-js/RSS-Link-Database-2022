For those of you still looking to order a Steam Deck, you\u2019re in luck because you no longer have to make a reservation or wait in a virtual line to buy one. Instead, you can buy it on demand--you know, the way you purchase everything else in your life\u2026 Well, except a PS5. Valve has also unveiled the device's promised docking station, which costs $89 and ships in 1-2 weeks. This premium accessory includes not only HDMI, Displayport, and 3 USB 3.1 connectors, but also an Ethernet port.\n\nIn a tweet announcing the Deck\u2019s new availability, Valve also noted a few nice features that were added in a recent update. These include expanded docking station options, simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboards, better trackpad typing, and improved stability in offline mode. It also includes several advanced control commands, including remapping certain commands when holding a button, as well as nested menus for more complicated PC games.\n\nBut even though the wait for more Steam Deck is over, the wait for Hideo Kojima\u2019s next game is still going. However it seems you won\u2019t have to wait much longer, as his studio Kojima Productions begins to pull the curtain back on its next project, revealing that the actress Elle Fanning will appear in it. Kojima revealed this as part of PAX Australia, which is going on now in Melbourne.\n\nThe first teaser for the mysterious game was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show last month. Additional teasers are coming, and if they follow tradition, a major game event might again be the host. If that's the case, the next big gaming event this year is Gamescom Asia at the end of October. After that, Kojima's pal Geoff Keighley is hosting The Game Awards in December.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Steam Deck\n01:10 - Hideo Kojima\n02:20 - Forza Horizon 5 Update", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU_VmmeJRF4", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mapping Out Cyberpunk Edgerunners.| Cyberpunk 2077", "description": "Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new hit Netflix anime based on CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077, isn't just set in Night City, but it just about every scene is actually a location from the game.

And\u2026 in doing research and some exploration, that was when I discovered that the number of locations shown in Edgerunners that you can find in Cyberpunk 2077 is staggering.\n\nIf you enjoy this video, make sure to check out more from GameSpot on Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiUVGLc9KCU", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary Official Trailer", "description": "Celebrate 30 years of Mortal Kombat with this latest anniversary trailer featuring video games, to movies, to animation. \n\nAs part of the anniversary, Klassic Movie Raiden will arrive in Mortal Kombat Mobile beginning Oct. 7 through Oct. 11, featuring actor Christopher Lambert\u2019s character likeness and voice from the 1995 film. \n\n#mortalkombat #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym2_AaBCjqg", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Kiriko Official Cinematic Trailer", "description": "The protector of Kanezaka strikes again.
