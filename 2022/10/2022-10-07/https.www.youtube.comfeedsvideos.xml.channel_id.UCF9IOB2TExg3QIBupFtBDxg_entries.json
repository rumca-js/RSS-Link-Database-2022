This includes people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. \n\nBack to the JAMA study\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends offering the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to breastfeeding individuals\n\nalthough the possible passage of vaccine mRNAs in breast milk resulting in infants\u2019 exposure at younger than 6 months was not investigated. \n\nThis study investigated whether the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA can be detected in the expressed breast milk (EBM) of lactating individuals\n\nreceiving the vaccination within 6 months after delivery.\n\nN =11\n\nModerna mRNA-1273 vaccine (n\u2009=\u20095)\n\nPfizer BNT162b2 vaccine (n\u2009=\u20096)\n\nSamples of EBM were collected before vaccination (control),\n\nand for 5 days postvaccination. \n\n131 EBM samples were collected\n\n(1 hour to 5 days after vaccine administration)\n\nThe presence of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA in different milk fractions\n\nassayed using 2-step quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction. \n\nResults\n\nTrace amounts of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were detected in 7 samples from 5 different participants,\n\nat various times up to 45 hours postvaccination\n\nNo vaccine mRNA was detected in prevaccination\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe sporadic presence and trace quantities of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA detected in EBM suggest that breastfeeding after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is safe,\n\nparticularly beyond 48 hours after vaccination. \n\nThese data demonstrate for the first time the biodistribution of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA to mammary cells,\n\nand the potential ability of tissue EVs to package the vaccine mRNA that can be transported to distant cells. \n\nIn rats\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365915300535?via%3Dihub\n\nUp to 3 days following intramuscular administration, \n\nlow vaccine mRNA levels were detected in the heart, lung, testis, and brain tissues, indicating tissue biodistribution\n\nVaccine administration ---- lipid nanoparticles containing the vaccine mRNA ----- mammary glands (hematogenous and/or lymphatic routes)\n\nVaccine mRNA released into mammary cell cytosol ---- recruited into developing EVs ------ secreted in EBM\n\nCaution is warranted about breastfeeding children younger than 6 months in the first 48 hours after maternal vaccination until more safety studies are conducted. \n\n\nCOVID-19 medical misinformation policy\n\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785\n\nClaims about COVID-19 vaccinations that contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the WHO\nClaims that an approved COVID-19 vaccine will cause death, infertility, miscarriage, autism or contraction of other infectious diseases\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123\n\nVaccine safety: content alleging that vaccines cause chronic side effects, outside of rare side effects that are recognised by health authorities\nEfficacy of vaccines: content claiming that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease \nIngredients in vaccines: content misrepresenting the substances contained in vaccines", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uF1oPyh8OY", "date_published": "2022-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
