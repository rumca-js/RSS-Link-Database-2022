Nvidia's RTX 4090 is the new king of GPUs. It laughs at last generation ray tracing performance, it shrugs off the most demanding of games, it... recommends a power supply with 850 to 1000 watts?! There's got to be a better way - and it starts with undervolting.

The team at LMG are a diverse bunch with a wide-ranging skillset - and they often use those skills to cast a critical eye on the choices Linus makes with his setups. Today though, we play the uno reverse card: it’s time for Linus and Luke to judge the choices their own staff make, and publicly roast their setups!
