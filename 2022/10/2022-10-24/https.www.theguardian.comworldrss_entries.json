We\u2019ve identified obviously, some of that the short term work and that will be reported in the budget.</p><p>But this spending audit should should keep going. We should do it in every budget, just to make sure that we\u2019re constantly looking at ways we\u2019re spending money and I think the Australian public would expect us to do that, that it\u2019s not always adding in new spending when there\u2019s \u2026 need that arises, and there will be, but we\u2019re looking at existing expenditure as well and how we can reuse that or \u2026 realign it with \u2026 new investments.</p><p>It\u2019s not exclusively infrastructure. We are finding savings across government. We have gone to every single department and ask them to look at their programs to identify programs that don\u2019t need to be done any longer or don\u2019t align with government priorities and where we\u2019ve been able to return some money to the budget we\u2019re doing that.</p><p>The other part of it is actually not adding new funding to things but using existing funding to fund some of our our priorities. So it\u2019s been a very useful exercise and I think $22bn is a pretty reasonable figure to have achieved over just, you know, a couple of months in government.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/24/australia-politics-live-budget-jim-chalmers-cuts-savings-outlook-economy-labor-gdp\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/24/australia-politics-live-budget-jim-chalmers-cuts-savings-outlook-economy-labor-gdp", "date_published": "2022-10-24 05:48:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "Australia live flood updates: more than 130 warnings in place across NSW; Echuca locals watch levee ahead of expected peak", "description": "<p>NSW police say a body has been found in the search for a woman who was swept into flood waters in Cooyal Creek at Gulgong </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/24/nsw-weather-almost-entire-state-at-flood-risk-as-lismore-braces-for-third-major-event-this-year\">NSW weather: almost entire state at flood risk as Lismore braces for third major event this year</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/23/morning-mail-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/13/afternoon-update-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up?CMP=cvau_sfl\">afternoon</a> news emails, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p><strong>Daniel Andrews says there will be a flood update at 11.30am</strong></p><p>Victorian premier, <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, is at a school in Seaford in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, announcing $1.6bn to upgrade schools and kindergartens.
