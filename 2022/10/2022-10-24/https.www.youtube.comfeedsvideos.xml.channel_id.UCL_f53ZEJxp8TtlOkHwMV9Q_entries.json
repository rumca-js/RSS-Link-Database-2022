Peterson and Dr. Dennis McKenna discuss the science behind psychedelics, the entities found through the looking glass, the current pharmaceutical approach to long life, and why it needs to change.\n\nDr. Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later Dennis would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field. Today, Dennis tours and lectures, while also running the  Mckenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, which seeks to uncover the mysteries of consciousness held within the realm of botany and pharmacology.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nMcKenna Academy: https://mckenna.academy\n\nThe Experiment at La Chorrera https://mckenna.academy/events?id=32 \n\nESPD55 Livestream Symposium ESPD55.com\n\nThose interested in donations may contact connect@mckenna.academy\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nElysium Health - Save 25% off Basis monthly subscriptions with code JBP25: https://trybasis.com/Jordan\n\nShopify - Get a FREE 14-day trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:40) intro\n(2:33) Dr. Dennis McKenna now\n(6:47) What is ethnopharmacology?\n(12:45) Ayahuasca\n(26:02) Hierarchy of concepts\n(30:00) The Reality Hallucination\n(43:50) Breaking down hyper reality \n(49:30) Commonalities of entities\n(55:50) The intrinsic form of personality\n(1:00:15) Ritual, bad shamans\n(1:02:58) Carl Rogers, voluntary exposure\n(1:09:15) Roland Griffiths, the flaw in how medicine is practiced\n(1:12:05) Impending mortality\n(1:24:45) Dr. McKenna\u2019s future plans\n(1:26:19) Looking back at a life long career \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #DennisMcKenna #psychedelics #science #drugs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJE8HYFrkT4", "date_published": "2022-10-24 20:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
