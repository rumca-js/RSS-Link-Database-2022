Bayonetta, the angel-hunting umbra witch is back for her 3rd installment in the much beloved PlatinumGames title. With the planned release date of October 28, 2022 fast approaching, here is Everything You Need to Know about Bayonetta 3.
#bayonetta #bayonetta3 #gamespot 

The original Bayonetta was created and directed by Hideki Kamiya. The same man behind Devil May Cry, and the advent of the arcadey combo-heavy 3D action game style. So, after creating a 2D game in a similar style via Viewtiful Joe, Kamiya created what would become another beloved combo-heavy action game -  Bayonetta.
Bayonetta took what Devil May Cry started, and added a stylistic new protagonist in its titular character, as well as stand out, gigantic boss fights. Her clothing is her hair, which she also uses for magic and to summon demons, and there’s overt sexual overtones throughout.

November’s free games for PlayStation Plus and Amazon Prime Gaming have reportedly leaked. 
#GamingNews #PSPlus #PS5 

Nioh 2 is a yokai-slaying action game from Team Ninja that combines the pinpoint swordplay of Ninja Gaiden with the mechanics of Dark Souls. If you're up for that sort of thing, it's one of the best Souls-likes around, and is definitely worth a look. Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of Nioh 2 will be free.

The Lego Harry Potter Collection is not the most recent Lego video game out there, as it was released in 2016, but it's regarded as one of the best by reviewers and fans alike. This collection combines Years 1-4 and Years 5-7 into one game. If you've already blasted your way through the recent Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, it's a good next step.

The physics-based puzzle game Heavenly Bodies rounds out November's selection of games. It allows players to explore a zero-gravity environment, solve puzzles, and collect space goodies. The PS5 and PS4 versions of Heavenly Bodies will be available to claim.

Fallout: New Vegas is developed by Obsidian Entertainment originally released in 2010 for consoles and PC. New Vegas improved on the gameplay systems presented in Fallout 3 and offered a wider mission variety. With a huge open world and a huge collection of sidequests, New Vegas was engaging even after completing the main campaign.

Original Bayonetta voice actor responds to backlash, confirms she was offered $15k for Bayonetta 3.
#GamingNews #Bayonetta3 #Reaction

Voice actor Hellena Taylor originally said she was offered $4,000 to appear as the voice of Bayonetta in Bayonetta 3, a figure she said was "insulting." Hellena was later replaced by veteran voice actor Jennifer Hale and Platinum Games put out a statement in support of Hale, who received a wave of criticism and backlash. 
After Taylor's claims went viral, Bloomberg published a report that said she was offered around $15,000, a figure Taylor has since confirmed to be accurate. In her new Twitter thread, Taylor said she was initially offered $10,000 total to play Bayonetta in the third game, but she deemed it to be too low and wrote a letter to Bayonetta 3 director Hideki Kamiya asking him to pay her what she was worth.
Taylor said, "I thought that as a creative, he would understand. He replied saying how much he valued my contribution to the game and how much the fans wanted me to voice the game.” She added that Platinum Games offered her an additional $5,000 for a total of $15,000, but she declined the offer. Taylor then explained, “I heard nothing from them for 11 months. They then offered me a flat fee to voice some lines for 4,000 dollars.”
Another major release coming out soon is God of War Ragnarok. Unfortunately for fans who wanted to go into the experience with fresh eyes, the game is leaking ahead of time. A Twitter account is posting screenshots of the game that contain spoilers, according to VGC, which has seen the account.

The Batman Arkham franchise has grown to become an extensive series with a timeline that glides its way through 5 mainline games, a handful of spin-offs, a plethora of tie-in comic books, a novel, a VR experience, and a movie. But how does everything tie together?
