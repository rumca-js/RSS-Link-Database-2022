The same man behind Devil May Cry, and the advent of the arcadey combo-heavy 3D action game style. So, after creating a 2D game in a similar style via Viewtiful Joe, Kamiya created what would become another beloved combo-heavy action game -  Bayonetta.\nBayonetta took what Devil May Cry started, and added a stylistic new protagonist in its titular character, as well as stand out, gigantic boss fights. Her clothing is her hair, which she also uses for magic and to summon demons, and there\u2019s overt sexual overtones throughout.\nBayonetta 3 releases October 28, 2022\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:18 - Development\n1:46 - Gameplay\n4:58 - Story\n5:36 - Controversy\n8:08 - Release Date", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNdtz6JAc6w", "date_published": "2022-10-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Free PS Plus For November 2022 Leaked | GameSpot News", "description": "November\u2019s free games for PlayStation Plus and Amazon Prime Gaming have reportedly leaked.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #PSPlus #PS5 \n\nNioh 2 is a yokai-slaying action game from Team Ninja that combines the pinpoint swordplay of Ninja Gaiden with the mechanics of Dark Souls.
