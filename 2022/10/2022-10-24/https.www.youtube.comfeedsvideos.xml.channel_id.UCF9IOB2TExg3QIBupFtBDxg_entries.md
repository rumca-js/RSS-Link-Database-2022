No immediate loosening of zero-Covid strategy

Zero-Covid, people's war to stop the spread of the virus

Recent weeks

Tens of millions, confined home

60 towns and cities

Dynamic zero-Covid, linked to Mr Xi

Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes, travel restrictions

Trains out of Xinjiang suspended

Roadblocks

Widespread reports, food and medicine

Quarantine centres, family separations

IDs linked to health code apps

No vaccine compulsion

(Local vaccines only)

Professor Liang Wannian, government Covid expert panel

Zero-Covid might come to an end?

It's hard to say

Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. 

We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines.

So the heart is a muscular structure, tell us about this muscle

What happens if this myocardium becomes inflammed?

What can cause myocarditis?

How would you recognise myocarditis?

What are the possible outcomes of myocarditis?

How much myocarditis are we seeing now and has this incidence changed of late?

Then much the same series of questions for pericarditis

Getting back to the myocardium, if this is an actively contractile muscle, I guess it needs a good blood supply?

What can go wrong with these coronary arteries?

What is this atherosclerosis and atheroma?

How long does it take for this furring up of the coronary arteries to develop?

Any changes in the rate of development in recent times?

What is a coronary arterial plaque, how can this lead to clots?

Can inflammatory processes lead to plaque instability?

What is a MI, is this the same as a heart attack?

What is a cardiac arrest?

How would a cardiac arrest be treated?

What is the difference between a heart attack and heart failure?

Implications of the Office for National Statistics estimates of Covid-19 vaccine take up in England on the representativeness of its sample population

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364310694_Implications_of_the_Office_for_National_Statistics_estimates_of_Covid-19_vaccine_take_up_in_England_on_the_representativeness_of_its_sample_population?channel=doi&linkId=63459d419cb4fe44f31d90fd&showFulltext=true

Is it important to collect quantitively data to learn about a population group?

Why do we need a representative sample of a population to collect valid data for the population as a whole?

Can you give an example of how a representative sample of a population should be selected?

Which sample is used by the ONS to generate their estimates of covid vaccine take up?

Is this then a skewed sample?

Given that to be included an individual had to have been in the 2011 census and must currently be registered with a GP, how many people are missed out?

Of these 8 million people that are missed out from the ONS data, what proportion of these are unvaccinated?

Are there any other estimates of the proportion of the population vaccinated for comparative purposes?

Does this mean that the sample is not as representative as would be ideal?

If the sample is not representative, how does this effect the validity of their data and hence their conclusions?
