In the UK, this trend is even more widespread, with many outlets which describe themselves as \u201cimpartial\u201d or even \u201cliberal\u201d similarly filling airtime and column inches with spurious \u201cdebates\u201d about trans rights and healthcare.\n\nBut, how does the more openly cruel and hateful transphobia that is more prevalent in the US compare with the supposedly more \u201cpolite\u201d, \u201crespectable\u201d transphobia which cloaks the anti-trans moral panic in the UK?\n\nIn this month\u2019s video, we take a look at a bunch of interviews which have been conducted by mainstream journalists with senior British politicians over the past 18 months and compare them with excerpts from What is a Woman?, the provocative transphobic pseudo-documentary presented by Matt Walsh and released by The Daily Wire earlier this year.\n\nIn doing so, hopefully we can uncover something about the dangers of the so-called \u201ctrans debate\u201d and what journalists and right-wing politicians are really trying to achieve with this current obsession with questions about the definition of womanhood.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\n\n#Transphobia #WhatIsAWoman #TomNicholas", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAMM3l156Oo", "date_published": "2022-10-14 19:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
