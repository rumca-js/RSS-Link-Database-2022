Deep dive into Rings of Power Episode 8: "Alloyed" !  We'll look for all the references to Tolkien's deeper lore, explain what is happening, and I'll give some thoughts along the way.  We now have a 2-year wait until season two - the question is, how does Season 1 score and in what ways does this show need to improve going forward?
