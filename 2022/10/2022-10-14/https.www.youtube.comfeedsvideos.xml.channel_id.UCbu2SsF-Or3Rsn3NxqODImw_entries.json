So here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to, and what I\u2019m not looking forward to in both the campaign & multiplayer.\n\nFrom movie style set pieces, to wicked plot twists, and sick villains, the cod campaigns are something I look forward to every release. Call me casual but I know I\u2019m not the only one who was disappointed when Black Ops 4 didn\u2019t have a campaign. Now so far we\u2019ve only seen the reveal of the Dark Water mission and snippets from the brand new campaign trailer released earlier. Dark Water looked dope to me, but some people online felt that it looked like a rehash of the original Modern Warfare\u2019s opening ship mission which, fair! The cutscenes from the new trailer though? Dude seriously, I had to pause and double take because I thought this was a live-action trailer, the cgi and cutscenes look really awesome and I can not wait to bust it out on my shiny Series X or PC.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, in multiplayer, Activision likes to mess with everything it touches, and a big part of me is warily waiting for something to happen with Modern Warfare 2\u2019s live service model, especially from a \u201cgive me more money\u201d point of view. If not at launch, then almost certainly in future season passes. Modern Warfare 2019 was really tame at launch when it came to cosmetics and microtransactions with a lot of skins being pretty neat mil-sim style stuff. Then along came Warzone and suddenly we got crazier and crazier skins compounded with Black Ops and Vanguard all transitioning their skins across games.\n\nModern Warfare 2 is right around the corner with a weird rolling launch. We\u2019ve got the campaign coming up first in an early access period, then the official base launch with multiplayer, and Warzone 2.0 at its heels with a November launch. We've all enjoyed our time with the multiplayer beta so far so be sure to subscribe for more guides, gameplay, livestreams, and of course our official review score once the game launches. \n\n\nTimestamps: \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:14 Why I'm Excited for the Campaign\n04:02 - Why I'm Excited for the Multiplayer\n07:32 - Campaign & Spec Ops Concerns\n09:24 - The Activision Problem\n\n\n#gaming #cod #modernwarfare2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykkxgTpF9o", "date_published": "2022-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "10 Minutes of Dead Space Remake Gameplay", "description": "Dead Space Remake looks as spooky as ever, and now with a fresh coat of paint in this remake.

This confirmation comes not long after another Activision Blizzard game, Overwatch 2, made headlines for its own controversial SMS policy.\n\nIn a blog post, Activision said a \"text-enabled mobile phone number\" is required for Modern Warfare 2 on PC. This is the same requirement that has been in place for Warzone players on PC since May 2020. Anyone who previously played Warzone on PC won't have to do anything else to get started with Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0. Additionally, people on Steam must link a phone number to play Modern Warfare II, so this requirement is not limited to Battle.net alone.\n\nActivision also provided an update on the efforts it's taking to fight cheating in Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0. Activision's Ricochet anti-cheat system will be available at launch for Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0, and it will be beefed up with \"better detection capabilities, additional access to develop and deploy new mitigation techniques, and expanded freedom to update our security more frequently than ever before.\"\n\nAnd lastly, let's talk about Gotham Knights. The upcoming brawler set in the Batman universe will get a proper four-player co-op mode in late November, a little over a month after the game's October 21 release. Called Heroic Assault, the mode will be added to Gotham Knights as a free update on November 29 and is entirely separate from the main story campaign.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9vVW2yUoxU", "date_published": "2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Poke\u0301mon Scarlet and Poke\u0301mon Violet | Meet Bellibolt!", "description": "Iono\u2019s partner Pok\u00e9mon is Bellibolt, the EleFrog Pok\u00e9mon! \n\nBellibolt expands and contracts its body to generate electricity in an organ that looks like a belly button.

But, was this creepy bio-horror filled world worth the wait?\n#scorn #scorngame #gamespot\n\nScorn is primarily an exploration puzzle game, with most of its gameplay revolving around searching the game's grotesque environment for clues, all while witnessing a number of horrors and disgusting visuals. Your nameless character is on a quest with no forward-facing explanation, so it's up to you to interpret the meaning of your quest and the world around you.\n\nWhile Scorn mostly focuses on exploration and puzzle solving, with the environments themselves often times lending themselves to the puzzles, there are also FPS elements, with your character finding multiple weapons they can use to hold enemies at bay. Of course, like most horror games, ammo is limited, and the enemies are overpowered, meaning you'll want to avoid these encounters at all costs.\n\nWhat is there to discover in Scorn, and how is the game?
