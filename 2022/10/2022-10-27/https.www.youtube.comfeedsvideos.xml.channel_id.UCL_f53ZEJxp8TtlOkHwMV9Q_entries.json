Peterson and Senator Josh Hawley discuss the leftist ideology surrounding men and their diminished worth, the current Republican swing as a result, and the potential future of American politics as we move towards the midterm elections.\n\nSenator Hawley is recognized as one of the nation\u2019s leading constitutional lawyers. He has litigated at the Supreme Court of the United States, the federal courts of appeals, and in state court, fighting for the people\u2019s liberties. He previously fought Obamacare at the Supreme Court \u2014 and won \u2014 as one of the lead attorneys in the landmark Hobby Lobby case. Since taking office in 2019, Senator Hawley has been a leading champion in Congress for working families. He\u2019s worked across the aisle to deliver protections for kids online, led the fight for direct payments to working people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and taken steps to crack down on predatory landlords. Currently, Senator Hawley is writing a book set for a 2023 release.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\u2014 Links \u2014 \n\nFor Senator Josh Hawley\n\nTwitter  https://twitter.com/HawleyMO\n\nSenate page website https://www.hawley.senate.gov/ \n\nPersonal Website https://joshhawley.com/ \n\n\u2014 Sponsors \u2014\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nDr. Peterson's new book: The ABC of Childhood Tragedy.
