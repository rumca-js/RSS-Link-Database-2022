This video may as well be a tribute to Dave Smith, may he rest in peace. I’m playing a Prophet 6, Karina is playing an OB-6, and Will is playing a Prophet 8. What blows my mind is the sheer volume of diverse textures, timbres, sounds, and feelings that can be achieved with these synthesizers. About a year ago, I decided to do a deep dive into the Prophet 6 and learn every knob, every button, every nook and cranny of the keyboard. It took me about a week of watching YouTube tutorials on each section of the instrument to learn the whole thing. My respect for Dave and his craftsmanship grew by an order of magnitude that week. I knew he was a genius, but the level of detail, musicality, and artistry that he had engineered into this instrument was a feat of imagination of execution at the highest level. I am an unapologetic Dave Smith fan boy.

As if that might not be enough, Dave invented a protocol that he called Universal Synthesizer Interface to allow synthesizers to transmit and receive information from each other. After some tweaking and revisions, he evolved the protocol and brought other manufacturers on board (Oberheim and Roland), and renamed it “Music Instrument Digital Interface,” or MIDI, which is still the standard today for transmitting and receiving musical data (pitch, velocity, etc.).

All that to say, Dave Smith was the SHIT. What a career, what a life, what a hero.

Thank you, Dave, for everything you gave the world, and thank you for giving us these incredible sounds we used to make this song.
