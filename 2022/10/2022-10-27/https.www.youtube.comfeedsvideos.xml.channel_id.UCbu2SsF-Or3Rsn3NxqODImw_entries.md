Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC and Xbox doesn’t have a cross-play toggle, players don’t Santa Sena Border Crossing and Burger King and Activision team up for an exclusive skin. 
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

Games with cross-play support generally offer the ability to toggle it off, since some console players might not want to play with PC players using mouse and keyboard, while some PC players prefer not to play with console players that have aim-assist. For some unknown reason, this option in Modern Warfare 2 is only available to PS5 and PS4 players, meaning Xbox and PC players are stuck being lumped into cross-play lobbies unless developer Infinity Ward makes a change.

Xbox players do have the ability to circumvent this omission at a system level, toggling off support for cross-play that will apply to all games on the system. If you want to disable cross-play at a system level on Xbox, you can follow these steps:

Go to the Settings menu on the Xbox console
Go to the General tab and choose ‘Online safety & family’
Choose ‘Privacy & online safety’ then ‘Xbox Live privacy’
Choose ‘View details & customise’, then ‘Communication & multiplayer’
On the tab that says “You can play with people outside Xbox Live’, choose ‘Block’

Santa Sena Border Crossing places players on a highway packed with an unthinkable number of cars. Most maps feature a square or rectangle layout, but Santa Sena Border Crossing is a very narrow and linear map with little escape from the cars.

Some players took to social media to call it the Picadilly of Modern Warfare 2, as Picadilly was a Modern Warfare 2019 map that also received a lot of talk and negative attention over its design.

## The Callisto Protocol Canceled In Japan, Here's Why | GameSpot News

The Callisto Protocol gets canceled in Japan, Gotham Knights is getting lots of fixes and Modern Warfare 2 isn’t what you think it is.
#GamingNews #TheCallistoProtocol #PS5

The Callisto Protocol will not be released in Japan due to the game failing to receive a rating there, presumably due to its violence and gore. The studio said via its Japanese Twitter account that the localized version for Japan will be discontinued and that anyone who preordered will get a refund.

The Callisto Protocol takes place in a prison on one of Jupiter's moons, Callisto. The game promises to be extremely violent and gory. In fact, Striking Dance boss Glen Schofield said the development team looked at grisly car crash scenes for inspiration.

The Callisto Protocol launches on December 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game could spawn a sequel, as Schofield has said he has ideas for additional entries in the series.

In less scary news, Gotham Knights developer Warner Bros. Montreal has released a new update for the game that aims to improve performance issues on PC, with a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch coming soon. This is a small patch, but a more substantial update will follow it as the studio looks to add a "mix of needed fixes that have popped up since launch" for the game, specifically frame rate stability on consoles.
