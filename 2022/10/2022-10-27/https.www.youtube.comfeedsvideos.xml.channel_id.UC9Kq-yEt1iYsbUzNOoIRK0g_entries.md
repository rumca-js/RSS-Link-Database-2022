Dwayne Johnson has been trying to get his Black Adam made for nearly fifteen years. Now, in 2022, it’s finally come to life. And one thing is for sure, it’s a movie that came out, and now the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe has been affected in some way probably.

Black Adam definitely raises some questions. Like why are Atom Smasher and Cyclone even in this movie? What was up with that Eternium stuff that make Black Adam weak? Why was that kid always skateboarding? Is Black Adam a bad guy just because he keeps saying he is? Why can’t Doctor Fate stop removing his helmet all the time?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Black Adam!
