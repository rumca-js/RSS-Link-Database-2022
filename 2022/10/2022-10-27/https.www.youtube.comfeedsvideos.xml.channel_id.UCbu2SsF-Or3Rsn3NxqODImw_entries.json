For some unknown reason, this option in Modern Warfare 2 is only available to PS5 and PS4 players, meaning Xbox and PC players are stuck being lumped into cross-play lobbies unless developer Infinity Ward makes a change.\n\nXbox players do have the ability to circumvent this omission at a system level, toggling off support for cross-play that will apply to all games on the system. If you want to disable cross-play at a system level on Xbox, you can follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Settings menu on the Xbox console\nGo to the General tab and choose \u2018Online safety & family\u2019\nChoose \u2018Privacy & online safety\u2019 then \u2018Xbox Live privacy\u2019\nChoose \u2018View details & customise\u2019, then \u2018Communication & multiplayer\u2019\nOn the tab that says \u201cYou can play with people outside Xbox Live\u2019, choose \u2018Block\u2019\n\nSanta Sena Border Crossing places players on a highway packed with an unthinkable number of cars.

The studio said via its Japanese Twitter account that the localized version for Japan will be discontinued and that anyone who preordered will get a refund.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol takes place in a prison on one of Jupiter's moons, Callisto. The game promises to be extremely violent and gory. In fact, Striking Dance boss Glen Schofield said the development team looked at grisly car crash scenes for inspiration.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol launches on December 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game could spawn a sequel, as Schofield has said he has ideas for additional entries in the series.\n\nIn less scary news, Gotham Knights developer Warner Bros. Montreal has released a new update for the game that aims to improve performance issues on PC, with a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch coming soon. This is a small patch, but a more substantial update will follow it as the studio looks to add a \"mix of needed fixes that have popped up since launch\" for the game, specifically frame rate stability on consoles.\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - The Callisto Protocol\n01:20 - Gotham Knights\n02:06 - Modern Warfare 2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfJpxlsh_ks", "date_published": "2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
