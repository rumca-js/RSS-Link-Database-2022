Astyn Turr & Christine Noel", "description": "This video may as well be a tribute to Dave Smith, may he rest in peace. I\u2019m playing a Prophet 6, Karina is playing an OB-6, and Will is playing a Prophet 8. What blows my mind is the sheer volume of diverse textures, timbres, sounds, and feelings that can be achieved with these synthesizers. About a year ago, I decided to do a deep dive into the Prophet 6 and learn every knob, every button, every nook and cranny of the keyboard. It took me about a week of watching YouTube tutorials on each section of the instrument to learn the whole thing. My respect for Dave and his craftsmanship grew by an order of magnitude that week. I knew he was a genius, but the level of detail, musicality, and artistry that he had engineered into this instrument was a feat of imagination of execution at the highest level. I am an unapologetic Dave Smith fan boy.\n\nAs if that might not be enough, Dave invented a protocol that he called Universal Synthesizer Interface to allow synthesizers to transmit and receive information from each other. After some tweaking and revisions, he evolved the protocol and brought other manufacturers on board (Oberheim and Roland), and renamed it \u201cMusic Instrument Digital Interface,\u201d or MIDI, which is still the standard today for transmitting and receiving musical data (pitch, velocity, etc.).\n\nAll that to say, Dave Smith was the SHIT. What a career, what a life, what a hero.\n\nThank you, Dave, for everything you gave the world, and thank you for giving us these incredible sounds we used to make this song.\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Th94Ql\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of Des'ree's \"You Gotta Be\" by Magaziine, Astyn Turr & Christine Noel.\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nVocals/Arrangement: Astyn Turr & Christine Noel\nSynth: Jack Conte, Karina DePiano, Will Gramling\nTrigger pads: Ben Rose\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Bill Mims\nAssistant Engineer: Jack Corbett\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nProducer: Ben Rose\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nAD: Michael Kiaunis\nDP: Austin Hughes\nCamera Operators: Nate Cuboi, James Hull\nGaffer: Nash White\nKey Grip: Jesse Mejia\nVideo Editor/Colorist: Dominic Mercurio\n\nMIDI LED Keyboard Stands created by: Jim Wheaton from https://chameleoninstrumentlights.com\n\nRecorded at Stay Lucky Studios in Los Angeles.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3S_X0MH2ts", "date_published": "2022-10-27 15:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
