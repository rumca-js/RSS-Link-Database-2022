MarkBench Development and Feature Request: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1460878-markbench-development-and-feature-requests/

Benchmarking takes a lot of time. Time that we don’t have. And with our renewed focus on bringing more and better data to our reviews, if we want to create a quality video in time for release, something has got to give. So we automated it. Meet MarkBench! The benchmarking software that our lab is developing for use for our reviews and future Labs content. This exact software was used in our Nvidia RTX 4090 review AND AMD Ryzen 7000 series reviews. Take a look!

Linus vs Dennis wasn't exactly fair, so this time Jake is going to see if he can do a better job than Linus when it comes to virtually building computers in the new and improved PC Building Simulator 2.
