Transmission within a defined sub-population.
Out of 3,390 cases with known gender, 

99% are men, and there are 45 women. 

Nowcast and growth

Incidence remains low.

Multiple factors in reduction

Vaccination, (moderate confidence)

(hospital room of infected patients)

No confirmed instances of airborne transmission

Limited household transmission

Assessment (confidence): Transmitting primarily through close or sexual contact (moderate)

Observed clinical severity

No reported deaths in the UK

Morbidity amongst people admitted to hospital, severe pain, secondary bacterial infection

Encephalitis, reported, appears uncommon

Janine Small
Pfizer’s president of international developed markets
Testifying before the European Union Parliament, Monday 10th October
Dutch MEP Rob Roos
‘Was the Pfizer Covid vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?
If not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee? And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I’m looking forward to it.”

Ms Small 
“Regarding the question around, um, did we know about stopping the immunisation before it entered the market? No
Therefore
Pfizer Covid vaccine was not tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market

Ms Small 
you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market, 
and from that point of view we had to do everything at risk. 
I think Dr Bourla, even though he’s not here, would turn around and say to you himself, ‘If not us then who?’”
Ms Small said Dr Bourla “actually felt the importance of what was going on in the world, 
and therefore as a result of that, we actually, um, spent $US2 billion, at risk, of self-funded money from Pfizer, 
to be able to research, develop and manufacture at risk, to be able to make sure that we were in a position to be able to help with the pandemic”.
Mr Roos
scandalous
“Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that ‘you do it for others’
“Now this turned out to be a cheap lie. This should be exposed.”
