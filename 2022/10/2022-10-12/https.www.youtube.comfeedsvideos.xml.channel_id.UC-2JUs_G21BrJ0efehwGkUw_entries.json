Holy moly. 1 million is a very large number... We filmed this little behind the scenes a couple years ago and thought releasing it on our \"million subs\" week might be fun and fitting. Hope you don't mind it being slightly outdated. OK, before I start tearing up... Scary Pockets is a platform for all the amazing musicians and singers in LA (and those passing through). This is their channel and their band. From the bottom of our hearts, Jack and I want to thank them for agreeing to appear in these videos with our goofy faces, and for contributing their genius to these arrangements. And of course, thank YOU for watching... We love you. Even the haters! Keep the comments coming... I read them all :)\n\nStore: https://www.scarypocketsfunk.com\nPatreon: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/patreon\nListen on Spotify: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/spotify\n\nTip Jar: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/tips\nInstagram: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/instagram\nFacebook: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/facebook\nDiscord: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/discord\nSubscribe: http://modal.scarypocketsfunk.com/subscribe\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nExecutive Producer: Joe Smith\nSenior Producer: John Picklap\nEditor: Shelby Smith\nDP: Ricky Chavez\n\n#ScaryPockets #Funk #documentary", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3zI_0sGTuU", "date_published": "2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
