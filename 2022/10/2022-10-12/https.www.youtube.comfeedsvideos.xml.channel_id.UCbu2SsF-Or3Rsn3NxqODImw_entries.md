We’re going to go over some of the best horror games to play right now on your Steam Deck. Here are the conditions: the game has to run well on Deck and it has to be a good fit for the handheld/on-the-go experience.
#Gaming #SteamDeck #PCGaming

Spooky season is in full swing and what better way to celebrate than to play some scary games. It's also a great time to visit pumpkin patches or haunted houses, so while you travel, why not take those games with you. The Steam Deck is the perfect way to play all those scream inducing experiences while on-the-go. 

This list consists of games like Dead Space, a survival-horror game in which you play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair a ship’s communication system after it mysteriously goes offline. Unfortunately for him, that repair job quickly turns into a battle for survival when he finds the ship is a floating human slaughterhouse. 

Dying Light 2: Stay Human which takes place 15 years after the events of the first game. In it you play as Aiden Caldwell, a member of a group of freelance runners and you’re on a quest to find your sister Mia.

And Let’s be honest, there are a lot of Resident Evil games out there and at this point in the series they could have a Steam Deck video all to themselves. So for this list we’re just going to focus on the latest release, Resident Evil Village. The game picks up 3 years after the story of Resident Evil 7 and continues to focus on Ethan Winters. After rescuing his wife Mia from the Baker house–spoilers–and subsequently getting saved by Resident Evil franchise mainstay Chris Redfield–extra spoilers–the couple try to restart their lives in Europe. One thing leads to another and you, aka Ethan, find yourself drowning in another crazy trauma inducing situation.

Elden Ring may be getting new locations and ray tracing according to a new report, Plus, Steam’s mobile app gets a major update.
#GamingNews #EldenRing #Steam 

Elden Ring was the loudest game in early 2022, but in the past couple of months From Software have been fairly quiet. However now the game has a new patch available that rebalances PvP, lays the groundwork for a wider PvP reshuffle and has added hidden references to new maps. If the back to back use of ‘player vs player’ didn’t give it away, Patch 1.07 is almost exclusively multiplayer-focused. The biggest change is the addition of separate damage scaling for PvP battles, a change that the game's community has lobbied for since its release. As for the tease of new locations, prolific Souls hacker Lance McDonald claims this patch also adds references to maps that aren't in the game yet on a raw code level. It also adds some code that appears to be related to ray-tracing options that don't exist yet in the options menu, either.

The Steam Mobile App has gotten a complete aesthetic overhaul and a bunch of new features to boot, including new login options and remote downloads. As in previous releases, the Steam Mobile App enables two-factor authentication on Steam. However, more login options are now available, including scanning a QR code with your phone in the app or sign in confirmation. You can now also customize notifications, enabling you to receive notice whenever a game on your wishlist goes on sale or you get a friend request.

This month PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members can expect a number of noteworthy games, from lengthy RPGs like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, to tighter experiences like the beloved Inside. And if spooky vibes are what you’re after then the addition of The Medium may speak to you. One of the most notable additions to the catalog is GTA Vice City Definitive Edition, a game that launched alongside remasters of its violent siblings GTA 3 and San Andreas, but also with tons of bugs and glitches that hampered fans enjoyment.

There are also a number of other Assassin's Creed games available, including the China, India, and Russia entries in the Chronicles series.

A variety of PlayStation Classics are available in October as well (for Premium members), including Yakuza 3-5 Remastered, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and Limbo, among others.

All of the games will be available to download from the PlayStation Store starting October 18.

Scorn is an upcoming first person survival horror game by Ebb Software that takes visual inspiration from the likes of H. R. Giger and Zdizislaw Beksinski. The game releases soon, so - here is Everything You Need to Know About Scorn.
#scorn #scorngame #gamespot 

Scorn is focused on environmental storytelling with a slower, more methodical gameplay approach. According to the team, there are no cut-scenes, and every bit of storytelling happens in-game. 

The area you’ll be traveling is a techno-organic hellscape, where the technology of the world fuses with organic masses, including your own. It’s structured like a dungeon, and intended to be maze-like. From what we’ve seen so far, much of your time running through this labyrinth will be spent avoiding enemies, while finding organic parts of the world in order to help you progress.

Scorn will be released this Friday, October 14, 2022. Scorn releases for PC on platforms like Steam, Epic, and GOG, and will also be available for XBox Series X/S and Game Pass. So, if you have Game Pass, this might be the perfect way to spend Halloween.
