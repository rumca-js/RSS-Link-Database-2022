Here are the conditions: the game has to run well on Deck and it has to be a good fit for the handheld/on-the-go experience.\n#Gaming #SteamDeck #PCGaming\n\nSpooky season is in full swing and what better way to celebrate than to play some scary games. It's also a great time to visit pumpkin patches or haunted houses, so while you travel, why not take those games with you. The Steam Deck is the perfect way to play all those scream inducing experiences while on-the-go.\u00a0\n\nThis list consists of games like Dead Space, a survival-horror game in which you play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair a ship\u2019s communication system after it mysteriously goes offline. Unfortunately for him, that repair job quickly turns into a battle for survival when he finds the ship is a floating human slaughterhouse.\u00a0\n\nDying Light 2: Stay Human which takes place 15 years after the events of the first game. In it you play as Aiden Caldwell, a member of a group of freelance runners and you\u2019re on a quest to find your sister Mia.\n\nAnd Let\u2019s be honest, there are a lot of Resident Evil games out there and at this point in the series they could have a Steam Deck video all to themselves. So for this list we\u2019re just going to focus on the latest release, Resident Evil Village. The game picks up 3 years after the story of Resident Evil 7 and continues to focus on Ethan Winters. After rescuing his wife Mia from the Baker house\u2013spoilers\u2013and subsequently getting saved by Resident Evil franchise mainstay Chris Redfield\u2013extra spoilers\u2013the couple try to restart their lives in Europe. One thing leads to another and you, aka Ethan, find yourself drowning in another crazy trauma inducing situation.\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 Intro\n0:15 Dead Space\n2:10 Dying Light 2: Stay Human\n3:15 Bioshock\n4:10 The Quarry\n4:59 Alien Isolation\n5:49 Resident Evil Village\n6:44 The Evil Within\n7:33 The Little Nightmares 1 & 2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjAxqbzRnYE", "date_published": "2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bayonetta 3 The Witching Hour Official Trailer", "description": "Fight your way through the streets of Tokyo, the mountains of China, and many other locales!

However now the game has a new patch available that rebalances PvP, lays the groundwork for a wider PvP reshuffle and has added hidden references to new maps. If the back to back use of \u2018player vs player\u2019 didn\u2019t give it away, Patch 1.07 is almost exclusively multiplayer-focused. The biggest change is the addition of separate damage scaling for PvP battles, a change that the game's community has lobbied for since its release. As for the tease of new locations, prolific Souls hacker Lance McDonald claims this patch also adds references to maps that aren't in the game yet on a raw code level. It also adds some code that appears to be related to ray-tracing options that don't exist yet in the options menu, either.\n\nThe Steam Mobile App has gotten a complete aesthetic overhaul and a bunch of new features to boot, including new login options and remote downloads. As in previous releases, the Steam Mobile App enables two-factor authentication on Steam. However, more login options are now available, including scanning a QR code with your phone in the app or sign in confirmation. You can now also customize notifications, enabling you to receive notice whenever a game on your wishlist goes on sale or you get a friend request.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RcKcQnKBC8", "date_published": "2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Review", "description": "Overwatch 2 improves upon the core gameplay and characters fans love, but loses some of its predecessor's spirit in the process.\n\n#overwatch2 #gamespot #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqQF7f7YE5c", "date_published": "2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers | Official 4K Combat & Upgrades Overview", "description": "Check out the brand-new combat and upgrade systems in Sonic Frontiers - available for pre-order today!\n\nIn Sonic Frontiers, you'll need every tool at your disposal to defeat the powerful enemies that await you on the Starfall islands.

R. Giger and Zdizislaw Beksinski. The game releases soon, so - here is Everything You Need to Know About Scorn.\n#scorn #scorngame #gamespot \n\nScorn is focused on environmental storytelling with a slower, more methodical gameplay approach. According to the team, there are no cut-scenes, and every bit of storytelling happens in-game. \n\nThe area you\u2019ll be traveling is a techno-organic hellscape, where the technology of the world fuses with organic masses, including your own. It\u2019s structured like a dungeon, and intended to be maze-like. From what we\u2019ve seen so far, much of your time running through this labyrinth will be spent avoiding enemies, while finding organic parts of the world in order to help you progress.\n\nScorn will be released this Friday, October 14, 2022. Scorn releases for PC on platforms like Steam, Epic, and GOG, and will also be available for XBox Series X/S and Game Pass. So, if you have Game Pass, this might be the perfect way to spend Halloween.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOo3rrSEy2Q", "date_published": "2022-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
