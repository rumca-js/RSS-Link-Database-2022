Check out the Second Age Gondorian Shield: bit.ly/NOTR1022

Product Description: The Great War shield carried by the soldiers of the White City of Gondor in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men! A replica of the actual filming prop used in the prologue of The Fellowship of the Ring.

While this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)
