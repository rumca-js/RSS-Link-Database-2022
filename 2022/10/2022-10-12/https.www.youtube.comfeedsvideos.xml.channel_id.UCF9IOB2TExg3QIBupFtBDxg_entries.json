Small\nPfizer\u2019s president of international developed markets\nTestifying before the European Union Parliament, Monday 10th October\nDutch MEP Rob Roos\n\u2018Was the Pfizer Covid vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?\nIf not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee? And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nMs Small \n\u201cRegarding the question around, um, did we know about stopping the immunisation before it entered the market? No\nTherefore\nPfizer Covid vaccine was not tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market\n\nMs Small \nyou know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market, \nand from that point of view we had to do everything at risk. \nI think Dr Bourla, even though he\u2019s not here, would turn around and say to you himself, \u2018If not us then who?\u2019\u201d\nMs Small said Dr Bourla \u201cactually felt the importance of what was going on in the world, \nand therefore as a result of that, we actually, um, spent $US2 billion, at risk, of self-funded money from Pfizer, \nto be able to research, develop and manufacture at risk, to be able to make sure that we were in a position to be able to help with the pandemic\u201d.\nMr Roos\nscandalous\n\u201cMillions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that \u2018you do it for others\u2019\n\u201cNow this turned out to be a cheap lie.
