LYRICS
I feel it rousing me
The messy melody
Of a kid, I used to know

Major yells, minor bells
Seconds lie, and thirds dispel
In an uncharted key

Hold your peace
Don't speak to me, don't speak to me
I won't know yet
No guarantees, no guarantees

The claw resets, be at ease
The creature can't retrieve

Made to piss you off
Ineffectual
Superfluous junk
Appendage, Appendage

I can't bet on everything, on everything
Please don't make me swear, on anything, on anything
I cannot bet on everything, on everything
Please don't make me swear, on anything on anything
