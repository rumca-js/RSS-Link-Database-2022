Thanks to Epic Games for sponsoring - PC Building Simulator 2 is out now on Epic Games Store: https://store.epicgames.com/p/pc-building-simulator-2

Linus vs Dennis wasn't exactly fair, so this time Jake is going to see if he can do a better job than Linus when it comes to virtually building computers in the new and improved PC Building Simulator 2.
