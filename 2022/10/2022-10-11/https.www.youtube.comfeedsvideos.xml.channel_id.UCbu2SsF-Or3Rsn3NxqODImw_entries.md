#GamingNews #PS5 #GTA 

A week and a half into the month and Sony has finally announced October's PlayStation Plus game catalog lineup. Better late than never I guess. 

This month PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members can expect a number of noteworthy games, from lengthy RPGs like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, to tighter experiences like the beloved Inside. And if spooky vibes are what you’re after then the addition of The Medium may speak to you. One of the most notable additions to the catalog is GTA Vice City Definitive Edition, a game that launched alongside remasters of its violent siblings GTA 3 and San Andreas, but also with tons of bugs and glitches that hampered fans enjoyment.

There are also a number of other Assassin's Creed games available, including the China, India, and Russia entries in the Chronicles series.

A variety of PlayStation Classics are available in October as well (for Premium members), including Yakuza 3-5 Remastered, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and Limbo, among others.

All of the games will be available to download from the PlayStation Store starting October 18.

Scorn is an upcoming first person survival horror game by Ebb Software that takes visual inspiration from the likes of H. R. Giger and Zdizislaw Beksinski. The game releases soon, so - here is Everything You Need to Know About Scorn.
#scorn #scorngame #gamespot 

Scorn is focused on environmental storytelling with a slower, more methodical gameplay approach. According to the team, there are no cut-scenes, and every bit of storytelling happens in-game. 

The area you’ll be traveling is a techno-organic hellscape, where the technology of the world fuses with organic masses, including your own. It’s structured like a dungeon, and intended to be maze-like. From what we’ve seen so far, much of your time running through this labyrinth will be spent avoiding enemies, while finding organic parts of the world in order to help you progress.

Scorn will be released this Friday, October 14, 2022. Scorn releases for PC on platforms like Steam, Epic, and GOG, and will also be available for XBox Series X/S and Game Pass. So, if you have Game Pass, this might be the perfect way to spend Halloween.

Overwatch 2’s problems continue and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will require a phone number to play. 
#GamingNews #Overwatch2 #ModernWarfare2 

Overwatch 2's launch continues to be a bumpy one, and this time--Blizzard has taken Bastion and Torbjorn offline in order to fix bugs in their kits. Bastion will completely be unavailable in any modes, but players can still select Torbjorn in Quick Play. Blizzard didn't state which exact character bugs it's fixing, but reports of Bastion being able to infinitely shoot during his ult upon certain conditions have been going around. Torbjorn's bug appears to be a lengthened duration of his Overload ability. Beyond those two heroes who are intentionally temporarily gone, players also reported that they can't access other heroes on their roster. Blizzard confirmed the bug and said it is looking into the issue.

Overwatch 2 went down for emergency maintenance late in the evening on October 10. But right after the maintenance ended, Blizzard reported another DDOS attack. It seems the company just can't catch a break during Overwatch 2's long-awaited launch.
