And if spooky vibes are what you\u2019re after then the addition of The Medium may speak to you.

R. Giger and Zdizislaw Beksinski. The game releases soon, so - here is Everything You Need to Know About Scorn.\n#scorn #scorngame #gamespot \n\nScorn is focused on environmental storytelling with a slower, more methodical gameplay approach. According to the team, there are no cut-scenes, and every bit of storytelling happens in-game. \n\nThe area you\u2019ll be traveling is a techno-organic hellscape, where the technology of the world fuses with organic masses, including your own. It\u2019s structured like a dungeon, and intended to be maze-like. From what we\u2019ve seen so far, much of your time running through this labyrinth will be spent avoiding enemies, while finding organic parts of the world in order to help you progress.\n\nScorn will be released this Friday, October 14, 2022. Scorn releases for PC on platforms like Steam, Epic, and GOG, and will also be available for XBox Series X/S and Game Pass. So, if you have Game Pass, this might be the perfect way to spend Halloween.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOo3rrSEy2Q", "date_published": "2022-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Among Us VR | Official Release Date Trailer", "description": "Get ready for emergency meetings, Crewmates!

Bastion will completely be unavailable in any modes, but players can still select Torbjorn in Quick Play. Blizzard didn't state which exact character bugs it's fixing, but reports of Bastion being able to infinitely shoot during his ult upon certain conditions have been going around. Torbjorn's bug appears to be a lengthened duration of his Overload ability. Beyond those two heroes who are intentionally temporarily gone, players also reported that they can't access other heroes on their roster. Blizzard confirmed the bug and said it is looking into the issue.\n\nOverwatch 2 went down for emergency maintenance late in the evening on October 10. But right after the maintenance ended, Blizzard reported another DDOS attack. It seems the company just can't catch a break during Overwatch 2's long-awaited launch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeP2rN7j3rI", "date_published": "2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
