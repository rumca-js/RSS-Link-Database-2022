Instead, you'll have to long press the green button in the window controls, and select a screen half. \n\nOther window management issues include the inability to click a minimized window in the dock to restore it, or the lack of thumbnails of windows in the actual alt tab switcher.\n\nMacOS will introduce stage manager in its newer version, Ventura, as an optional feature, and it does look interesting.\n\nSecond aspect where Linux is better than macOS is software installation.\n\nFirst, while experienced users will have no trouble understanding that you need to download a DMG image, then open it, then drag the app bundle into your Applications folder, i've seen a LOT of new mac users never picking up on that.\n\nThe app store, while it looks nice, is just not fully stocked. Due to Apple's guidelines and limitations, a lot of apps can't be distributed through it.\n\nAnd the security certificates will annoy you with popups not letting you run applications unless you voluntarily go into the settings to disable that feature either one time, or always.\n\nAnd linux might have multiple packaging formats, but they all end up inside a graphical app store where you can see who they're from, and download them easily in one click, and if you still prefer the macOS model of single file apps, you have Appimages.\n\nNext point is hardware choices. Sure, these new macs are probably the best value in terms of design, performance, and battery life for laptops. But if their lineup doesn't have what you're looking for, or if you don't have 1000 dollars and more to spend, you're out of Luck.\n\nLinux hardware support might not be 100% perfect, with some wifi and bluetooth cards not fully supported, or power management not being perfect on some devices, but generally, it will run on any device.\n\nNext point is security and privacy. macOS has more market share than Linux desktops, and as such, is more exposed to threats, and targeted more often.\n\nLinux servers are targeted a lot, but generally through vulnerabilities that affect server related libraries, which you won't have on your desktop or laptop. \n\nLinux is a smaller target, and it's also more of a moving target, with distros using wildly different systems and libraries, which means your trojan, ransomware, or virus, won't affect every distro, when writing something for a version of macOS will definitely hurt all users of that version.\n\nAnd another point is customization. macOS is to be taken as-is. You can change an accent color, the position of the dock, and a few third party utilities might let you tweak some minor elements but that's it. \n\nLinux, on the other hand, is completely open to this. You can pick any underlying system and change it, you can change the layout of your desktop, the colors, the theme, the workflow, the window manager, the apps, the packaging system, anything you want.\n\nWhether that's through the use of a specific distro, or through your own ricing skills, your Linux desktop can be exactly how you like it, where a mac will only suit you if you like how macOS works.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjW-kMivWQ", "date_published": "2022-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
