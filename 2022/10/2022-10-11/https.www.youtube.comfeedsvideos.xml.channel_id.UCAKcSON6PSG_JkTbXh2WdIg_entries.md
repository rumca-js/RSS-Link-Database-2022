## Manchester Orchestra – session at the MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair (music + interview)

Manchester Orchestra are neither from Manchester nor an orchestra, but as an Atlanta-based rock band, they do just fine for themselves, thank you very much. In late August, Manchester Orchestra visited the Upper Midwest, where they performed as part of The Current’s Music on-a-Stick show at the Minnesota State Fair Grandstand. The show was notoriously cut short due to a sudden burst of severe weather, but not before Manchester Orchestra got in a good chunk of their set. 

Earlier in the day, Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull and Robert McDowell visited the MPR booth — aka Camp MPR — near the corner of Judson and Nelson, where they played acoustic versions of a couple of their songs and chatted with host Bill DeVille. 

Watch and listen to the complete session above.
