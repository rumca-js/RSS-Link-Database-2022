I've no idea how I missed it before. But for the third video in the Monorail Trilogy, this isn't an advert: I'm just happy to be proved wrong. \u25aa More about the Monorack: https://www.doppelmayr.com/products/monorack/\n\nPreviously, Wuppertal in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4KZLcvMQWg (I'm not proud of this video -- the Tim Traveller has done a much better video on the system here, and you should probably watch that instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFh6wFTJiQ )\n\nAnd the Roadmachines monorail in 2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irv3KJR6B80\n\n(Thanks also to Grotto de Peo in Ronco sopra Ascona.
