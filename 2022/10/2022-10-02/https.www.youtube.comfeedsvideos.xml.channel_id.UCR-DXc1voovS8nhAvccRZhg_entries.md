It's easier to spot the Loch Ness Monster than to get your hands on a Raspberry Pi right now. Is the situation getting any better? Are there any other options?

In today's livestream I'll discuss what's going on, with some updates from Eben Upton himself, and talk about (and test!) some alternative boards, like the new CB1 from BigTreeTech. And we'll discuss why some people might consider another SBC.
