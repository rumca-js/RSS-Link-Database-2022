When we reviewed the original AirPods Pro back in 2019, we found the feature set good but the sound a bit lacking. After 3 years, Apple has finally released a successor. Is it better than the first generation AirPods Pro? Is it worth upgrading? How does it compare to the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro and the Bose Quiet Comfort In-Ear II? All of this and more in the Snazzy Labs review of AirPods Pro 2.
