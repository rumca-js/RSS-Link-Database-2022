Sea Hero Quest, in both its mobile and VR forms, tasks you with sailing a small boat, memorizing maps and navigating colorful seascapes. But under the surface, it hopes to provide the data that could help humanity fight an incurable disease that affects hundreds of millions of people.

We spoke to Hugo Spiers, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, and developer Max Scott-Slade of indie developer Glitchers, to find out how Sea Hero Quest revolutionised dementia research around the world, and the breakthroughs the game has led to since release.

Spooky season is officially here! And there is nothing spookier than being haunted by the September games you didn’t finish yet. Here are 10 of the biggest games releasing in October 2022. 
#ModernWarfare2 #Overwatch2 #Gamespot

Modern Warfare 2 follows three years after the events of MW 2019, with Captain Price's Task Force 141 now fully formed and operating around the world. Price is joined by the iconic characters of Simon "Ghost" Riley, Kyle "Gaz" Garrick, and John "Soap" MacTavish, but this newly assembled Task Force 141 also includes a new character known as Alejandro Vargas.

Overwatch 2 is the sequel to 2016’s Overwatch and will include some new takes on the combat we saw in the original game. That includes a brand-new game mode called Push, in which two teams fight to escort a robot into enemy territory, as well as the game’s switch to 5v5 matches instead of the original game’s 6v6 model. Team composition is also being adjusted so that teams only contain one tank character so plan accordingly when assembling your friends to play.  

While its predecessor saw Mario and company in familiar territory as the Rabbids were transported to the Mushroom Kingdom, that won't be the case in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The adventure will take our heroes across multiple planets as they work together to stop an "evil influence”. Sparks of Hope combines free-roaming exploration with turn-based combat. While wandering each planet, you're free to move as you wish in order to solve puzzles and uncover secrets and collectibles. Once you make contact with an enemy, however, the game switches to a turn-based strategy system.

## FIFA 23 Review

FIFA 23 makes incremental improvements to last year's game, but the looming presence of Ultimate Team's microtransactions cast a shadow over everything.
#FIFA23 #gamespot #EASports 

FIFA 23 marks the end of an era for the long-running series. After an almost 30-year partnership that began with players like David Platt gracing the cover, EA Sports has parted ways with football's governing body over a licensing disagreement. Future games in the series will now drop the FIFA name in favor of a new EA Sports FC moniker. Not that you'd be able to tell from playing FIFA 23, mind you. Despite being the last game adorned with the household name, it's business as usual both on and off the pitch for EA's latest footballing sim. There are a few new additions spread across its various game modes--and Ultimate Team sees its most significant change in years--but for the most part, FIFA's swansong is a game of minor iterations.
