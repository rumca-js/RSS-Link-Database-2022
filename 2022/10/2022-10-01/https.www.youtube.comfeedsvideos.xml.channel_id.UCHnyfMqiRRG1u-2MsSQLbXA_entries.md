The raindrop video is from Alistair McClymont’s gorgeous artwork “Raindrop” – ​​https://alistairmcclymont.com/artwork/raindrop/

Video of the raindrop breaking apart is from the coolest paper i’ve read in a while –  Villermaux, E., & Bossa, B. (2009). Single-drop fragmentation determines size distribution of raindrops. Nature physics, 5(9), 697-702. – https://ve42.co/Villermaux
