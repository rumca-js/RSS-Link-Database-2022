This week on Breakout we're taking about remakes following the announcements of the Silent Hill 2, The Witcher and more being remade. We'll also provide some recommendations on spooky games to play for Halloween.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
