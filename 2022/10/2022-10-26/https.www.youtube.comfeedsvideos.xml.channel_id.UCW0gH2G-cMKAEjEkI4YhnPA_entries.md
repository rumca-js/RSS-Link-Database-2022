Kicking off our weekly livestreams to chat about anything and everything Tolkien related!  One big topic will be the recent article where a broker for the Embracer rights deal said Middle-earth could be an IP to rival Marvel & Star Wars: https://deadline.com/2022/10/lord-of-the-rings-got-talent-embracer-group-acf-mipcom-cannes-1235149178/

We also chat about the rumored LEGO Lord of the Rings sets - and what we are hoping for in such a set.
