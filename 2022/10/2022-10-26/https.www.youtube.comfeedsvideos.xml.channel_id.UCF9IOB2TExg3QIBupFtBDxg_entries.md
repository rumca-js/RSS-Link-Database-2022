Lower than previously thought

Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand (16th March 2020)

Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team 

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf

We assumed

Incubation period of 5.1 days

Infectious 12 hours before to 4.6 days after

R0=2.4 

Non-uniform attack, applied to the GB population

Result in an IFR of 0.9% 

with 4.4% of infections hospitalised

10.4 day stay

30% of hospitalised, ICU (50% death rate)

(not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality)

Age-stratified infection fatality rate of COVID-19 in the non-elderly informed from pre-vaccination national seroprevalence studies

Stanford California, Rome, Montreal

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.11.22280963v1

40 eligible national seroprevalence studies,

covering 38 countries with pre-vaccination seroprevalence data. 

For 29 countries publicly available age-stratified COVID-19 death data,

and age-stratified seroprevalence information were available,

and were included in the primary analysis. 

IFRs for 0 to 59 years

median IFR = 0.035%

(IQR, 0.013 - 0.056%)

Without accounting for seroreversion

(average time from seroconversion to seroreversion at 3-4 months)

IFRs for 0 to 69 years

IFR = 0.095% 

0 to 19 years

IFR = 0.0003%

20 to 29 years

IFR = 0.003%

30 to 39 years

IFR = 0.011%

40-49 years

IFR = 0.035% 

50-59 years

IFR = 0.129%

60-69 years

IFR = 0.501%

At a global level

Pre-vaccination IFR,

may have been as low as,

0 to 59 years = 0.03%

0 to 69 years = 0.07%

Global population

94% younger than 70 years

91% younger than 65 years

86% younger than 60 years

The current analysis suggests a much lower pre-vaccination IFR in non-elderly populations than previously suggested. 

Large differences did exist between countries and may reflect differences in comorbidities and other factors. 

These estimates provide a baseline from which to fathom further IFR declines with the widespread use of,

Vaccination 

Prior infections

Evolution of new variants.

Unmitigated epidemic
(March 2020)
UK deaths = 510,000 (168,913)

US deaths =  2.2 million (1,065,152)

During 2021 and 2022

Vaccination, new variants, prior infections,

resulted in a marked decline in the IFR

10 vaccine doses for every EU citizen

It (EU) took measures to help compress the development timeline for vaccines from 10-15 years to 12-24 months. 

November 2021

Commission had signed €71 billion worth of contracts

to purchase up to 4.6 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses. 

EU population 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/253372/total-population-of-the-european-union-eu/

2021, 447.01 million 

(more than 10 vaccines each)

Contracts never released to the public

The EU had to act ahead of clear scientific data on vaccine candidates’ safety and efficacy, 

and therefore chose to back a range of candidates 

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dominates the portfolio in 2022-2023 because of, according to the Commission, the company’s ability to reliably supply the EU.
