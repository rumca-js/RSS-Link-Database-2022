The studio said via its Japanese Twitter account that the localized version for Japan will be discontinued and that anyone who preordered will get a refund.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol takes place in a prison on one of Jupiter's moons, Callisto. The game promises to be extremely violent and gory. In fact, Striking Dance boss Glen Schofield said the development team looked at grisly car crash scenes for inspiration.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol launches on December 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game could spawn a sequel, as Schofield has said he has ideas for additional entries in the series.\n\nIn less scary news, Gotham Knights developer Warner Bros. Montreal has released a new update for the game that aims to improve performance issues on PC, with a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch coming soon. This is a small patch, but a more substantial update will follow it as the studio looks to add a \"mix of needed fixes that have popped up since launch\" for the game, specifically frame rate stability on consoles.\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - The Callisto Protocol\n01:20 - Gotham Knights\n02:06 - Modern Warfare 2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfJpxlsh_ks", "date_published": "2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bayonetta 3 Review", "description": "Bayonetta 3 is a show-stopping spectacle that feels familiar in all the right ways while also adding mechanics that are sure to delight old and new fans alike.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T3ysyqNBU", "date_published": "2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2: Realism Mode, No Death Pistols Only", "description": "We head to the US/Mexico border in 4k on Realism difficulty, no deaths and only our pistol to hunt down Hassan Zayani and stop a terrorist threat in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. \n\nThe multiplayer releases on October 28, 2022 so check out Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One and PC.\n\n#callofduty #cod #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7oT9bp-8yc", "date_published": "2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2\u2019s Multiplayer Launch Details | GameSpot News", "description": "Today we\u2019re talking about what you can expect from Modern Warfare 2\u2019s multiplayer at launch as well as a new Last of Us multiplayer update\n\nCurrently, players who pre-order Modern Warfare II can get early access to the game's single-player campaign. Multiplayer will arrive for all players on October 28, though those wanting to experience Warzone 2.0 will have to wait a bit longer, as the free-to-play battle royale isn't arriving until November 16.\n\nModes in Modern Warfare II are broken down into two categories: Core Map modes and Battle Map modes. Core Map modes are smaller, 6v6 combat zones players familiar with the series are no doubt accustomed to. Battle Map modes, however, are built for 32v32 game types and include vehicles.\n\nAnd sticking with the multiplayer news, a recent job listing at Naughty Dog might be pointing towards the untitled The Last of Us multiplayer title being free-to-play.\n\nAs spotted by Reddit user JadedDarkness, shared to the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, a live ops producer role posted by Naughty Dog seems to suggest that the studio's multiplayer The Last of Us game might be free-to-play. In the bonus skills section, one of the points listed reads, \"Proven experience in a production role supporting a AAA, free to play, live title.\"\n\nNaughty Dog hasn't announced a free-to-play title, but last year the studio was looking for an economy designer for a multiplayer game with live service elements, which was prior to the official reveal that The Last of Us multiplayer would be a standalone title. Considering Sony has plans to launch 12 live service games by 2025, a free-to-play, multiplayer The Last of Us would fit quite nicely in there.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMMOO0-E9xs", "date_published": "2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Callisto Protocol Isn't Just Another Dead Space", "description": "GameSpot had the opportunity to check out Striking Distance's survival horror game, The Callisto Protocol.
