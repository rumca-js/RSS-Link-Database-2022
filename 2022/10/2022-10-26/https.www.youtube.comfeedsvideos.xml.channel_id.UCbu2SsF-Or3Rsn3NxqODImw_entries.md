The Callisto Protocol gets canceled in Japan, Gotham Knights is getting lots of fixes and Modern Warfare 2 isn’t what you think it is.
#GamingNews #TheCallistoProtocol #PS5

The Callisto Protocol will not be released in Japan due to the game failing to receive a rating there, presumably due to its violence and gore. The studio said via its Japanese Twitter account that the localized version for Japan will be discontinued and that anyone who preordered will get a refund.

The Callisto Protocol takes place in a prison on one of Jupiter's moons, Callisto. The game promises to be extremely violent and gory. In fact, Striking Dance boss Glen Schofield said the development team looked at grisly car crash scenes for inspiration.

The Callisto Protocol launches on December 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game could spawn a sequel, as Schofield has said he has ideas for additional entries in the series.

In less scary news, Gotham Knights developer Warner Bros. Montreal has released a new update for the game that aims to improve performance issues on PC, with a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch coming soon. This is a small patch, but a more substantial update will follow it as the studio looks to add a "mix of needed fixes that have popped up since launch" for the game, specifically frame rate stability on consoles.

## Modern Warfare 2’s Multiplayer Launch Details | GameSpot News

Today we’re talking about what you can expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer at launch as well as a new Last of Us multiplayer update

Currently, players who pre-order Modern Warfare II can get early access to the game's single-player campaign. Multiplayer will arrive for all players on October 28, though those wanting to experience Warzone 2.0 will have to wait a bit longer, as the free-to-play battle royale isn't arriving until November 16.

Modes in Modern Warfare II are broken down into two categories: Core Map modes and Battle Map modes. Core Map modes are smaller, 6v6 combat zones players familiar with the series are no doubt accustomed to. Battle Map modes, however, are built for 32v32 game types and include vehicles.

And sticking with the multiplayer news, a recent job listing at Naughty Dog might be pointing towards the untitled The Last of Us multiplayer title being free-to-play.

As spotted by Reddit user JadedDarkness, shared to the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, a live ops producer role posted by Naughty Dog seems to suggest that the studio's multiplayer The Last of Us game might be free-to-play. In the bonus skills section, one of the points listed reads, "Proven experience in a production role supporting a AAA, free to play, live title."

Naughty Dog hasn't announced a free-to-play title, but last year the studio was looking for an economy designer for a multiplayer game with live service elements, which was prior to the official reveal that The Last of Us multiplayer would be a standalone title. Considering Sony has plans to launch 12 live service games by 2025, a free-to-play, multiplayer The Last of Us would fit quite nicely in there.

GameSpot had the opportunity to check out Striking Distance's survival horror game, The Callisto Protocol. Jordan played for around 90 minutes, and it didn't end up being as scary as he expected.
