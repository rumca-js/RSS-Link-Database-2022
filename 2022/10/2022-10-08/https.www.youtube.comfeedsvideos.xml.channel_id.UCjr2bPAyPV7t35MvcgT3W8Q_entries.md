Social media is flooded with CIA propaganda disseminated by former spies. Their lies are dangerous and need to be dealt with.

CIA now has a large social media presence with multi-million-follower accounts on Twitter, Instagram and Twitter. The agency is using social media as a recruitment tool but another mission of their social media arm is to make the public view the CIA in a positive light. Anytime you are suggested content with a “CIA spy reacts” or an “interview with a former/current CIA operative” you are being enrolled into re-education class.

This is dangerous. But how do I prove it to you? How do you know when a spy is telling you a lie passed down from the highest ranks in the government? Manipulation only works if you don’t know the whole truth. So allow me to show you the other side of the story.
