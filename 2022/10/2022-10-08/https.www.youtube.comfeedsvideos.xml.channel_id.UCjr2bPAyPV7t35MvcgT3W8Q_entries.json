Their lies are dangerous and need to be dealt with.\nSupport independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nCIA now has a large social media presence with multi-million-follower accounts on Twitter, Instagram and Twitter. The agency is using social media as a recruitment tool but another mission of their social media arm is to make the public view the CIA in a positive light. Anytime you are suggested content with a \u201cCIA spy reacts\u201d or an \u201cinterview with a former/current CIA operative\u201d you are being enrolled into re-education class.\n\nThis is dangerous. But how do I prove it to you? How do you know when a spy is telling you a lie passed down from the highest ranks in the government? Manipulation only works if you don\u2019t know the whole truth. So allow me to show you the other side of the story. \n\nSources\n    0. https://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda \n    1. https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/08/cia-least-covert-mission-510043\n    2. https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/25/cia-recruitment-joined-social-media-age/\n    3. https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/wikileaks-password-is-an-anticia-jfk-quote/news-story/d6c1cc5385c4f1330bb87f1be2ecefa3 \n    4. https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-race-and-ethnicity-intelligence-agencies-demographics-e22ea4d22d4564608d7972be95e570b9\n    5. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/cia-makes-social-media-splash-with-i-spy-challenge-on-instagram\n    6. https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/02/media/youtube-state-funded-media-label/index.html\n    7. https://www.propublica.org/article/youtube-promised-to-label-state-sponsored-videos-but-doesnt-always-do-so\n    8. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\n    9. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/obama-administration-nsa-verizon-records \n    10. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/nsa-surveillance-doesnt-stop-terrorism-report-claims\n    11. http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Bergen_NAF_NSA%20Surveillance_1.pdf \n    12. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nsa-program-stopped-no-terror-attacks-says-white-house-panel-flna2D11783588\n    13. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk\n    14. https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/01/mlk-fbi-surveillance/617719/ \n    15. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology\n    16. https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/29/21274828/drone-minneapolis-protests-predator-surveillance-police\n    17. https://www.fastcompany.com/90511912/the-long-ugly-history-of-how-police-have-tracked-protesters \n    18. https://source.android.com/devices/architecture\n    19. https://source.android.com/security/overview\n    20. https://developer.android.com/guide/platform/\n    21. https://source.android.com/security/features\n    22. https://source.android.com/security/selinux/concepts\n    23. https://source.android.com/security/selinux/\n    24. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05572.pdf  \n    25. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805\n    26. https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/warrantless-surveillance-under-section-702-fisa\n    27. https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/fbi-and-nsa-violated-surveillance-law-or-privacy-rules-a-federal-judge-found/2020/09/04/b215cf88-eec3-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html\n    28. https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/fbi-nsa-mass-surveillance-abuse/\n    29. https://eji.org/news/united-states-still-has-highest-incarceration-rate-world/\n    30. https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/\n    31. https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/intl-rates.png\n    32. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNAXLX6pKg", "date_published": "2022-10-08 22:51:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
