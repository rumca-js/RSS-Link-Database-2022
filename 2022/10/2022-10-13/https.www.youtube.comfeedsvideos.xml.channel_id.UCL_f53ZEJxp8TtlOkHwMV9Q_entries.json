Peterson and Andrew Huberman discuss neurology, the way humans and animals react to specific stimuli, and how this knowledge can be utilized for personal growth.\n \nDr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist, and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He runs the Huberman Lab, which has made significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity. Dr. Huberman\u2019s most recent work revolves around the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. In 2017, he was chosen to receive the Cogan award, which is awarded to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. Work from the Huberman Laboratory has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets. In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab Podcast, and has since grown to over 1.5 million subscribers.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Andrew Huberman\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/?hl=en \n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/hubermanlab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\nWebsite https://hubermanlab.com/\n\nYoutube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg \n\n\u2014Sponsors\u2014 \n\nText \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(0:57) Intro \n(3:18) Where anxiety stems from\n(11:57) Flipping the autonomic response\n(23:10) Power of the prefrontal cortex\n(30:00) Accessing our alternate selves\n(36:25) When you stimulate the Insular cortex\n(42:08) The one true world currency\n(46:38) Dopamine\u2019s pleasure derives from anticipation\n(50:10) Depressive cascades\n(54:12) Assess errors by state, not trait\n(1:01:45) Dopamine chases outer stimuli\n(1:04:13) Can new stimuli rewrite our neural pathways?\n(1:09:27) Manifesting and the dopamine cycle\n(1:15:59) Adrenaline, micro-narratives\n(1:20:33) Sustained attention and reward\n(1:27:03) Zone of proximal development\n(1:32:23) Resisting the easy dopamine hit, avoiding addiction\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #drjordanbpeterson  #DailyWirePlus #podcast #andrewhuberman #neurology #psychology #mentalhealth #neuroscience", "persistent": false}], "source url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "source title": "Jordan B Peterson"}
