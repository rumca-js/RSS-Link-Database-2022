After a decade of movies, the Harry Potter film series came to an end in 2011 with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. The whole series was a massive worldwide phenomenon and the final movie alone grossed over 1.3 billion at the box office!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 definitely raises some questions though. Like why is Harry getting strategic visions of Voldemort and not the other way around? Why doesn’t Voldemort send his super important snake away from the massive battle taking place? Why didn’t any of the really helpful magical things introduced in previous movies come into play? Why did Harry name his kid Albus Severus?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2!
