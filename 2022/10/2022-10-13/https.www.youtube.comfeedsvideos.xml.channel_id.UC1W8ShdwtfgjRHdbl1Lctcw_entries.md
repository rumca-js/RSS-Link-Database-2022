I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Kansas City and Michigan 1920s, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, Chelsea, Michigan, street panorama outside Kansas City's Union Station, , The Council Grove, tecumseh

✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
