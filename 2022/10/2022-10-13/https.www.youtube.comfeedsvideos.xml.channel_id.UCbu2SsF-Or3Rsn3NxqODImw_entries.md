Activision clears up the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 phone number requirement and Gotham Knights confirms a 4-Player mode.
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2  

Activision has clarified the SMS requirement for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, confirming that a phone number is required for PC players but not on console. This confirmation comes not long after another Activision Blizzard game, Overwatch 2, made headlines for its own controversial SMS policy.

In a blog post, Activision said a "text-enabled mobile phone number" is required for Modern Warfare 2 on PC. This is the same requirement that has been in place for Warzone players on PC since May 2020. Anyone who previously played Warzone on PC won't have to do anything else to get started with Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0. Additionally, people on Steam must link a phone number to play Modern Warfare II, so this requirement is not limited to Battle.net alone.

Activision also provided an update on the efforts it's taking to fight cheating in Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0. Activision's Ricochet anti-cheat system will be available at launch for Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0, and it will be beefed up with "better detection capabilities, additional access to develop and deploy new mitigation techniques, and expanded freedom to update our security more frequently than ever before."

And lastly, let's talk about Gotham Knights. The upcoming brawler set in the Batman universe will get a proper four-player co-op mode in late November, a little over a month after the game's October 21 release. Called Heroic Assault, the mode will be added to Gotham Knights as a free update on November 29 and is entirely separate from the main story campaign.

Scorn, a game with notable visual influences from H.R. Giger and Zdzisław Beksiński is finally out after around 8 years of since its first kickstarter. But, was this creepy bio-horror filled world worth the wait?
#scorn #scorngame #gamespot

Scorn is primarily an exploration puzzle game, with most of its gameplay revolving around searching the game's grotesque environment for clues, all while witnessing a number of horrors and disgusting visuals. Your nameless character is on a quest with no forward-facing explanation, so it's up to you to interpret the meaning of your quest and the world around you.

While Scorn mostly focuses on exploration and puzzle solving, with the environments themselves often times lending themselves to the puzzles, there are also FPS elements, with your character finding multiple weapons they can use to hold enemies at bay. Of course, like most horror games, ammo is limited, and the enemies are overpowered, meaning you'll want to avoid these encounters at all costs.

What is there to discover in Scorn, and how is the game? Check out Alessandro Barbosa's review here to see if it's worth your time to take a trip into the world of Scorn.

We’re going to go over some of the best horror games to play right now on your Steam Deck. Here are the conditions: the game has to run well on Deck and it has to be a good fit for the handheld/on-the-go experience.
#Gaming #SteamDeck #PCGaming

Spooky season is in full swing and what better way to celebrate than to play some scary games. It's also a great time to visit pumpkin patches or haunted houses, so while you travel, why not take those games with you. The Steam Deck is the perfect way to play all those scream inducing experiences while on-the-go. 

This list consists of games like Dead Space, a survival-horror game in which you play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair a ship’s communication system after it mysteriously goes offline. Unfortunately for him, that repair job quickly turns into a battle for survival when he finds the ship is a floating human slaughterhouse. 

Dying Light 2: Stay Human which takes place 15 years after the events of the first game. In it you play as Aiden Caldwell, a member of a group of freelance runners and you’re on a quest to find your sister Mia.

And Let’s be honest, there are a lot of Resident Evil games out there and at this point in the series they could have a Steam Deck video all to themselves. So for this list we’re just going to focus on the latest release, Resident Evil Village. The game picks up 3 years after the story of Resident Evil 7 and continues to focus on Ethan Winters. After rescuing his wife Mia from the Baker house–spoilers–and subsequently getting saved by Resident Evil franchise mainstay Chris Redfield–extra spoilers–the couple try to restart their lives in Europe. One thing leads to another and you, aka Ethan, find yourself drowning in another crazy trauma inducing situation.

Elden Ring may be getting new locations and ray tracing according to a new report, Plus, Steam’s mobile app gets a major update.
#GamingNews #EldenRing #Steam 

Elden Ring was the loudest game in early 2022, but in the past couple of months From Software have been fairly quiet. However now the game has a new patch available that rebalances PvP, lays the groundwork for a wider PvP reshuffle and has added hidden references to new maps. If the back to back use of ‘player vs player’ didn’t give it away, Patch 1.07 is almost exclusively multiplayer-focused. The biggest change is the addition of separate damage scaling for PvP battles, a change that the game's community has lobbied for since its release. As for the tease of new locations, prolific Souls hacker Lance McDonald claims this patch also adds references to maps that aren't in the game yet on a raw code level. It also adds some code that appears to be related to ray-tracing options that don't exist yet in the options menu, either.

The Steam Mobile App has gotten a complete aesthetic overhaul and a bunch of new features to boot, including new login options and remote downloads. As in previous releases, the Steam Mobile App enables two-factor authentication on Steam. However, more login options are now available, including scanning a QR code with your phone in the app or sign in confirmation. You can now also customize notifications, enabling you to receive notice whenever a game on your wishlist goes on sale or you get a friend request.
