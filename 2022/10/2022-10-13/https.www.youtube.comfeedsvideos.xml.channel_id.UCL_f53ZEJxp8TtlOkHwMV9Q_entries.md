Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Huberman discuss neurology, the way humans and animals react to specific stimuli, and how this knowledge can be utilized for personal growth.
 
Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist, and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He runs the Huberman Lab, which has made significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity. Dr. Huberman’s most recent work revolves around the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. In 2017, he was chosen to receive the Cogan award, which is awarded to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. Work from the Huberman Laboratory has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets. In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab Podcast, and has since grown to over 1.5 million subscribers.
