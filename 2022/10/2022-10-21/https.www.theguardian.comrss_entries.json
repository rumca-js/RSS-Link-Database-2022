But when employees are allowed to more fully express themselves in their workspace, it can make a big difference to their wellbeing, and to their work.</p><p>\u201cThe average person will spend a third of their life at work, and if you\u2019re made to leave your personality at the door, that\u2019s going to have a huge impact on your mental health, your identity and your self-confidence,\u201d says Jessica Andrews, founder of branding consultancy <a href=\"http://rabbitandotherstories.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbit &amp; Other Stories</a>. \u201cIn turn, your motivation, your productivity, and your results will suffer; and for a company, that\u2019s not good news.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-driving-another-way/2022/oct/21/personality-splash-five-ways-to-be-more-you-at-work\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business-driving-another-way/2022/oct/21/personality-splash-five-ways-to-be-more-you-at-work", "date_published": "2022-10-21 12:48:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Business on the move: the new breed of company EV", "description": "<p>From virtual showrooms to cutting-edge tech, the all-electric CUPRA Born is showing what the next generation of business travel looks like</p><p>Looking at a new company car online and checking one out in a showroom have, up until now, been two very separate experiences \u2013 neither of which are ideal. Sitting at home in front of your computer screen will allow you to spec a vehicle. You might be able to give it a 360-degree spin if the manufacturer\u2019s website features all the bells and whistles, but you won\u2019t really get much of a feel for your potential new car; and you\u2019ll have to go digging through the rest of the website to find answers to any specific questions you may have. Visiting a showroom, on the other hand, will get you up close and personal to the vehicle, but you have to physically get to the dealership in the first place. <br /><br />In a best-of-both worlds approach, CUPRA is combining the website and showroom experiences into one single process. In the market for a new company car, for example the Born all-electric vehicle? Then visit the new CUPRA <a href=\"https://www.cupraofficial.co.uk/about-cupra/virtual-showroom.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virtual Showroom</a> and you\u2019ll be able to get a live tour of the car online \u2013 through your computer or phone \u2013 with a product expert showing you around the vehicle\u2019s exterior and interior, taking you through its numerous features and answering all the questions you can think of. No waiting around, no wasted time: click the link, set up an appointment and a CUPRA agent will send you a message, connect you to an audio and video session, and you\u2019re ready to go.</p><p>You can direct the agent through the car as you wish, and sessions can be as brief or as detailed as you need, lasting from just a few minutes to an hour. It\u2019s totally up to you. And the experience itself is impressive. Being able to guide the agent around the car, essentially via a video call, allows you to see what you want to see of the vehicle in clear, close-up detail, as well as witnessing the interior tech being put to use in real time. In the modern hybrid working landscape, where Zoom calls are now the norm, the CUPRA Virtual Showroom has successfully plugged itself into the zeitgeist. <br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s pretty innovative,\u201d says Martin Gray, CUPRA\u2019s UK contract hire and leasing manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great reactions from customers so far. It really works for the Born, as the car is so different from others in its class. Because of the way it looks, and because of its technology and the way the dashboard is set up, people really want to get a good look at it. And in a climate where supply of actual physical vehicles has become a real issue, this gives more people the opportunity to see the Born up close and personal.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-driving-another-way/2022/oct/21/business-on-the-move-the-new-breed-of-company-ev\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business-driving-another-way/2022/oct/21/business-on-the-move-the-new-breed-of-company-ev", "date_published": "2022-10-21 12:48:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Best fleet forward: seven things to consider when choosing your next company car", "description": "<p>Choosing a company car is not quite the same as deciding on a vehicle for yourself.
