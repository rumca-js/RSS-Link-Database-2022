Resident Evil producer opens up about a Code Veronica remake, Resident Evil 4 Remake gets a new gameplay trailer and Village gets a third person demo.
#GamingNews #RE #ResidentEvil

During an interview with Noisy Pixel, Resident Evil producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that Capcom currently has no plans to remake Resident Evil: Code Veronica. If you’re new to the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica is a cult classic that was first released as a Dreamcast exclusive, but eventually came to the PlayStation 2 with more cutscenes. The game is set between Resident Evil 2 and 3; games that had remakes released in 2019 and 2020 respectively. So it's only natural to wonder if Capcom plans to redo this middle story as well. 

Luckily for fans, that lack of plans doesn’t seem to be set in stone and Hirabayashi added that the opportunity for a Code Veronica remake hadn't been ruled out entirely. In the meantime, if you find yourself needing to play the game on current-gen hardware, you can check out the 2011 remaster on Xbox Series X|S via backward compatibility. 

While that Resident Evil game won't be getting a remake yet, one of the most beloved entries in the series will be getting a massive overhaul next year. Resident Evil 4 will arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S on March 24, 2023, and a new trailer showed off more of the game's big set piece moments and creepy monsters during Capcom's latest showcase.

There is currently an RE4 Remake hands-on preview on the GameSpot YouTube channel right now in which Kurt Indovina walks you through his time with the game.

This isn't Pokemon Legends: Arceus, but in some ways it's taking even bigger swings with the franchise formula.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are just around the corner and GameSpot's editor Steve Watts got to check it out for over an hour. Here are his thoughts on latest Pokemon adventure.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet take place in the Paldea region. In these games players can challenge gym leaders in any order and tackle the story in any way they see fit. GameFreak has also announced a handful of new monsters for trainers to find and collect.

Scarlet and Violet come to the Nintendo Switch on November 18.
