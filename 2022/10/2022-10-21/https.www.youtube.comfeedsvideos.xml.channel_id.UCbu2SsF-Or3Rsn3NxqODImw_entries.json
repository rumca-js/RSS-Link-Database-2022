If you\u2019re new to the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica is a cult classic that was first released as a Dreamcast exclusive, but eventually came to the PlayStation 2 with more cutscenes. The game is set between Resident Evil 2 and 3; games that had remakes released in 2019 and 2020 respectively. So it's only natural to wonder if Capcom plans to redo this middle story as well. \n\nLuckily for fans, that lack of plans doesn\u2019t seem to be set in stone and Hirabayashi added that the opportunity for a Code Veronica remake hadn't been ruled out entirely. In the meantime, if you find yourself needing to play the game on current-gen hardware, you can check out the 2011 remaster on Xbox Series X|S via backward compatibility. \n\nWhile that Resident Evil game won't be getting a remake yet, one of the most beloved entries in the series will be getting a massive overhaul next year. Resident Evil 4 will arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S on March 24, 2023, and a new trailer showed off more of the game's big set piece moments and creepy monsters during Capcom's latest showcase.\n\nThere is currently an RE4 Remake hands-on preview on the GameSpot YouTube channel right now in which Kurt Indovina walks you through his time with the game.\n\nFull Video: https://youtu.be/6DXTWwxZeA4", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_GEKFX_Jfg", "date_published": "2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet And Violet: Big Changes Explained", "description": "This isn't Pokemon Legends: Arceus, but in some ways it's taking even bigger swings with the franchise formula.\n\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet are just around the corner and GameSpot's editor Steve Watts got to check it out for over an hour.
