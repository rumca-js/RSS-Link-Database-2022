Hello! It's finally here. My Quest Pro Review. Well, this is honestly closer to an impressions video to be honest because other than the physical hardware differences, not much is all that different from something like a Quest 2- The more in depth review that pushes the Pro will have to be at a later time. 

All in all I have had a pretty fantastic time with the Quest Pro. It's an awesome VR headset and its basically what i always wanted the Quest 2 to be, but I don't know if I could honestly recommend it to most people right now. Most of the promised use cases are non existent; the Pro is just in a weird spot, but i think I have an idea of what it means for Meta and their idea of the VR industry in the future. It's essentially an MR dev kit with possible enterprise applications.
