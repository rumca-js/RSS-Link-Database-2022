As former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gingrich is well known as the architect of the \u201cContract with America\u201d that led the Republican Party to victory in 1994, creating the first conservative majority in the House in 40 years.  He was a Republican candidate for President of the United States in 2012. Gingrich is a Fox News contributor, podcast host (Newt\u2019s World), and syndicated columnist.  He is the author of 41 books, including 18 fiction and nonfiction New York Times bestsellers.
