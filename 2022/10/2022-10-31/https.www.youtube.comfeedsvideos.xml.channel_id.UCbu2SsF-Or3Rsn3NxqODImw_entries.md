We’ve been hacking and slashing at Greek (and sometimes Norse) gods and monsters in God of War since 2005. To celebrate the launch of God of War Ragnarok, let’s take a look at the history of the series.
#GodOfWar #Ragnarok #GameSpot #gaming 

Kratos is a PlayStation icon and has been since the God of War franchise launched in 2005. Over the years, he's overcome many trials and tribulations, had a lot of family issues, and hacked and slashed his way through all manner of Greek gods, titans, and monsters. But the series, known for its over-the-top nature, toned things down a little with God of War (2018), telling a more mature story about a father, his son, and breaking a cycle of violence that had plagued Kratos for ages. The story will reach its conclusion with Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok for PS4 and PS5, so we decided to take a look at each God of War game to see how far Kratos has really come. 
In this video, we chart the history of the God of War franchise, from the game's initial pitch (Onimusha with Greek mythology, plus the puzzles of Ico and some adult themes thrown in for good measure) all the way up to the emotional hardships that Kratos and his son Atreus must face together in God of War (2018) and now Ragnarok. We discuss every mainline God of War game, including sequels, prequels, and even spinoffs, including the beloved Ghost of Sparta for the PSP and lesser-known games like God of War Betrayal or Mimir's Vision.

One of Steam Deck’s most popular games is coming to Game Pass, Modern Warfare 2 leak hints at much beloved mode returning, and Fortnite gets some crucial Star Wars skins. All on today’s GameSpot News.

Vampire Survivors, one of the most played games on Valve’s Steam Deck, plays like an homage to Castlevania where you slowly gather power and turn your supernatural slayer into a mobile tornado of whips, cats, and garlic force-fields. It recently exited its early access phase and is now a full release, and has been exclusive to PC until today's Game Pass announcement confirming an Xbox console release on November 8. It's also currently on Xbox Game Pass for PC.

Released back in October, Return to Monkey Island features series creator Ron Gilbert back in the captain's chair and continues the story of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge. The game got a 9/10 score from GameSpot, with reviewer Richard Wakeling noting that it feels like a "heartfelt and nostalgic adventure" aimed at longtime fans of the series. The game is coming to Game Pass on November 10.

Pentiment is the other big game for the month, a medieval murder mystery with a distinct illustrated style from Obsidian Entertainment. The game unfolds over 25 years during early 16th century Germany, and the entire game looks like it was ripped from the pages of a manuscript from that time period. Pentiment comes to Game Pass on November 15.

You can find the full list of games announced for Game Pass this month in the description below.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has only been out for a few days, but players have already found a bug that allows you to see all of the emblems and calling cards in the game. The volume of alien-themed nameplates has led some players to believe that a Extinction-style mode may be coming to the game.

Modern Warfare II multiplayer launches with some high highs and low lows, Phil Spencer talks more about Call of Duty exclusivity, and EA expands its upcoming Marvel gaming lineup. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II was just released on Friday, and it had a massive launch on PlayStation. The company has announced that Modern Warfare II has become the "biggest PlayStation Store launch" of all time for the Call of Duty series. This includes both preorders and day-one sales, Sony said.

The game is seemingly performing well on other platforms, too (of course), as Modern Warfare II ranks No. 1 on the Xbox best-seller list and is topping the charts on PC via Steam as well.

Something else that should come as no surprise is that the game has had its fair share of issues since releasing also. Developer Infinity Ward has had to disable attachment tuning, a new feature that allowed players to more precisely tweak their weapons, due to game crashes. Pinging is also currently unavailable in the game as a bug would lead to players being permanently pinged and their location highlighted through a match if an opponent were to ping them as their death animation played out.

We on the GameSpot team ourselves have experienced some of these issues. I myself was in the middle of tuning one of my attachments until I backed out and *poof* my tuning was gone. I also was unable to load up the campaign when multiplayer dropped without restarting the mission I was very close to beating. And I also had a price of $5000 attached to all my weapons before starting a match. Our supervising producer Aaron Sampson had random crashes, video producer Jake Dekker had issues with freezing and getting kicked out of games when someone left his party *VO trails off*

Hopefully Activision is able to address these issues with an upcoming patch soon. For more info on everything Modern Warfare II, check out our plethora of videos on the game here at GameSpot.
