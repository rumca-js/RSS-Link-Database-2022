Just when did the covid virus start spreading around the world?

Section III

China’s early COVID-19 Vaccine Development versus the U.S. Operation Warp Speed 

Full genetic sequence, SARS-CoV-2

First posted, global virus database, January 11, 2020

Chinese professor, violated government restrictions

Then

Vaccine developers inserted viral genome into cells to produce viral proteins

Preclinical animal toxicity 

Safety and efficacy studies 

Human clinical safety and efficacy trials

Commercial scale vaccine production. 

Operation Warp Speed

Pre OWS work started on January 11, 2020

E.g. Adenovirus vector vaccines

The AstraZeneca-Oxford, went from sequence to phase I clinical trials in 103 days

(Ebola platform)

J and J was 185 days

Three adenovirus vector vaccines

Pfizer trail started 7th May 2020

Another Chinese vaccine was patented on 24th February 2020 

(Brigadier General Yusen Zhou, Academy of Military Medical Sciences)

Question

Did Chinese researchers have access to the genomic sequence before January 11, 2020? 

If so, how far in advance of January 11, 2020?

In the case of Pfizer

Submitted a clinical trial that started in 14th January 2020

Three days later Pfizer already started a test for these vaccines

Moderna

Trials since 2017

Virus shares a sequence of 19 nucleotides with Moderna genome

Part of spike protein
Coincidence or not a coincidence?

(Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil)

## US Senate, lab origin most likely

Senate report on COVID coronavirus origins

the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic was most likely the result of a research-related incident

Dec. 20, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020

Searches for flu-like symptoms 

Cases probably started mid October, 2019

Analysis of Natural Zoonotic Origins Hypothesis 

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 

Lack of intermediate bats to humans

Virus likely needed to circulate in an intermediate host
 
An animal virus must evolve to gain human infecting potential

Closest virus is in horseshoe bats residing in Southern China or Southeast Asia
 
Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak Differs from Previous Natural Zoonotic Spill overs 

Lack of dead ends spill over events, no epidemiological train in animals or humans

Influenza

Infected poultry and birds always found

H7N9 (2019) multiple independent introductions across multiple locations

Geographically disparate, independent spill overs of H7N9 

Avian Influenza

had circulated in bird populations, 

time and several provinces in China before the first known human infections 

SARS epidemic

At least five independent spill overs of the SARS virus into humans

Live animal markets followed by human to human

E.g. Guangdong Province, November 2002 to January 2003

SARS, later on in 2003 – 2004

Additional independent subsequent spill over infections in humans

Civets identified within 6 months

Early SARS viral samples from humans contained genetic mutations that reflected prior circulation and adaptation in palm civets 

In total contrast

Chinese government, asserted that the COVID-19 originated from a natural zoonotic transmission occurring at the Huanan market

Geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 in China, December 31, 2019 to February 11, 2020

Earliest identified SARS-CoV-2 well-adapted for human-to-human transmission 

Early SARS-CoV-2 variants had little genetic diversity, 2 nucleotides out of 29,900

(Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil)

No evidence of previous intermediate host circulation

Genetic similarity between the environmental samples and human viral samples,

supports the likelihood that the virus found at the Huanan Seafood Market was shed by humans

Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, 

to address pandemic preparedness and response programs

Interim report, to examine the two prevailing theories of origin

Last fifteen months

Reviewed several hundred scientific studies, 

interviewed several dozen subject matter experts, 

analyzed previous reports and studies.
The lack of transparency and collaboration from government and public health officials in the People’s Republic of China with respect to the origins of SARS-CoV-2 prevents reaching a more definitive conclusion. 

I hope this report will guide the World Health Organization and other international institutions

Introduction

Challenging

Since January 3, 2020,
 
People’s Republic of China (PRC) have prohibited sharing or publishing any information on SARS-CoV-2 without state review and approval. 

Establishing timeline, is difficult

Mid October, 2019
