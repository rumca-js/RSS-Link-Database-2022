2022's Halloween Ends continues the return of Michael Myers from 2018's Halloween and 2021's Halloween Kills. They even used the Filmento idea all the way back from my video about first entry, in which Michael Myers shouldn't be only an old man in a mask but more of an idea that can spread and corrupt. Awesome! Unfortunately, that's not enough to save this movie, because it stumbles into a couple horror pitfalls which make it not scary. A horror movie where the horror doesn't work! In today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's see what those pitfalls are so that we can avoid them in our own horror scripts.

Halloween Ends (2022)
This is Laurie Strode’s last stand. After 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. Icon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. Four years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir.

Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all.

Director David Gordon Green’s slasher film is a direct sequel to the 1978 film of the same name.
