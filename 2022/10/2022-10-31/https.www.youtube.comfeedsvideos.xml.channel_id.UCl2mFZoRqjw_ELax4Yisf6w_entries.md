00:00 Introduction
00:48 New policy
01:04 It was "posted in error"
01:14 How is this an error?
01:30 This policy was removed
01:49 $2500 fine is still there
02:01 That's always been there though
02:13 This doesn't mean paypal is good!
02:38 Detailed dive into the policy history
03:24 Misinformation is not mentioned in their policy
04:37 IMO, this was an intentional policy
05:09 It still makes mention of "obscene" 
05:27 WHAT IS OBSCENE?
05:55 Paypal has reversed course after outrage before once news died down
06:10 Paypal did this in 2019 on the 2.9% fee on refunds
07:55 Once one company gets away with it, everyone starts doing it
09:00 Paypal tried to ruin my business in 2013
10:55 You should still consider dumpng Paypal!
11:51 Importance of intellectual honesty even when you dislike someone
