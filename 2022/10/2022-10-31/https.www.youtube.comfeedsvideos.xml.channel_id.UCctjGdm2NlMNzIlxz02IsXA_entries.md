You friend, the local thief here! Fantano is over there in his little kingdom judging entire years based on their musical output. I figured why not cast the same unfair judgement but for video games instead? If you guys like this, we'll do one every week until 2022 and I'm thinking the next one we'll do LIVE on Twitch and we can all participate in the conversation. How's THAT sound? HUH?!?

Figured this'll be decent in between content while I work on bigger Recaps and special surprise projects. Sorry my big videos are taking longer than usual. Really trying to up the ante over here and I'm still just a one man team, old school style. Once you see what I'm working on though, I think you'll be pleased. I've personally never been more stoked. See you next week (if u liked this) If not, I'll see you .... eventually.
