Her partner speaks out in an excerpt from the new documentary \u201cPutin\u2019s War at Home.\u201d\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

She has been in jail awaiting trial ever since \u2014 and if convicted of spreading false information about the Russian armed forces, she faces up to ten years in prison.
