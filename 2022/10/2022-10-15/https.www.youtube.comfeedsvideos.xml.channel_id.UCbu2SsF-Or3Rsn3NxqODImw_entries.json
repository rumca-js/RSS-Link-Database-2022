So here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to, and what I\u2019m not looking forward to in both the campaign & multiplayer.\n\nFrom movie style set pieces, to wicked plot twists, and sick villains, the cod campaigns are something I look forward to every release. Call me casual but I know I\u2019m not the only one who was disappointed when Black Ops 4 didn\u2019t have a campaign. Now so far we\u2019ve only seen the reveal of the Dark Water mission and snippets from the brand new campaign trailer released earlier. Dark Water looked dope to me, but some people online felt that it looked like a rehash of the original Modern Warfare\u2019s opening ship mission which, fair! The cutscenes from the new trailer though? Dude seriously, I had to pause and double take because I thought this was a live-action trailer, the cgi and cutscenes look really awesome and I can not wait to bust it out on my shiny Series X or PC.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, in multiplayer, Activision likes to mess with everything it touches, and a big part of me is warily waiting for something to happen with Modern Warfare 2\u2019s live service model, especially from a \u201cgive me more money\u201d point of view. If not at launch, then almost certainly in future season passes. Modern Warfare 2019 was really tame at launch when it came to cosmetics and microtransactions with a lot of skins being pretty neat mil-sim style stuff. Then along came Warzone and suddenly we got crazier and crazier skins compounded with Black Ops and Vanguard all transitioning their skins across games.\n\nModern Warfare 2 is right around the corner with a weird rolling launch. We\u2019ve got the campaign coming up first in an early access period, then the official base launch with multiplayer, and Warzone 2.0 at its heels with a November launch. We've all enjoyed our time with the multiplayer beta so far so be sure to subscribe for more guides, gameplay, livestreams, and of course our official review score once the game launches. \n\n\nTimestamps: \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:14 Why I'm Excited for the Campaign\n04:02 - Why I'm Excited for the Multiplayer\n07:32 - Campaign & Spec Ops Concerns\n09:24 - The Activision Problem\n\n\n#gaming #cod #modernwarfare2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykkxgTpF9o", "date_published": "2022-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
