I just received my preorder copy of Open Circuits, a new book put out by No Starch Press. And I don't normally post about the books I buy, but THIS book is amazing. Anyone who likes electronics, computers, or engineering should consider picking up a copy.

Seeing inside each component gives me a new understanding when I'm breadboarding or prototyping a circuit designâ€”and why some components tend to fail more easily than others!

You can pre-order it on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3fHTtKT (I bought mine directly from No Starch Press months ago, and they just started shipping it out to the early buyers this week)
