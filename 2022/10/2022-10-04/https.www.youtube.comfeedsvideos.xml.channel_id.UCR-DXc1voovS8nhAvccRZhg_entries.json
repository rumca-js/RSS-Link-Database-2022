And I don't normally post about the books I buy, but THIS book is amazing. Anyone who likes electronics, computers, or engineering should consider picking up a copy.\n\nSeeing inside each component gives me a new understanding when I'm breadboarding or prototyping a circuit design\u2014and why some components tend to fail more easily than others!\n\nYou can pre-order it on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3fHTtKT (I bought mine directly from No Starch Press months ago, and they just started shipping it out to the early buyers this week)\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nMerch: https://redshirtjeff.com\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/GeerlingEngineering", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx0YYt66AGk", "date_published": "2022-10-04 22:38:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
