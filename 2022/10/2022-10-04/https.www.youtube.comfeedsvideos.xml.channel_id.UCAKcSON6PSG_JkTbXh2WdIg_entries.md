Built To Spill’s founder and frontman Doug Martsch is, among many things, a collaborator. And that collaborative nature shines brightly on Built To Spill’s latest album, "When The Wind Forgets Your Name," just released on Sept. 9, 2022. The songs were recorded with the musicians Martsch worked with while spending time touring and playing music in Brazil. Now, Martch has teamed up with Melanie Radford and Teresa Esguerra to create the touring version of Built To Spill. While on that tour, Built To Spill visited The Current studio to play songs and to have this conversation with host Mac Wilson.

During the chat with Mac, we hear more about Radford and Esguerra, and how they came to play with Martsch. We also hear a bit more about Martsch’s time in Brazil — and we enjoy some speculation on just how long the longest Built To Spill song has run in minutes.
