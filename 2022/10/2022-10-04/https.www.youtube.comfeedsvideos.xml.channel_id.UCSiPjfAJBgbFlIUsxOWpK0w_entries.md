LYRICS
Crammed round a table for eight
Everyone having a laugh
You called me your ball and chain
Now why would you do that

Bought my fifth mattress this year
Cause we’ll never be in the black
Our budgets are very clear
Now why would you do that

Sorry I can’t know myself
That’s your job
I fear
Just try not to know too well
I might just surprise you
My dear

Today I was reading a poem
But my eyes skipped over a line
Guess that’s what I don’t want to know
Now why would you do that

And so I’ve been sick for days
But you keep coming up for a chat
I love staring at your face
Oh why would you do that
