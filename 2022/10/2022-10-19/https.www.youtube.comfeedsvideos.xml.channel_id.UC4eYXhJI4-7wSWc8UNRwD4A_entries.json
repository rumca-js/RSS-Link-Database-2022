That question, from her ballad \u201cMemory Song,\u201d is central to the music she and her band offer in this sparkling, thoughtful set. This music originated within McCalla's theater piece about independent station Radio Haiti, Breaking the Thermometer To Hide the Fever, which she transformed into one of 2022\u2019s most compelling albums. From the driving, danceable call to revolution \u201cDodinin\u201d to \u201cNan Fon Bwa,\u201d written by renowned guitarist Frantz Casseus and now a showcase for McCalla\u2019s funky cello work, she and her band \u2014 all players deeply immersed in Haiti\u2019s rhythms and songlines \u2014 enact a historical journey that honors a nation born in revolution and still fighting, despite unfathomable hardship, today.\n\nMcCalla\u2019s parents immigrated to New York as kids, during Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier\u2019s murderous regime. \u201cI\u2019ve been curious about that period in their lives and Haitian history for a long time,\u201d she says, introducing \u201cFort Dimanche,\u201d which samples an interview conducted by Radio Haiti\u2019s cofounder Mich\u00e8le Montas about life within the country\u2019s most notoriously brutal prison. The song begins quietly, led by McCalla\u2019s circular banjo lines, then builds a dream of freedom through the rhythms of Markus Schwartz's congas and Pete Olyinciw\u2019s bowed and plucked upright bass. Memory\u2019s shape is latticework, delicate and non-linear, and McCalla\u2019s songs honor its partial revelations with the grace of deep attention.\n\nSET LIST\nDodinin\nMemory Song\nFort Dimanche\nNan Fon Bwa\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeyla McCalla - vocals, cello, banjo, electric guitar\nPete Olynciw - upright bass\nShawn Myers - drums\nNahum Zdybel - electric guitar\nMarkus Schwartz - Congas\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Natasha Branch\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #LeylaMcCalla", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aX8svdJjZo", "date_published": "2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
