It delivered a year of memorable moments like the Nuke Event and Haunting of Verdansk, kicked off the free-to-play Warzone, and gathered a whole new Call of Duty fanbase. So here we are, finally, the sequel, Modern Warfare 2. Here\u2019s everything you need to know before diving in.

Microsoft goes on to note the range of exclusive titles coming to the console, saying, \"PlayStation also has a spate of first- and third-party exclusive titles lined up for launch in 2023, including Spider-Man 2, Wolverine, Horizon, Final Fantasy XVI and Forspoken.\"\n\nInsomniac is also developing Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and it assured fans just this week that the game would still be out in 2023, but Wolverine doesn't currently have a release window. That makes the inclusion of this title from Microsoft an odd one. It's unclear if Microsoft knows something that we don't, but it's also just possible that there was a misinterpretation about Wolverine's release date on Microsoft's part somewhere along the line.\n\nNext up I want to talk about some free games because who doesn\u2019t love free things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor starters, Sims 4 is free to play now for every platform the game is currently available on\u2013sorry Switch players.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOver on the Epic Games Store you can grab the game of the year edition of the classic RPG Fallout 3. And if you\u2019re ok with splitting your purchases between multiple storefronts\u2013and why wouldn\u2019t you when the game is free\u2013then you can also grab a Microsoft Store version of Fallout 76 from Amazon Prime Gaming. Keep in mind that you have to be an active Prime member to take advantage of that deal.\u00a0\n\nWhile you\u2019re grabbing the 76 code, you might as well grab the free copy of Middle-earth: Shadow of War that is redeemable in the GOG Store.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to the newest games you can play on PlayStation Plus, make sure to check out our latest video in which Lucy James walks you through what's on offer this month for subscribers.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpai6gPhjU4", "date_published": "2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Livestream", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 kicks off it's early access campaign for players who preordered the full game.
