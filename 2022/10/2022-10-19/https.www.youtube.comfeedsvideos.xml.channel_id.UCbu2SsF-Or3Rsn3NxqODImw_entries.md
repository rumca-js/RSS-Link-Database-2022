 #gaming #gamename #gamespot 

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2019 delivered a very different take on Call of Duty, one that appealed to mil-sim fans, lapsed Battlefield players, and folks ready to try large open maps, all while coming in hot with a campaign as fiery and as controversial as the original Modern Warfare 2. It delivered a year of memorable moments like the Nuke Event and Haunting of Verdansk, kicked off the free-to-play Warzone, and gathered a whole new Call of Duty fanbase. So here we are, finally, the sequel, Modern Warfare 2. Here’s everything you need to know before diving in. Let's talk campaign, Gunsmith 2.0, gear, Battle Maps, Core Multiplayer, Spec-Ops, Warzone 2.0, and Raids. 

Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone are multiplatform releases, on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. PC includes Steam. This time around, there is a multi-week launch with early access campaign on October 20, a full launch on October 28, a Warzone 2.0 and DMZ launch on November 16, and an unspecified by end of year release for Raids.

Check out this new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI!

Who shall claim their fading light?
From a single spark, will the land ignite
A new shadow rises to fall upon the Dominants,
painting their destinies black as night.

It has been fifteen hundred years since the fall of our forebears, and Valisthea has been slowly dying ever since. Darkness spreads as day gives way to twilight, the Mothers' flame now all but a flicker. And as the fringes fade, the people flock to the Mothercrystals.

COMING SUMMER 2023

## Gotham Knights Review

Gotham Knights acts as more of a cautionary tale than the logical next step for this storied universe.
#gothamknights #GameSpot #Batman 

Batman is dead. With so few words, Gotham Knights is instantly intriguing. What does Gotham look like without its Dark Knight perched over the rotten city? For Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood, their leader's sudden demise leaves a massive hole in the heart of Gotham, and asks them to step out from his shadow. Although the new guard fares well from a narrative standpoint, the gameplay systems built to serve their 30-hour campaign to reclaim Gotham let the team down.

## Insomniac’s Wolverine Launch Window, According To Microsoft | GameSpot News

Microsoft may have revealed the Wolverine release window and we round up this week’s free games and Halloween events. 
#GamingNews #Wolverine #PS5  

As spotted by Tech4Gamers, some recent filings from Microsoft in relation to the UK's Activision Blizzard acquisition investigation claim that Wolverine will release in 2023.

In the document, Microsoft noted how PlayStation has a "large portfolio of high-quality exclusive content," arguing that the latter wouldn't be massively affected by the acquisition. Microsoft goes on to note the range of exclusive titles coming to the console, saying, "PlayStation also has a spate of first- and third-party exclusive titles lined up for launch in 2023, including Spider-Man 2, Wolverine, Horizon, Final Fantasy XVI and Forspoken."

Insomniac is also developing Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and it assured fans just this week that the game would still be out in 2023, but Wolverine doesn't currently have a release window. That makes the inclusion of this title from Microsoft an odd one. It's unclear if Microsoft knows something that we don't, but it's also just possible that there was a misinterpretation about Wolverine's release date on Microsoft's part somewhere along the line.

Next up I want to talk about some free games because who doesn’t love free things.  

For starters, Sims 4 is free to play now for every platform the game is currently available on–sorry Switch players.  

Over on the Epic Games Store you can grab the game of the year edition of the classic RPG Fallout 3. And if you’re ok with splitting your purchases between multiple storefronts–and why wouldn’t you when the game is free–then you can also grab a Microsoft Store version of Fallout 76 from Amazon Prime Gaming. Keep in mind that you have to be an active Prime member to take advantage of that deal. 

While you’re grabbing the 76 code, you might as well grab the free copy of Middle-earth: Shadow of War that is redeemable in the GOG Store. 

When it comes to the newest games you can play on PlayStation Plus, make sure to check out our latest video in which Lucy James walks you through what's on offer this month for subscribers.

Kurt Indovina got hands-on time with Resident Evil 4 Remake, and it's shaping up to be the remake fans may want, but not the one they're expecting.

When Capcom officially announced it was remaking Resident Evil 4, Kurt was apprehensive. The original Resident Evil 4 is not without its blemishes--it is, after all, a 17-year-old game. But tank controls and Ashley Graham aside, his apprehension was largely tied to whether Capcom could capture the spirit of the original. 

After 30 minutes of playing Resident Evil 4 Remake, Kurt can say that most of his concerns have been washed away. While brief, his time with the demo showed him that this could be the Resident Evil 4 Remake fans want, but not the one they're expecting. And this approach can be illustrated by a single choice Capcom has made involving a dog--you know the one.

Just like the Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes before, the Resident Evil 4 Remake looks to be a complete reworking of the original game. Where-as RE2 and RE3 worked in elements of Resident Evil 4 to their gameplay, Resident Evil 4’s Remake has larger environments and enhanced gameplay mechanics, all with a graphics overhaul. Please keep in mind the game is still in development, so everything we show here is subject to change.

We’ve got another update in the Microsoft & Activision Blizzard investigation as well as Silent Hill and Disney news.
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

The Competition and Markets Authority has so far expressed a number of concerns related to Microsoft and Activision Blizzard’s deal. One concern is how it has the potential to have a major impact on Sony if Activision Blizzard content is made exclusive to Xbox. 

In response to the CMA’s decision to enter a second phase of investigation into the proposed $69 billion deal, Microsoft highlighted footnote references to a tweet from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that said, "The agreement between Activision Blizzard and Sony includes restrictions on the ability of Activision Blizzard to place Call of Duty titles on Game Pass for a number of years.” 

After months of speculation and reports, Konami officially confirmed its Silent Hill 2 remake during the Silent Hill Transmission video presentation. The game, which opened the presentation with an impressive trailer, looks to be rebuilt from the ground up while still keeping the essence of the 2001 original intact.

The trailer gives us a look at the new James Sunderland, who has ventured to Silent Hill to rescue his wife Mary--long believed dead. We see some signature series elements in the trailer, as well, including the fog-filled streets and a few familiar enemies. Those, naturally, include Pyramid Head.

The Sunlit Plateau has fallen under darkness, and Scar--who wants to make that area his home--recruits the player to set things right. A new set of Star Path rewards are also available, which will let players earn Halloween-themed clothes and decorations to give their version of Dreamlight Valley a spooky spin.

The update also includes multiple bug fixes, from minor elements like Mickey's weird eyes and lightning flashes to game-breaking bugs. For example, memory pieces that would spawn inside the counter at Scrooge's store no longer do so, which allows players to finish questlines for multiple characters.
