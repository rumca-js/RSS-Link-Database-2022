We kept real spending growth flat across the forward estimates. We have got the debt down over the forward estimates. We have let 99% of the temporary revenue surge from higher commodity prices flow through to the budget.</p><p>That is good progress when we have shown in doing that \u2026 you can move sensibly on all fronts, restraint, trimming spending, sensible tax reform, you can make the budget more sustainable and that will be the task of the two or three budgets remaining in this parliamentary term as well.</p><p>We need to work out how do we maintain a focus on Australians with a disability and their families, how do we put them front and centre, and at the same time make sure that spending on the NDIS is sustainable and important part of that is making sure we get value for money for every dollar that is spent in what is a really important, really, really important service that we provide to Australians.</p><p>I do understand there is a substantial part of the community that would prefer that that PRRT take was higher.</p><p>We haven\u2019t been working up an option to do that to change the PRRT arrangements but the treasury has been commissioned by my predecessor and by his predecessor to do some of this work around the taxing point in the PRRT.</p><p>We do want to make sure Australians get a good return for their resources. We need to balance that against the investment that\u2019s been made into the sector. When I get that advice from I will engage in it a meaningful way and I will listen to it.</p><p>We have seen I think as you acknowledged in your first question, on this topic, company taxes are up quite substantially. That\u2019s a good thing and we have let that flow through to the budget. The PRRT, there\u2019s a modest increase. I will wait to see what the treasury advises us on the conclusion of the review that my two predecessors put in place.</p> <a
