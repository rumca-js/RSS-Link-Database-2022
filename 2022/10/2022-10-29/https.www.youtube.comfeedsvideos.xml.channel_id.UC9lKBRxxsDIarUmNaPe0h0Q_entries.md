Your carbon footprint is a total lie, and it was created by none other than British Petroleum, otherwise known as BP.

BP created the term "carbon footprint" as part of a massive global advertising campaign, designed to take the blame off them for creating some of the most damaging and devastating products on the planet, and put the blame onto normal people. And of course, this was all about money, so they could continue to make billions per year in profits.
