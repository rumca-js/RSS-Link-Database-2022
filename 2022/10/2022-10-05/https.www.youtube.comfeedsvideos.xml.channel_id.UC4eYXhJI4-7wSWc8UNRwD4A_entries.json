In addition to their instruments, her band members play the desk they sit around itself, an organic setting that blurs the boundaries between music and context. \u201cEstamos aqui, todos unidos por la m\u00fasica en este bello pupitre,\u201d she laughs: \u201cWe\u2019re here, all united by music at this beautiful desk.\u201d The percussive fugue of \u201cMolino Molero\u201d ends sharply before, by contrast, the unwound and languorous \u201cD\u00e4mmerung\u201d stretches beneath her clarion voice. \n\nIn addition to being a musician, Baca has worked as  an ethnomusicologist, a schoolteacher and Peru\u2019s former Minister of Culture; she\u2019s a curator of folklore and culture of the highest order. Throughout her El Tiny performance, the camera shifts to an overhead shot of the desk, featuring her 2021 album Palabras Urgentes beside several books and a note that says \u201cEres lo que lees\u201d (You are what you read). Her performance, like all of her music, is intimate because it\u2019s situated, musically and thematically, in a specific time and place.\n\nAcross her many careers, Baca\u2019s work is always in service of preserving and honoring African and Indigenous art forms. Her rendition of \u201cSorongo,\u201d written by Puerto Rican composer Tite Curet Alonso, is an electric and pulsing homage, transmuting the salsa of the original to a meditation driven by the drums, caj\u00f3n and cheko, grounding the narrative of African enslavement across Latin America in Afro-Peruvian percussion. The same goes for her closer, a salsafied version of Chabuca Granda\u2019s \u201cCanterur\u00edas,\u201d which she introduces as \u201cAfro-Peruvian bonus track en Babel!\u201d\n\nIn this library, you are what you read. Joyfully running her hands along the spines of books behind her, Baca reminds us not just of the essential texts, but how to examine them with intention, precision and rapture.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cMolino Molero\u201d\n\u201cD\u00e4mmerung\u201d\n\u201cSorongo\u201d\n\u201cCanterur\u00edas\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nSusana Baca: vocals\n\u00d3scar Huaranga: bass\nJonathan Mendoza: acoustic guitar, vocals\nAlex Quijandr\u00eda: percussion, vocals\nManuel Mej\u00eda: percussion, vocals\nLuis Miguel: percussion\nRenzo Vignati: electric guitar\nJuan Carlos: piano, violin\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Ricardo Pereira\nDirector: Giancarlo Aponte\nCameras: Gustavo de la Torre Casal, William Marquina, Jair Guill\u00e9n, Fernando Galv\u00e1n\nArt and Styling: Amaro Casanova\nCamera Grip & Dolly: Omar Salazar\nEditing and Color: Giancarlo Aponte\nAudio Recording Engineer: Fico Hoyle\nMixing and Mastering: \u00d3scar Huaranga\nFilmed at Babel library and bookstore\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer, Felix Contreras, Fi O'Reilly\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #eltiny #susanabaca #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiGD2vOqDk", "date_published": "2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
