And that collaborative nature shines brightly on Built To Spill\u2019s latest album, \"When The Wind Forgets Your Name,\" just released on Sept. 9, 2022. The songs were recorded with the musicians Martsch worked with while spending time touring and playing music in Brazil. Now, Martch has teamed up with Melanie Radford and Teresa Esguerra to create the touring version of Built To Spill. While on that tour, Built To Spill visited The Current studio to play songs and to have this conversation with host Mac Wilson.\n\nDuring the chat with Mac, we hear more about Radford and Esguerra, and how they came to play with Martsch. We also hear a bit more about Martsch\u2019s time in Brazil \u2014 and we enjoy some speculation on just how long the longest Built To Spill song has run in minutes. \n\nWatch and listen to the full session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cI-uH2aySA\n\nBand Members\nDoug Martsch\nMelanie Radford\nTeresa Esguerra\n\nCredits\nHost \u2013 Mac Wilson\nGuests \u2013 Built To Spill\nProducer \u2013 Rachel Frances\nVideo \u2013 Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operators \u2013 Thor Cramer Bornemann\nAudio \u2013 Evan Clark\nGraphics \u2013 Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013 Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
