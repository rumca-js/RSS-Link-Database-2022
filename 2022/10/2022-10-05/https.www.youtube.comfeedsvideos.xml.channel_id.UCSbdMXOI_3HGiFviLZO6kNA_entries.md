Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! WHAT A CRAZY WEEK.

The Oculus Quest 3 has been leaked almost in its entirety, Meta Connect is one its way, Gamestop gets heavily involved in VR retail, smelling VR? AND OF COURSE, the massively divisive game known as Bonelab. Analyzing the game and its launch a week later. Color me impressed, whether Quest 2 or PCVR, Bonelab has been doing awesome; whether you hate it or not.
