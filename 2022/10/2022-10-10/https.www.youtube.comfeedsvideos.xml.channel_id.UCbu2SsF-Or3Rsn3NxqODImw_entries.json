Bastion will completely be unavailable in any modes, but players can still select Torbjorn in Quick Play. Blizzard didn't state which exact character bugs it's fixing, but reports of Bastion being able to infinitely shoot during his ult upon certain conditions have been going around. Torbjorn's bug appears to be a lengthened duration of his Overload ability. Beyond those two heroes who are intentionally temporarily gone, players also reported that they can't access other heroes on their roster. Blizzard confirmed the bug and said it is looking into the issue.\n\nOverwatch 2 went down for emergency maintenance late in the evening on October 10. But right after the maintenance ended, Blizzard reported another DDOS attack. It seems the company just can't catch a break during Overwatch 2's long-awaited launch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeP2rN7j3rI", "date_published": "2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet and Violet - 11 BIGGEST Changes", "description": "The next mainline Pokemon game is almost here, and with it come a handful of exciting changes.

Wild Hearts is a game about exploring large open areas, alone or with two other players, to take down gigantic monsters that move around the map as you fight them. And the developers don't entirely shy away from that comparison--but they're aspiring to do something much more than replicate Monster Hunter.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbZmW-GAT30", "date_published": "2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
