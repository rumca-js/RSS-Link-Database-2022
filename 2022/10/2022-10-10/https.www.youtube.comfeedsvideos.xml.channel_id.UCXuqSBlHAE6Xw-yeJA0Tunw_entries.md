Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce RTX 4090 is a GPU that‚Äôs been rumoured to be a power-hungry beast since it was first leaked. Is it really that bad? And can its gaming performance possibly justify its massive price tag?

As the first Intel dGPU in over 20 years, the A380 stumbled out of the gate with buggy drivers and so-so gaming performance‚Ä¶ but when we saw the prices of NVIDIA‚Äôs RTX 4000 series GPUs, it got us thinking‚Ä¶ maybe there‚Äôs another way to get next-gen features like AV1‚Ä¶

Huge thanks to EposVox for helping us with this video! Check out what they have to say about AV1 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctbTTRoqZsM
