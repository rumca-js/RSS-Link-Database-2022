It's designed to run on ARM based devices for now, there doesn't seem to be any builds for x86 devices yet.\n\nBigscreen is controlled through your TV remote directly, with the CEC protocol, and is designed with a big launcher to let you run apps optimized for your TV. It also integrates mycroft, to control the interface with your voice, and uses mycroft skills to enrich the experience. \n\nAll the little pop-ups from the plasmoids you embed in your panels, they're now resizeable, and they'll remember their size.\n\nThe kickoff menu has a compact mode, and you can now click on a letter to get a selector that lets you jump to one letter specifically in the list. \n\nOn horizontal panels, you can now also add a label to the applications menu.\n\nAnd if you like to try out alternative launchers, the plasmoid settings are now saved.\n\nThe calendar widget can now also display dates from different calendars. The media controller widget will be able to display the title, artist, and album art of the currently playing track.\n\nBreeze inactive tabs are now a bit less dark when using dark mode, and keyboard shortcuts use a lighter color in context menus. Buttons and comboboxes now also won't use a gradient.\n\nWhen using the accent color from the wallpaper, KDE will now grab the most dominant color.\n\nIn the overview, you can now search in it to filter windows by title.\n\nThere's also a nice improvement to how Plasma handles wallpapers: first, you can preview them now by just clicking on them in the Wallpaper settings panel. Plasma also now handles wallpapers using different images, one for light mode, and one for dark mode, and you can now use animated images as wallpapers as well.\n\nNews is the ability to rebind the mouse buttons from the system settings. On Wayland, you have the option to choose how things are scaled. You can let the compositor scale everything, or you can choose to let windows scale themselves.\n\nYou also get a lot more options in the Night Color settings. First, you can now choose a manual location to enable the feature, and KDE will use this timezone to automatically change the color.\nAnd you can now set 2 different colors: one for the day, and one for the night.\n\nDiscover will now let you change the frequency of update notifications. You can choose to have these notifications that remind you to update your system either daily, weekly, monthly or never. \n\nThere's also a new message box when viewing a beta app whose version is lower than the stable version, to avoid users installing old betas when they think they're getting the latest and greatest. And when you're viewing a beta version of an app in Discover, you'll also get a message box to let you know this is the case.\n\nOn app pages, you also get a share button. You'll also be able to see content ratings for apps that have them. You can also change the name you'll use to leave a review on an app, and Discover will now check to see if there's enough free space on disk before updating.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iensgc4QTIs", "date_published": "2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
