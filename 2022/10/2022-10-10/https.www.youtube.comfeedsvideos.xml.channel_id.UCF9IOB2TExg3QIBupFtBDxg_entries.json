Godlee, editor in chief\n\nKamran Abbasi, incoming editor in chief\nThe BMJ\n\nCompeting interests:\n\nAs current and incoming editors in chief, we are responsible for everything The BMJ contains.\n\nDear Mark Zuckerberg,\n\nThe BMJ, one of the world\u2019s oldest and most influential general medical journals. \n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/history-of-the-bmj\n\n3rd October 1840\n\nSerious concerns about the \u201cfact checking\u201d \n\nbeing undertaken by third party providers on behalf of Facebook/Meta.\n\nIn September, a former employee of Ventavia, a contract research company helping carry out the main Pfizer covid-19 vaccine trial, began providing The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.\n\nThese materials revealed a host of poor clinical trial research practices occurring at Ventavia that could impact data integrity and patient safety. \n\nWe also discovered that, despite receiving a direct complaint about these problems over a year ago, the FDA did not inspect Ventavia\u2019s trial sites.\n\nThe BMJ commissioned an investigative reporter to write up the story for our journal. \n\nThe article was published on 2 November, (2021) following legal review, external peer review and subject to The BMJ\u2019s usual high level editorial oversight and review.\n\nCovid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trial\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635\n\nBut from November 10, readers began reporting a variety of problems when trying to share our article. \n\nSome reported being unable to share it. \n\nMany others reported having their posts flagged with a warning about \u201cMissing context \u2026 Independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people.\u201d \n\nThose trying to post the article were informed by Facebook that people who repeatedly share \u201cfalse information\u201d might have their posts moved lower in Facebook\u2019s News Feed. \n\nGroup administrators where the article was shared received messages from Facebook informing them that such posts were \u201cpartly false.\u201d\n\nReaders were directed to a \u201cfact check\u201d performed by a Facebook contractor named Lead Stories.\n\nFact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying And Ignored Reports Of Flaws In Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\n\nhttps://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-british-medical-journal-did-not-reveal-disqualifying-and-ignored-reports-of-flaws-in-pfizer-vaccine-trial.html\n\nWe find the \u201cfact check\u201d performed by Lead Stories to be inaccurate, incompetent and irresponsible.\n\n\u2013 It fails to provide any assertions of fact that The BMJ article got wrong\n\n\u2013 It has a nonsensical title: \u201cFact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying And Ignored Reports Of Flaws In Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\u201d\n\n\u2013 The first paragraph inaccurately labels The BMJ a \u201cnews blog\u201d\n\n\u2013 It contains a screenshot of our article with a stamp over it stating \u201cFlaws Reviewed,\u201d despite the Lead Stories article not identifying anything false or untrue in The BMJ article\n\n\u2013 It published the story on its website under a URL that contains the phrase \u201choax-alert\u201d\n\nWe have contacted Lead Stories, but they refuse to change anything about their article or actions that have led to Facebook flagging our article.\n\nWe have also contacted Facebook directly, requesting immediate removal of the \u201cfact checking\u201d label and any link to the Lead Stories article, thereby allowing our readers to freely share the article on your platform.\n\nThere is also a wider concern that we wish to raise. \n\nWe are aware that The BMJ is not the only high quality information provider to have been affected by the incompetence of Meta\u2019s fact checking regime.\n\nTo give one other example, we would highlight the treatment by Instagram (also owned by Meta) of Cochrane, the international provider of high quality systematic reviews of the medical evidence.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cochranecollab/status/1458439812357185536", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqDu9ZCP_c", "date_published": "2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false,
