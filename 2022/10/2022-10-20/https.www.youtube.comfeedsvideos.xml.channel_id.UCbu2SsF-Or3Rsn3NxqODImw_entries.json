It\u2019s been a long four years since Kratos and Atreus blew us away in God of War (2018), and now it\u2019s finally time to conclude their story. The GameSpot team has been playing God of War Ragnarok, and in the video above, give their spoiler-free impressions on its opening hours, and so far, so good.\u00a0\n\nGod of War Ragnarok takes place a few years after the end of God of War, with Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir spending the years training and preparing for the impending Ragnarok. Tamoor, Lucy, and Jake discuss how the emotional opening sets up the rest of the game and how Ragnarok feels familiar but makes some subtle changes.\u00a0\n\nFor more God of War Ragnarok, head over to gamespot.com to read Tamoor's impressions, and make sure to subscribe to YouTube.com/GameSpot for our God of War Ragnarok review.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epIbDEGG3OI", "date_published": "2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Is Code Veronica Getting a Remake? | GameSpot News", "description": "Resident Evil producer opens up about a Code Veronica remake, Resident Evil 4 Remake gets a new gameplay trailer and Village gets a third person demo.\n#GamingNews #RE #ResidentEvil\n\nDuring an interview with Noisy Pixel, Resident Evil producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that Capcom currently has no plans to remake Resident Evil: Code Veronica. If you\u2019re new to the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica is a cult classic that was first released as a Dreamcast exclusive, but eventually came to the PlayStation 2 with more cutscenes. The game is set between Resident Evil 2 and 3; games that had remakes released in 2019 and 2020 respectively. So it's only natural to wonder if Capcom plans to redo this middle story as well. \n\nLuckily for fans, that lack of plans doesn\u2019t seem to be set in stone and Hirabayashi added that the opportunity for a Code Veronica remake hadn't been ruled out entirely. In the meantime, if you find yourself needing to play the game on current-gen hardware, you can check out the 2011 remaster on Xbox Series X|S via backward compatibility. \n\nWhile that Resident Evil game won't be getting a remake yet, one of the most beloved entries in the series will be getting a massive overhaul next year. Resident Evil 4 will arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S on March 24, 2023, and a new trailer showed off more of the game's big set piece moments and creepy monsters during Capcom's latest showcase.\n\nThere is currently an RE4 Remake hands-on preview on the GameSpot YouTube channel right now in which Kurt Indovina walks you through his time with the game.\n\nFull Video: https://youtu.be/6DXTWwxZeA4", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_GEKFX_Jfg", "date_published": "2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet And Violet: Big Changes Explained", "description": "This isn't Pokemon Legends: Arceus, but in some ways it's taking even bigger swings with the franchise formula.\n\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet are just around the corner and GameSpot's editor Steve Watts got to check it out for over an hour.

Microsoft goes on to note the range of exclusive titles coming to the console, saying, \"PlayStation also has a spate of first- and third-party exclusive titles lined up for launch in 2023, including Spider-Man 2, Wolverine, Horizon, Final Fantasy XVI and Forspoken.\"\n\nInsomniac is also developing Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and it assured fans just this week that the game would still be out in 2023, but Wolverine doesn't currently have a release window. That makes the inclusion of this title from Microsoft an odd one. It's unclear if Microsoft knows something that we don't, but it's also just possible that there was a misinterpretation about Wolverine's release date on Microsoft's part somewhere along the line.\n\nNext up I want to talk about some free games because who doesn\u2019t love free things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor starters, Sims 4 is free to play now for every platform the game is currently available on\u2013sorry Switch players.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOver on the Epic Games Store you can grab the game of the year edition of the classic RPG Fallout 3.

Keep in mind that you have to be an active Prime member to take advantage of that deal.\u00a0\n\nWhile you\u2019re grabbing the 76 code, you might as well grab the free copy of Middle-earth: Shadow of War that is redeemable in the GOG Store.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to the newest games you can play on PlayStation Plus, make sure to check out our latest video in which Lucy James walks you through what's on offer this month for subscribers.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpai6gPhjU4", "date_published": "2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Livestream", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 kicks off it's early access campaign for players who preordered the full game.
