The Pomplamoose team and I have been working on this band for 6 months now. To learn more about why we’re creating Magaziine, just watch the vlog at the end of the video!

In the meantime, I have to give a MASSIVE THANK YOU to the core Pomplamoose team for all their incredible, creative work spinning up this project.
