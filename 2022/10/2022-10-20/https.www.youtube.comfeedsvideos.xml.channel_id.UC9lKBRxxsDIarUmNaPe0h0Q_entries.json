This is a story very few are talking about, and it's got everything to do with the US dollar possibly going back to a gold standard... and evidence many other nations want to do the same.\n\nRecently, the Republican party in the United States introduced bill H.R. 9157, which is designed to bring the US dollar back onto a gold standard. The thing is, this will probably be opposed by Joe Biden's government. However, even if the US isn't paying attention to gold, it seems the rest of the world is.\n\nFor the last few years, central banks around the world have been buying up gold like crazy. Going on a spending spree and adding to their reserves, increasing their holdings by up to several thousand percent. And this has a lot to do with the Bank of International Settlements, which has once again put gold on the rise.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - The big golden comeback\n2:55 - Why a gold standard may not happen\n4:21 - Masterworks insert\n5:29 - The BIS is why gold is hot again\n8:27 - Why I think it's a good bet\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
