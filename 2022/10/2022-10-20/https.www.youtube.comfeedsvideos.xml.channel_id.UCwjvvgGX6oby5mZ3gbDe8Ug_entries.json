The overall lowering of water levels in the middle and lower reaches will lead to serious water shortages in these areas. For example, if the water level in the midstream section of Wuhan City is low, the water level in the downstream section of Jiujiang City in Jiangxi Province, Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu Province, and Shanghai will be low. The low water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will produce a phenomenon, that is, the seawater at the mouth of the Yangtze River will pour in. For the city of Shanghai, this year's record lack of rain and high temperatures have exacerbated the \"salty water\" crisis Shanghai currently experiences. This should also be the underlying reason for the unprecedented panic felt by Shanghai residents.\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
