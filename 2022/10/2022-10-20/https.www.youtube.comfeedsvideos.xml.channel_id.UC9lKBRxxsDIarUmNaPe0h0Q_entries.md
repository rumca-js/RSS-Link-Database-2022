A great money reset is happening, possibly because of gold. This is a story very few are talking about, and it's got everything to do with the US dollar possibly going back to a gold standard... and evidence many other nations want to do the same.

Recently, the Republican party in the United States introduced bill H.R. 9157, which is designed to bring the US dollar back onto a gold standard. The thing is, this will probably be opposed by Joe Biden's government. However, even if the US isn't paying attention to gold, it seems the rest of the world is.

For the last few years, central banks around the world have been buying up gold like crazy. Going on a spending spree and adding to their reserves, increasing their holdings by up to several thousand percent. And this has a lot to do with the Bank of International Settlements, which has once again put gold on the rise.
