It\u2019s a seemingly simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. We\u2019ll be hanging out with some jumping spiders (the cutest of all spiders) and some jumping spider researchers to investigate how a thumbnail-sized creature with a poppy seed-sized brain ended up evolving some of the most advanced eyes in the animal kingdom, overcoming a few limitations of physics in the process. We\u2019ll watch as scientists study these spiders in a special eye tracking machine and learn how having 8 eyes instead of two gives these elite predators almost 360\u02da vision and almost hawk-level depth perception and resolution.\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/how-jumping-spiders-see/home\n\nBig thanks to:\nDr. Beth Jakob and Alex Winsor - UMass Amherst http://ejakob.popslice.com/\nDr. Nathan Morehouse and lab - University of Cincinnati https://homepages.uc.edu/~morehonn/\n\nAdditional footage credits:\nSpider retinal movements - Daniel Zurek\nSpider courtship videos - Daniel Zurek, Sebastian Echeverri, and Nathan Morehouse (Morehouse Lab, University of Cincinnati)\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss a video! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub \nWe\u2019re on PATREON!
