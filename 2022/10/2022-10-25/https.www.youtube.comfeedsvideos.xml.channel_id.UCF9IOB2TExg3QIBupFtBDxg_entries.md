It (EU) took measures to help compress the development timeline for vaccines from 10-15 years to 12-24 months. 

November 2021

Commission had signed €71 billion worth of contracts

to purchase up to 4.6 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses. 

EU population

2021, 447.01 million 

(more than 10 vaccines each)

Contracts never released to the public

The EU had to act ahead of clear scientific data on vaccine candidates’ safety and efficacy, 

and therefore chose to back a range of candidates 

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dominates the portfolio in 2022-2023 because of, according to the Commission, the company’s ability to reliably supply the EU.

No immediate loosening of zero-Covid strategy

Zero-Covid, people's war to stop the spread of the virus

Recent weeks

Tens of millions, confined home

60 towns and cities

Dynamic zero-Covid, linked to Mr Xi

Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes, travel restrictions

Trains out of Xinjiang suspended

Roadblocks

Widespread reports, food and medicine

Quarantine centres, family separations

IDs linked to health code apps

No vaccine compulsion

(Local vaccines only)

Professor Liang Wannian, government Covid expert panel

Zero-Covid might come to an end?

It's hard to say

Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. 

We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines.

So the heart is a muscular structure, tell us about this muscle

What happens if this myocardium becomes inflammed?

What can cause myocarditis?

How would you recognise myocarditis?

What are the possible outcomes of myocarditis?

How much myocarditis are we seeing now and has this incidence changed of late?

Then much the same series of questions for pericarditis

Getting back to the myocardium, if this is an actively contractile muscle, I guess it needs a good blood supply?

What can go wrong with these coronary arteries?

What is this atherosclerosis and atheroma?

How long does it take for this furring up of the coronary arteries to develop?

Any changes in the rate of development in recent times?

What is a coronary arterial plaque, how can this lead to clots?

Can inflammatory processes lead to plaque instability?

What is a MI, is this the same as a heart attack?

What is a cardiac arrest?

How would a cardiac arrest be treated?

What is the difference between a heart attack and heart failure?
