I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of New York early 1950s  we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, Park Avenue, cars, people walking in the street, horse carriages and more, newest car seen, 1951 oldsmobile

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
