Why do spiders have 8 eyes? Itâ€™s a seemingly simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. Weâ€™ll be hanging out with some jumping spiders (the cutest of all spiders) and some jumping spider researchers to investigate how a thumbnail-sized creature with a poppy seed-sized brain ended up evolving some of the most advanced eyes in the animal kingdom, overcoming a few limitations of physics in the process. Weâ€™ll watch as scientists study these spiders in a special eye tracking machine and learn how having 8 eyes instead of two gives these elite predators almost 360Ëš vision and almost hawk-level depth perception and resolution.
