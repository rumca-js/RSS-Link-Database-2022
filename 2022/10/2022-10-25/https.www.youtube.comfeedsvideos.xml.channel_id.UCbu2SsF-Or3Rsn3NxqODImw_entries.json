Multiplayer will arrive for all players on October 28, though those wanting to experience Warzone 2.0 will have to wait a bit longer, as the free-to-play battle royale isn't arriving until November 16.\n\nModes in Modern Warfare II are broken down into two categories: Core Map modes and Battle Map modes. Core Map modes are smaller, 6v6 combat zones players familiar with the series are no doubt accustomed to. Battle Map modes, however, are built for 32v32 game types and include vehicles.\n\nAnd sticking with the multiplayer news, a recent job listing at Naughty Dog might be pointing towards the untitled The Last of Us multiplayer title being free-to-play.\n\nAs spotted by Reddit user JadedDarkness, shared to the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, a live ops producer role posted by Naughty Dog seems to suggest that the studio's multiplayer The Last of Us game might be free-to-play. In the bonus skills section, one of the points listed reads, \"Proven experience in a production role supporting a AAA, free to play, live title.\"\n\nNaughty Dog hasn't announced a free-to-play title, but last year the studio was looking for an economy designer for a multiplayer game with live service elements, which was prior to the official reveal that The Last of Us multiplayer would be a standalone title. Considering Sony has plans to launch 12 live service games by 2025, a free-to-play, multiplayer The Last of Us would fit quite nicely in there.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMMOO0-E9xs", "date_published": "2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Callisto Protocol Isn't Just Another Dead Space", "description": "GameSpot had the opportunity to check out Striking Distance's survival horror game, The Callisto Protocol.

The same man behind Devil May Cry, and the advent of the arcadey combo-heavy 3D action game style. So, after creating a 2D game in a similar style via Viewtiful Joe, Kamiya created what would become another beloved combo-heavy action game -  Bayonetta.\nBayonetta took what Devil May Cry started, and added a stylistic new protagonist in its titular character, as well as stand out, gigantic boss fights. Her clothing is her hair, which she also uses for magic and to summon demons, and there\u2019s overt sexual overtones throughout.\nBayonetta 3 releases October 28, 2022\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:18 - Development\n1:46 - Gameplay\n4:58 - Story\n5:36 - Controversy\n8:08 - Release Date", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNdtz6JAc6w", "date_published": "2022-10-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Free PS Plus For November 2022 Leaked | GameSpot News", "description": "November\u2019s free games for PlayStation Plus and Amazon Prime Gaming have reportedly leaked.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #PSPlus #PS5 \n\nNioh 2 is a yokai-slaying action game from Team Ninja that combines the pinpoint swordplay of Ninja Gaiden with the mechanics of Dark Souls.

Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of Nioh 2 will be free.\n\nThe Lego Harry Potter Collection is not the most recent Lego video game out there, as it was released in 2016, but it's regarded as one of the best by reviewers and fans alike. This collection combines Years 1-4 and Years 5-7 into one game. If you've already blasted your way through the recent Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, it's a good next step.\n\nThe physics-based puzzle game Heavenly Bodies rounds out November's selection of games. It allows players to explore a zero-gravity environment, solve puzzles, and collect space goodies. The PS5 and PS4 versions of Heavenly Bodies will be available to claim.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is developed by Obsidian Entertainment originally released in 2010 for consoles and PC.
