For some unknown reason, this option in Modern Warfare 2 is only available to PS5 and PS4 players, meaning Xbox and PC players are stuck being lumped into cross-play lobbies unless developer Infinity Ward makes a change.\n\nXbox players do have the ability to circumvent this omission at a system level, toggling off support for cross-play that will apply to all games on the system. If you want to disable cross-play at a system level on Xbox, you can follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Settings menu on the Xbox console\nGo to the General tab and choose \u2018Online safety & family\u2019\nChoose \u2018Privacy & online safety\u2019 then \u2018Xbox Live privacy\u2019\nChoose \u2018View details & customise\u2019, then \u2018Communication & multiplayer\u2019\nOn the tab that says \u201cYou can play with people outside Xbox Live\u2019, choose \u2018Block\u2019\n\nSanta Sena Border Crossing places players on a highway packed with an unthinkable number of cars. Most maps feature a square or rectangle layout, but Santa Sena Border Crossing is a very narrow and linear map with little escape from the cars.\n\nSome players took to social media to call it the Picadilly of Modern Warfare 2, as Picadilly was a Modern Warfare 2019 map that also received a lot of talk and negative attention over its design.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD_PSTx7U_U", "date_published": "2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Outlast Trials' TERRIFYING Opening Gameplay", "description": "The closed beta for The Outlast Trials kicked off on Halloween weekend, and it is not for the faint of heart.
