## Modern Warfare 2’s Cross-Play Problem, Most Hated Map & More | GameSpot News

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC and Xbox doesn’t have a cross-play toggle, players don’t Santa Sena Border Crossing and Burger King and Activision team up for an exclusive skin. 
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

Games with cross-play support generally offer the ability to toggle it off, since some console players might not want to play with PC players using mouse and keyboard, while some PC players prefer not to play with console players that have aim-assist. For some unknown reason, this option in Modern Warfare 2 is only available to PS5 and PS4 players, meaning Xbox and PC players are stuck being lumped into cross-play lobbies unless developer Infinity Ward makes a change.

Xbox players do have the ability to circumvent this omission at a system level, toggling off support for cross-play that will apply to all games on the system. If you want to disable cross-play at a system level on Xbox, you can follow these steps:

Go to the Settings menu on the Xbox console
Go to the General tab and choose ‘Online safety & family’
Choose ‘Privacy & online safety’ then ‘Xbox Live privacy’
Choose ‘View details & customise’, then ‘Communication & multiplayer’
On the tab that says “You can play with people outside Xbox Live’, choose ‘Block’

Santa Sena Border Crossing places players on a highway packed with an unthinkable number of cars. Most maps feature a square or rectangle layout, but Santa Sena Border Crossing is a very narrow and linear map with little escape from the cars.

Some players took to social media to call it the Picadilly of Modern Warfare 2, as Picadilly was a Modern Warfare 2019 map that also received a lot of talk and negative attention over its design.
