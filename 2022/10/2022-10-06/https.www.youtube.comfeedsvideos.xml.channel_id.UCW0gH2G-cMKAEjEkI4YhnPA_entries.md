Deep dive into Rings of Power Episode 7: "The Eye" !  We'll look for all the references to Tolkien's deeper lore, explain what is happening, and I'll give some thoughts along the way. We had some confirmation on the nature of Mithril in the series and a huge name drop that has some crazy implications!
