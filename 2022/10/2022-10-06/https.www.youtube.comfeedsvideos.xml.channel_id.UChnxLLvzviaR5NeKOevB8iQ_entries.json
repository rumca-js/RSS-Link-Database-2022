Modular does the rest. Solo is done with a crazy setting on found on Rings that sounds nothing like Rings. Vocals were recorded and mixed after the modular performance in Ableton.\n\nCat was done in Facerig.\n------------------------------------\nPatreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nMy Music: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nMerch: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nConnect:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVOmsPvq6NY", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
