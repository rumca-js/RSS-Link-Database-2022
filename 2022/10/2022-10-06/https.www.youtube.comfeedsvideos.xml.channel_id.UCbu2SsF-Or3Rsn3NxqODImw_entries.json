For those of you still looking to order a Steam Deck, you\u2019re in luck because you no longer have to make a reservation or wait in a virtual line to buy one. Instead, you can buy it on demand--you know, the way you purchase everything else in your life\u2026 Well, except a PS5. Valve has also unveiled the device's promised docking station, which costs $89 and ships in 1-2 weeks. This premium accessory includes not only HDMI, Displayport, and 3 USB 3.1 connectors, but also an Ethernet port.\n\nIn a tweet announcing the Deck\u2019s new availability, Valve also noted a few nice features that were added in a recent update. These include expanded docking station options, simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboards, better trackpad typing, and improved stability in offline mode. It also includes several advanced control commands, including remapping certain commands when holding a button, as well as nested menus for more complicated PC games.\n\nBut even though the wait for more Steam Deck is over, the wait for Hideo Kojima\u2019s next game is still going. However it seems you won\u2019t have to wait much longer, as his studio Kojima Productions begins to pull the curtain back on its next project, revealing that the actress Elle Fanning will appear in it. Kojima revealed this as part of PAX Australia, which is going on now in Melbourne.\n\nThe first teaser for the mysterious game was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show last month. Additional teasers are coming, and if they follow tradition, a major game event might again be the host. If that's the case, the next big gaming event this year is Gamescom Asia at the end of October. After that, Kojima's pal Geoff Keighley is hosting The Game Awards in December.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Steam Deck\n01:10 - Hideo Kojima\n02:20 - Forza Horizon 5 Update", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU_VmmeJRF4", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mapping Out Cyberpunk Edgerunners.| Cyberpunk 2077", "description": "Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new hit Netflix anime based on CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077, isn't just set in Night City, but it just about every scene is actually a location from the game.

All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nBlizzard's long-awaited Overwatch 2 arrived this week, but the launch didn't exactly go to plan. Blizzard has apologized for the launch issues, saying it failed to meet the expectations of players and Blizzard itself. The studio also announced it is removing the phone registration requirement for many and provided an update on what's being done to mitigate server issues to help players get into matches.\n\nThe list of known issues for Overwatch 2 currently stands at nearly 15,000, but there are a few key issues that Blizzard wanted to address right now, the first of which is the phone number requirement. Blizzard initially said the phone number requirement was part of an effort to combat cheating, but many people complained about it for a variety of reasons, and some prepaid phone plans did not work.\n\nWhile most users will no longer require a phone number, accounts not connected to Battle.net and new accounts must still provide one.\n\nRegarding stability, Blizzard just recently released a patch for the login experience that has already been shown to increase the \"reliability\" of logging in. Blizzard is now working on another server update to help reduce how often players become disconnected when they can manage to connect to a game.\n\nPlayers have also reported that they are logging in to Overwatch 2 only to see that some or all of their items and data are missing. The good news is that no items or progress has been lost.\n\nBlizzard said this issue comes from players not completing their account merge process. Another factor is that items are taking time to populate from the original Overwatch to Overwatch 2. \"In all cases, no player data has been wiped or lost. We have a client-side fix for this that cannot be deployed until next week, so we are exploring server-side fixes and will provide updates as more information becomes available,\" Blizzard said.\n\nBlizzard went on to say that anyone who has unlocked a hero but that hero is still showing as locked should log back into the game, and this will resolve the issue \"in most cases.\" Players can open a support ticket if they are still experiencing problems.\n\nFinally, Blizzard said all of Overwatch 2's launch issues were exacerbated by the DDoS attacks against the game. \"They did not directly cause any of these issues, they made the environment in which we work on these issues more challenging. We have not suffered any further attacks,\" Blizzard said.\n\nBlizzard is not just the name of a massive video game developer, but also the name of a move in Pok\u00e9mon, which just revealed in a new trailer for the upcoming Scarlet and Violet titles that players that players will be able to craft their own TMs using resources dropped from Pokemon that have been caught or defeated in battle. \n\nThe Pokemon Company didn't go too deep into how many \"TMs\" can be crafted or how to unlock recipes, but from the video shown off, it looks like you can create TMs based on classic Pokemon abilities using League Points, berries, and other materials. The rest of the video showed off more of the customization that you'll be able to experiment with, Girafarig's new evolution that transforms it into Farigiraf, and a sandwich-making activity.\n\nCheck out the full 15 minute trailer here on GameSpot\u2019s YouTube.\n\nTIMECODES:\n00:16 - Blizzard Overwatch 2 Update\n02:47 - New Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet details\n03:44 - Need for Speed Unbound reveal", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHztrCPt4Ds", "date_published": "2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II | Official 4K Campaign Trailer", "description": "You are the company you keep strong and fight together in COD: Modern Warfare 2.
