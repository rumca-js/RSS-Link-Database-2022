The financial crash that has been predicted for the last few years has arrived. And it's not hard to see that the writing is on the wall when it comes to how bad things may get with this economic collapse... or at least, a major recession.

Over the last few weeks, US citizens have lost $9 trillion dollars in value from investments, pensions, and the like, due to the stock market absolutely tanking. In fact, it's been the single largest loss since the great recession caused by the 2008 housing collapse, and the second biggest loss since the Great Depression.

There's a lot to be concerned about. However, there's also the potential to prepare yourself for what's coming. And even possibly, to make a ton of money from the market going down, as many others have throughout history.

I'd love to hear your thoughts below.
