Did Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine? Was Shia Laboeuf fired? Did Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh get in a shouting match on set? Are Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde even still talking? Did Nick Kroll just kiss Harry Styles?! In the midst of all the chaos, it\u2019s been easy to forget that there\u2019s an actual movie surrounding the drama!\n\nDon\u2019t Worry Darling definitely raises some questions. Like what is going on, and will we get any answers for any of it? How does this simulation thing even work? How is Jack\u2019s simulation life any better than his previous life? How does this simulation not have any safeguards against escape? What was the point of the electroshock therapy if it doesn\u2019t even hold for five minutes? Did three cars just crash into each other in an open desert?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Don\u2019t Worry Darling! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Mandalorian Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQeT-vLiwE\n\nMorbius Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5I1WWeFQg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F0WzC9GWcI", "date_published": "2022-10-06 19:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
