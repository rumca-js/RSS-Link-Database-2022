Ahead of their show at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Australian punk-rock band Amyl and the Sniffers visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Mac Wilson. They played two songs from their latest album, 'Comfort to Me,' after starting with a cut from their 2019 self-titled release. After the music, the band spoke with Mac Wilson about how they spent their time during pandemic-related lockdowns, and the approach they take to keeping their sets lively and fresh every night.

Chicago band Dehd, on tour in support of their latest album, Blue Skies, visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Ayisha Jaffer. In addition to playing songs from the new record, Dehd’s Emily Kempf and Jason Balla took time to go deep on the songs’ meanings and the inspiration behind them. They also talk about how they helped bring live music to Chicagoans in a surprising way during the depths of the pandemic. And they also pull back the curtain on some stories their fans have shared on the band’s Hotline, a feature of their website.
