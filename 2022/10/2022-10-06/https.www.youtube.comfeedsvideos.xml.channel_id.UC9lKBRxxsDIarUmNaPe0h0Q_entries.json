And it's not hard to see that the writing is on the wall when it comes to how bad things may get with this economic collapse... or at least, a major recession.\n\nOver the last few weeks, US citizens have lost $9 trillion dollars in value from investments, pensions, and the like, due to the stock market absolutely tanking. In fact, it's been the single largest loss since the great recession caused by the 2008 housing collapse, and the second biggest loss since the Great Depression.\n\nThere's a lot to be concerned about. However, there's also the potential to prepare yourself for what's coming. And even possibly, to make a ton of money from the market going down, as many others have throughout history.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - A crazy few weeks in finance\n0:45 - The crash that's happening now\n3:12 - The second part of the drama: real estate\n5:15 - The first lesson: who to trust\n6:44 - Keeping crashes in perspective\n7:35 - Some final thoughts\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
