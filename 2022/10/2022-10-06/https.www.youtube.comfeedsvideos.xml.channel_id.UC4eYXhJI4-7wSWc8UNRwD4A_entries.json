I\u2019ve seen the Mexican singer-songwriter woo small audiences and large crowds with an elegance that\u2019s only grown since her first releases.That power to mesmerize is on full display during her time behind the desk with four songs that draw on the things that have earned Morrison stans all over Latin America.\n\nAfter the opening piano strains of \u201cContigo,\u201d we\u2019re treated to a display of how Morrison\u2019s lyrics can sometimes move the singer herself as she confesses to shedding a few tears during the chorus.\n\nThere is an underlying sense of purpose and release in this music as she explains why she took a break from her music career and how that influences the passion behind her latest album, El Renacimiento. \n\nIn fact, even as she introduces \u201cEncontrarme\u201d as an ode to self discovery and recovery, Morrison displays where the emotion in her lyrics come from as she tears up explaining the origin of the song.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so emotional,\u201d she says through tears, \u201cbecause it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been touring and I took a really long time to come back to myself and to be able to sing again. Just to be here means a lot to me because I do watch NPR Tiny Desk at home!\u201d\n \nAs if it couldn't get any more emotional, Morrison introduces \u201cTe Regalo\u201d by introducing the object of her melodic affections, her husband and co-producer, Alejandro Jim\u00e9nez. \n \nI\u2019m not saying you should have a box of tissues nearby while you watch Carla Morrison\u2019s performance, but it came in handy for me.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cContigo\u201d\n\u201cEncontrarme\u201d\n\u201cTe Regalo\u201d\n\u201cDisfruto\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarla Morrison: vocals\nAlejandro Jim\u00e9nez: guitar\nDaniel Fraire: keys\nSamuel Felix: drums\nEdgar Hernandez: bass\nDamaris Fraire: vocals\nSarai Pajon: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nAnimation: Alant\u00e9 Serene\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Anamaria Sayre, Fi O'Reilly\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#eltiny #tinydesk #carlamorrison", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWV7b3j5P0", "date_published": "2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
