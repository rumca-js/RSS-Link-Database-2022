Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! Sorry i am late on this one! I have been running around Japan making a video about the VR culture here! It's going to be amazing!! So many cool things to see and show; BUT this week of news is still fun and interesting. A Random Atari VR project pops up? Meta is in a media FRENZY- mostly negative as they get hit hard about "legs". In addition we have a lot of fun news regarding a new tiny VR headset and more! HOPE YOU ENJOY!!!
