Review of spikes in Neonatal Mortality ordered by Scotland

Healthcare Improvement Scotland, asked by Scottish Government

Review of significant increase in neonatal mortality

2021 to 2022

Scottish Government orders review as neonatal deaths higher than expected

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63097142

Neonatal death rates, two spikes over six-months

September 2021, at least 21 babies under 4 weeks died

March 2022, at least 18 babies under 4 weeks died

Average mortality rate among newborns

Two per 1,000 births.

In September 2021, 4.9 per 1,000 births

March 2020, 4.6 per 1,000 births

For all of 2021, 3.9 infant deaths for every thousand live births

For all of 2020, 3.1

(A preliminary investigation found the September spike was not linked to Covid)

This form of monitoring introduced, July 2017

I think the numbers are really troubling and I don't think we know the reasons why yet.

What we do know it's not neonatal Covid – the rates of Covid-19 infection in babies are very low and deaths from Covid are thankfully very, very small, 

so this isn't Covid affecting babies


Covid Scotland: Vaccines ruled out in neonatal deaths spike

https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/23028843.covid-scotland-vaccines-ruled-cause-neonatal-deaths-spike/?ref=rss

PUBLIC health experts ruled out any link between spikes in neonatal deaths and the Covid vaccine

without checking whether any of the infants' mothers had received the jag during pregnancy.

Experts stressed, no “plausible” link to justify investigating maternal vaccination status. 

Public Health Scotland (PHS) said its consultants had given “careful consideration” to the “potential benefits and harms” of carrying out such as analysis as part of its probe into the tragic deaths of 39 infants, 

but concluded against doing so

PHS added

A risk that “identifying the vaccination status of the mothers, even at aggregate level, 

would result in harm to those individuals and others close to them, 

through actual or perceived judgement of the effects of their personal vaccination decision”

Furthermore

“the outcomes of such analysis, whilst being uninformative for public health decision making, 

had the potential to be used to harm vaccine confidence at this critical time”

PHS response, “We do not have any plans to examine maternal vaccination status, as there is no public health reason to do so”.

NHS logging baby deaths as stillbirths ‘to avoid scrutiny’

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/10/16/nhs-logging-baby-deaths-stillbirths-avoid-scrutiny/

Families call into question trusts’ transparency after hospital accounts clash with their experience

NHS hospitals have claimed that babies born alive were stillborn

prompting accusations they were trying to avoid scrutiny.

Six children who died before they left hospital were wrongly described as stillborn. 

Several of the children lived for minutes and one lived for five days.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-powers-to-investigate-stillbirths

At present, coroners can only hold inquests for babies who have shown signs of life after being born.

The babies identified by The Telegraph should have been recorded as neonatal deaths, but staff claimed they were stillbirths

‘Our baby was alive for five days but was recorded as a stillbirth’

ONS vaccination data

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines

In the UK by the end of August 2022, of those aged 12 years and over: 

93.6% had received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine

88.2% had received a second dose 

70.2% had received three or more doses

Therefore 6.4% of over 12s are totally unvaccinated


Weekly national Influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report

Week 41 report (up to week 40 data) 13 October 2022 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1110820/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w41.pdf

(Page 74)

Cumulative data up to week 40 2022 (week ending 9 October 2022) was extracted from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). 

The vaccine uptake rate, aged 18 and over 

82.5% for dose 1

79.7% for dose 2

65.8% for dose 3

UK, HSA

Therefore 17.5% of over 18s are totally unvaccinated

UK, ONS

Therefore 6.4% of over 12s are totally unvaccinated

Given that vaccination rates are lower in 12 to 18, as compared to over 18s,

We would expect the percentage of unvaccinated in over 12s to be higher.

So his discrepancy is even greater that it appears

Vaccine rates are lower between 12 to 18

(compared to over 18s)

Implications of the Office for National Statistics estimates of Covid-19 vaccine take up in England on the representativeness of its sample population

(October 2022)

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364310694_Implications_of_the_Office_for_National_Statistics_estimates_of_Covid-19_vaccine_take_up_in_England_on_the_representativeness_of_its_sample_population?channel=doi&linkId=63459d419cb4fe44f31d90fd&showFulltext=true

Most recent vaccine mortality surveillance report the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS),

estimated just 8% of adults in England were unvaccinated by the end of May 2022. 

However, the ONS estimates are based on a special subset of the England population. 

Other independent estimates for the whole of the population in May were higher: 

the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) estimated 20%, 

while a large independent survey by ICM found 26%. 

https://www.icmunlimited.com/our-work/exploring-attitudes-towards-covid-19-vaccinations-for-stv/

Assuming the ONS estimate is correct for its subset of the England population,

and that the other independent estimates of between 20 and 26% for the whole population are also correct,

then between 69% and 99.6% of adults missing from the ONS sample are unvaccinated. 

This would mean the ONS sample is unrepresentative of the whole England population and any conclusions about vaccine take-up, 

efficacy and safety based on the ONS data may not be relevant to the population as a whole.

If the ONS is not underestimating the proportion of unvaccinated in its sample,

then we have shown that the sample is so unrepresentative of the whole population that any inferences made 
about the vaccination programme using the ONS data are worthless.
