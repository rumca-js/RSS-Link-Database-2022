We’ve got another update in the Microsoft & Activision Blizzard investigation as well as Silent Hill and Disney news.
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

The Competition and Markets Authority has so far expressed a number of concerns related to Microsoft and Activision Blizzard’s deal. One concern is how it has the potential to have a major impact on Sony if Activision Blizzard content is made exclusive to Xbox. 

In response to the CMA’s decision to enter a second phase of investigation into the proposed $69 billion deal, Microsoft highlighted footnote references to a tweet from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that said, "The agreement between Activision Blizzard and Sony includes restrictions on the ability of Activision Blizzard to place Call of Duty titles on Game Pass for a number of years.” 

After months of speculation and reports, Konami officially confirmed its Silent Hill 2 remake during the Silent Hill Transmission video presentation. The game, which opened the presentation with an impressive trailer, looks to be rebuilt from the ground up while still keeping the essence of the 2001 original intact.

The trailer gives us a look at the new James Sunderland, who has ventured to Silent Hill to rescue his wife Mary--long believed dead. We see some signature series elements in the trailer, as well, including the fog-filled streets and a few familiar enemies. Those, naturally, include Pyramid Head.

The Sunlit Plateau has fallen under darkness, and Scar--who wants to make that area his home--recruits the player to set things right. A new set of Star Path rewards are also available, which will let players earn Halloween-themed clothes and decorations to give their version of Dreamlight Valley a spooky spin.

The update also includes multiple bug fixes, from minor elements like Mickey's weird eyes and lightning flashes to game-breaking bugs. For example, memory pieces that would spawn inside the counter at Scrooge's store no longer do so, which allows players to finish questlines for multiple characters.

Activision has finally revealed more details about Modern Warfare 2’s Spec Ops mode.
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

Modern Warfare 2's Spec Ops mode is a 2-player co-op experience and at launch, Activision says it will initially feature three missions, meaning more missions could potentially arrive at a later date. These will be large-scale missions that take place in Al Mazrah, the new map location for Warzone 2.0.

In Spec Ops, players will have access to a backpack to store equipment and one of three Kits. Special Ops Kits are similar to having a set of perks, field upgrades, and killstreaks in multiplayer.

These Kits are leveled up by earning stars through missions and mission-related challenges, which the publisher says gives all three of these launch missions plenty of replayability.

Activision also mentioned that players will want to complete the Spec Ops missions and have at least one Kit leveled up to Rank 5 before Raids arrive post-launch on December 14 as part of the season 1 reloaded update. While it doesn't specify why, presumably this means kits will be factored into the Raids, which are described as being a direct continuation of the campaign. This new Raid feature will be introduced to Spec Ops sometime in Season 1.

Those with digital preorders of the game will receive early access to Modern Warfare 2's campaign, starting on October 20. Additionally, Activision announced a whole set of Modern Warfare 2 campaign rewards that players can earn for completing the campaign during the early-access period.
