Scottish Government\n\nReview of significant increase in neonatal mortality\n\n2021 to 2022\n\nScottish Government orders review as neonatal deaths higher than expected\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63097142\n\nNeonatal death rates, two spikes over six-months\n\nSeptember 2021, at least 21 babies under 4 weeks died\n\nMarch 2022, at least 18 babies under 4 weeks died\n\nAverage mortality rate among newborns\n\nTwo per 1,000 births.\n\nIn September 2021, 4.9 per 1,000 births\n\nMarch 2020, 4.6 per 1,000 births\n\nFor all of 2021, 3.9

think the numbers are really troubling and I don't think we know the reasons why yet.\n\nWhat we do know it's not neonatal Covid \u2013 the rates of Covid-19 infection in babies are very low and deaths from Covid are thankfully very, very small, \n\nso this isn't Covid affecting babies\n\n\nCovid Scotland: Vaccines ruled out in neonatal deaths spike\n\nhttps://www.heraldscotland.com/news/23028843.covid-scotland-vaccines-ruled-cause-neonatal-deaths-spike/?ref=rss\n\nPUBLIC health experts ruled out any link between spikes in neonatal deaths and the Covid vaccine\n\nwithout checking whether any of the infants' mothers had received the jag during pregnancy.\n\nExperts stressed, no \u201cplausible\u201d link to justify investigating maternal vaccination status. \n\nPublic Health Scotland (PHS) said its consultants had given \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to the \u201cpotential benefits and harms\u201d of carrying out such as analysis as part of its probe into the tragic deaths of 39 infants, \n\nbut concluded against doing so\n\nPHS added\n\nA risk that \u201cidentifying the vaccination status of the mothers, even at aggregate level, \n\nwould result in harm to those individuals and others close to them, \n\nthrough actual or perceived judgement of the effects of their personal vaccination decision\u201d\n\nFurthermore\n\n\u201cthe outcomes of such analysis, whilst being uninformative for public health decision making, \n\nhad the potential to be used to harm vaccine confidence at this critical time\u201d\n\nPHS response, \u201cWe do not have any plans to examine maternal vaccination status, as there is no public health reason to do so\u201d.\n\nNHS logging baby deaths as

days.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-powers-to-investigate-stillbirths\n\nAt present, coroners can only hold inquests for babies who have shown signs of life after being born.\n\nThe babies

2022)\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/364310694_Implications_of_the_Office_for_National_Statistics_estimates_of_Covid-19_vaccine_take_up_in_England_on_the_representativeness_of_its_sample_population?channel=doi&linkId=63459d419cb4fe44f31d90fd&showFulltext=true\n\nMost recent vaccine mortality surveillance report the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS),\n\nestimated just 8% of adults in England were unvaccinated by the end of May 2022. \n\nHowever, the ONS estimates are based on a special subset of the England population. \n\nOther independent estimates for the whole of the population in May were higher: \n\nthe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) estimated 20%, \n\nwhile a large independent survey by ICM found 26%. \n\nhttps://www.icmunlimited.com/our-work/exploring-attitudes-towards-covid-19-vaccinations-for-stv/\n\nAssuming the ONS estimate is correct for its subset of the England population,\n\nand that the other independent estimates of between 20 and 26% for the whole population are also correct,\n\nthen between 69% and 99.6% of adults missing from the ONS sample are unvaccinated. \n\nThis would mean the ONS sample is unrepresentative of the whole England population and any conclusions about vaccine take-up, \n\nefficacy and safety based on the ONS data may not be relevant to the population as a whole.\n\nIf the ONS is not underestimating the proportion of unvaccinated in its sample,\n\nthen we have shown that the sample is so unrepresentative of the whole population that any inferences made \nabout the vaccination programme using the ONS data are worthless.\n\n\nYT Guidelines\n\nCOVID-19 medical misinformation
