Thanks to ORIGIN PC for sponsoring this video! Check out their new EVO 15-S system at: https://bit.ly/LTT_EVO15S

The team at LMG are a diverse bunch with a wide-ranging skillset - and they often use those skills to cast a critical eye on the choices Linus makes with his setups. Today though, we play the uno reverse card: it’s time for Linus and Luke to judge the choices their own staff make, and publicly roast their setups!

Plouffe was voluntold to daily drive the Azeron Cyborg for at least a MONTH. It definitely has a wide range of benefits, but do they outweigh the cons and annoyances? Is this the controller or gamepad replacement you've been looking for?
