In her new Twitter thread, Taylor said she was initially offered $10,000 total to play Bayonetta in the third game, but she deemed it to be too low and wrote a letter to Bayonetta 3 director Hideki Kamiya asking him to pay her what she was worth.\nTaylor said, \"I thought that as a creative, he would understand. He replied saying how much he valued my contribution to the game and how much the fans wanted me to voice the game.\u201d She added that Platinum Games offered her an additional $5,000 for a total of $15,000, but she declined the offer. Taylor then explained, \u201cI heard nothing from them for 11 months. They then offered me a flat fee to voice some lines for 4,000 dollars.\u201d\nAnother major release coming out soon is God of War Ragnarok. Unfortunately for fans who wanted to go into the experience with fresh eyes, the game is leaking ahead of time.
