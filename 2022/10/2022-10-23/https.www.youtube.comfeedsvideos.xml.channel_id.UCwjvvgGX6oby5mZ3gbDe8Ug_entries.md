This is in southern China, where a flyover under construction suddenly collapsed. 

In the past, when Red China was apparently rich, the only noticeable thing was the shocking corruption; now that the economy is slowly crumbling, the risk of such tofu-dreg projects has grown significantly. When there was plenty of money, there existed a high number of tofu-dreg projects, how can we expect the quality of the projects to be guaranteed when the money is close to drying up? 

Tofu-dreg construction is the predecessor of rotten-tail buildings. When many tofu-dreg projects appeared in the last few years, it already foretold the emergence of the future storm of rotten-tail buildings. If developers can deliver tofu-dreg projects to home buyers, they won't let themselves get to the point where their developments are falling apart.
