Do I need optimizers or microinverters for my PV system? Solar Edge and Enphase, the two most prominent companies in this field, say “yes” and sell many of these little devices. They also explain why they are absolutely needed. But is this true, or are these optimizers only needed to fill the pockets of the manufacturers? Let’s do some tests, compare it with my Huawei Sun2000 string inverter, and learn about modern solar panels.
