#GamingNews #Bayonetta3 #Reaction

Voice actor Hellena Taylor originally said she was offered $4,000 to appear as the voice of Bayonetta in Bayonetta 3, a figure she said was "insulting." Hellena was later replaced by veteran voice actor Jennifer Hale and Platinum Games put out a statement in support of Hale, who received a wave of criticism and backlash. 
After Taylor's claims went viral, Bloomberg published a report that said she was offered around $15,000, a figure Taylor has since confirmed to be accurate. In her new Twitter thread, Taylor said she was initially offered $10,000 total to play Bayonetta in the third game, but she deemed it to be too low and wrote a letter to Bayonetta 3 director Hideki Kamiya asking him to pay her what she was worth.
Taylor said, "I thought that as a creative, he would understand. He replied saying how much he valued my contribution to the game and how much the fans wanted me to voice the game.” She added that Platinum Games offered her an additional $5,000 for a total of $15,000, but she declined the offer. Taylor then explained, “I heard nothing from them for 11 months. They then offered me a flat fee to voice some lines for 4,000 dollars.”
Another major release coming out soon is God of War Ragnarok. Unfortunately for fans who wanted to go into the experience with fresh eyes, the game is leaking ahead of time. A Twitter account is posting screenshots of the game that contain spoilers, according to VGC, which has seen the account.

God of War Ragnarök will soon give us the showdown to end all showdowns: the Norse Gods will finally face their final battle, with Kratos and Atreus in the mix for good measure. 

The god of thunder himself, Thor, is one of the major players in Norse mythology, and will butt heads with Kratos in Sony Santa Monica’s latest. So, let’s become the Gods of Lore as we take a look at how Thor initially appeared in Norse Mythology, discuss how that compares to what we already know about the thunder god in the game, and what that might mean for his ultimate fate as the end times, Ragnarok itself, thunders closer.

Ever since the release of Layers of Fear, Bloober's games have been obsessed with getting you inside the damaged minds of their characters–sometimes literally. However, their games have also attracted criticism for their sometimes troubling messaging around trauma and mental health.

We spoke to Mateusz Lenart, Lead Director of the upcoming Silent Hill 2 Remake, about the origins of Layers of Fear, Bloober's horror philosophy, and how they hope to make psychological horror games that get inside the player's head too.
