Chicago band Dehd, on tour in support of their latest album, Blue Skies, visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Ayisha Jaffer. During the interview, Dehd’s Emily Kempf and Jason Balla took time to go deep on the songs’ meanings and the inspiration behind them. They also talk about how they helped bring live music to Chicagoans in a surprising way during the depths of the pandemic. And they also pull back the curtain on some stories their fans have shared on the band’s Hotline, a feature of their website.
