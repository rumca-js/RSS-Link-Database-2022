Activision has finally revealed more details about Modern Warfare 2’s Spec Ops mode.
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

Modern Warfare 2's Spec Ops mode is a 2-player co-op experience and at launch, Activision says it will initially feature three missions, meaning more missions could potentially arrive at a later date. These will be large-scale missions that take place in Al Mazrah, the new map location for Warzone 2.0.

In Spec Ops, players will have access to a backpack to store equipment and one of three Kits. Special Ops Kits are similar to having a set of perks, field upgrades, and killstreaks in multiplayer.

These Kits are leveled up by earning stars through missions and mission-related challenges, which the publisher says gives all three of these launch missions plenty of replayability.

Activision also mentioned that players will want to complete the Spec Ops missions and have at least one Kit leveled up to Rank 5 before Raids arrive post-launch on December 14 as part of the season 1 reloaded update. While it doesn't specify why, presumably this means kits will be factored into the Raids, which are described as being a direct continuation of the campaign. This new Raid feature will be introduced to Spec Ops sometime in Season 1.

Those with digital preorders of the game will receive early access to Modern Warfare 2's campaign, starting on October 20. Additionally, Activision announced a whole set of Modern Warfare 2 campaign rewards that players can earn for completing the campaign during the early-access period.

## A Plague Tale: Requiem Review

A Plague Tale: Requiem eventually expands in scope and improves upon its predecessor's stealth action, but the heartrending story of two siblings battling against the odds is where it truly excels.
#Gaming #APlagueTaleRequiem #Game

A Plague Tale: Requiem excels in the same areas its predecessor did. Its stealth-action gameplay is uneven but has at least improved, introducing more tools for you to play around with and expanding in scope to provide more interesting avenues to explore when it comes to traversing past threats both human and rodent alike. The rats are still its most memorable feature, bursting from the floor like geysers and in more numbers than ever before. There's a lot to love in Requiem, even if frustration is an all-too-common bedfellow when it comes to gameplay. There are better stealth games out there, but its unique setting, poignant storytelling, and rat-infested dread make 14th-century France worth returning to.

Amicia and Hugo's characterization is at the heart of Requiem's story and propels the narrative forward even when it occasionally stumbles. The performances across the board are excellent, and I appreciate its authentic portrayal of anxiety and panic attacks as the consequences of their traumatic experiences finally catch up with Amicia. It can seem cruel at times, but Requiem tells a heartrending and powerful tale that's worth seeing through to the end.

Modern Warfare 2 has made an important change to its third-person mode and Silent Hill are teasing the future of the series.
#GamingNews #ModernWarfare2 #SilentHill

The post revealed some top tips for playing Modern Warfare 2 and confirmed that a post-beta update to third-person mode will require that only scopes over 4x zoom will activate first person ADS.

This change is a significant upgrade over the beta version of the mode, as no matter which optic was used, aiming down sights would automatically switch the view to first person-mode. This constant switching was a bit jarring and the only way to avoid the view change was to hip-fire weapons. Now, players will be able to aim with a traditional third-person style, with first-person view only necessary when using a scope with a magnification of 4x or more.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28 across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Those with digital preorders of the game will receive early access to Modern Warfare 2's campaign, starting sometime on October 20.
