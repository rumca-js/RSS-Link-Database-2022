Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. \n \nMohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master\u2019s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master\u2019s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master\u2019s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as \u201cThe Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.\u201d\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n \n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Mohammed Hijab:\n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDFNoOk8WOXtHo8DIc8efQ \n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/mohammedhijabofficial/?hl=en \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/mohammed_hijab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\nWebsite - www.mohammedhijab.com\n\nThe Sapience Institute - https://sapienceinstitute.org/\n\n\nFor Jonathan Pageau:\n\nCarvings - http://www.pageaucarvings.com \n\nWebsite - www.thesymbolicworld.com \n\nOrthodox Arts Journal - www.orthodoxartsjournal.org \n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/jonathanpageau \n\n- Sponsor - \n\nGet pre-qualified and find the best deals near you: https://carzing.com/jordan \n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:12) Intro\n(4:16) Addressing \u201cMessage to Muslims\u201d\n(14:35) Colonial amnesia and the pattern of resentment\n(15:19) Egyptian mythology and the bloodshed of the past\n(21:49) Ignoring the voices of disunity\n(27:53) Is there an ultimate purpose to life?\n(35:42) The role of worship and ritual\n(39:52) Unity is not the same as uniformity\n(43:20) Belief at your own peril, deviation, and depression\n(50:55) Islam recognizes Jesus, but not the son of god\n(59:16) We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know\n(1:08:40) Belief in word vs. belief in being\n(1:10:17) Why do we connect with specific scripture?\n(1:23:25) You are measured by how much you can endure\n(1:26:01) Would Jordan Peterson consider becoming Muslim?\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL // \nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.co... \nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate \n\n// COURSES // \nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality \nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com \nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com \n\n// BOOKS // \nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order \n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-... \nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m... \n\n// LINKS // \nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com \nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events \nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog \nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast \n\n// SOCIAL // \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson \nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson \nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #MohammedHijab #JonathanPageau #pageau #islam #muslim #religion", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "title": "Jordan B Peterson"}}
