These will be large-scale missions that take place in Al Mazrah, the new map location for Warzone 2.0.\n\nIn Spec Ops, players will have access to a backpack to store equipment and one of three Kits. Special Ops Kits are similar to having a set of perks, field upgrades, and killstreaks in multiplayer.\n\nThese Kits are leveled up by earning stars through missions and mission-related challenges, which the publisher says gives all three of these launch missions plenty of replayability.\n\nActivision also mentioned that players will want to complete the Spec Ops missions and have at least one Kit leveled up to Rank 5 before Raids arrive post-launch on December 14 as part of the season 1 reloaded update. While it doesn't specify why, presumably this means kits will be factored into the Raids, which are described as being a direct continuation of the campaign. This new Raid feature will be introduced to Spec Ops sometime in Season 1.\n\nThose with digital preorders of the game will receive early access to Modern Warfare 2's campaign, starting on October 20. Additionally, Activision announced a whole set of Modern Warfare 2 campaign rewards that players can earn for completing the campaign during the early-access period.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSh8HpgIrIQ", "date_published": "2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Need for Speed Unbound Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "To get to the top in Need for Speed Unbound, you need to take risks.

Its stealth-action gameplay is uneven but has at least improved, introducing more tools for you to play around with and expanding in scope to provide more interesting avenues to explore when it comes to traversing past threats both human and rodent alike. The rats are still its most memorable feature, bursting from the floor like geysers and in more numbers than ever before. There's a lot to love in Requiem, even if frustration is an all-too-common bedfellow when it comes to gameplay. There are better stealth games out there, but its unique setting, poignant storytelling, and rat-infested dread make 14th-century France worth returning to.\n\nAmicia and Hugo's characterization is at the heart of Requiem's story and propels the narrative forward even when it occasionally stumbles. The performances across the board are excellent, and I appreciate its authentic portrayal of anxiety and panic attacks as the consequences of their traumatic experiences finally catch up with Amicia. It can seem cruel at times, but Requiem tells a heartrending and powerful tale that's worth seeing through to the end.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKZFK4_Qaf4", "date_published": "2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends | Stories from the Outlands: Last Hope - Official Cinematic Trailer", "description": "The shattered moon of Boreas needs help.
