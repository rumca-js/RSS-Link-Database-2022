Side effects may include an intense head bop, the occasional stank face and a mean two-step. Wrice\u2019s Tiny Desk concert is a stunning display of her talents, showing us where the San Diego bred, Los Angeles based singer has been and where she\u2019s going next. Clad in all white and backed by a band wearing matching black Nike tracksuits and sneakers, they exude a vibe reminiscent of a family.\n\nThe concert commences with a sampling of her refreshing (and NPR favorite) 2021 debut album Overgrown, that established her as a major voice in contemporary R&B. Accompanied by a six-piece band of tasteful musicians, Wrice opens with a soulful live arrangement of \u201cChandler,\u201d before smoothly transitioning into \u201cFalling In Love.\u201d That funky bassline you hear? Courtesy of the one and only Dernst \u201cD'Mile\u201d Emile II, who executive produced Overgrown and last graced the Tiny Desk for Lucky Daye\u2019s concert in 2019.\n\nWe get a taste of Wrice\u2019s new pop influenced EP Motive, which takes an energetic turn away from her more soulful debut. As she closes out the set with \u201cBittersweet Goodbyes,\u201d and the Kaytranada produced \u201cIced Tea,\u201d both written in collaboration with Mack Keane (who\u2019s seen here holding it down on keys), we witness an assured artist motivated to make you move.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cChandler\u201d\n\u201cFalling in Love\u201d\n\u201cMust Be Nice\u201d\n\u201cOn One\u201d\n\u201cBittersweet Goodbyes\u201d\n\u201cIced Tea\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJoyce Wrice: vocals\nDernst \u201cD\u2019Mile\u201d Emile II: bass\nBranden Akinyele: drums \nMack Keane: keys, vocals \nChristian Carey: guitar\nD'anna Stewart: vocals\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #JoyceWrice", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dd7WejIFi8", "date_published": "2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
