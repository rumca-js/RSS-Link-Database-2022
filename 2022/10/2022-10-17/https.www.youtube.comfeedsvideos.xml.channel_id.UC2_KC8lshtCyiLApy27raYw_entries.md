Google Stadia was a cloud streaming gaming platform that existed for some time. Not a long time, but some.

Its failure doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot, except raising the possibility that big tech may be incapable of breaking into the traditional gaming industry.

There’s a lot of reasons many people assumed this was Stadia’s fate, and I kinda just wanted to talk about that this week.

Maybe they should’ve bought GTA.
