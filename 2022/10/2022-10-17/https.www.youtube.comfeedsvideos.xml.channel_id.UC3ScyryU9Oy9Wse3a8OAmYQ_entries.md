Michael Flynn spent decades fighting wars overseas, from Central America to Iraq to Afghanistan. Now, the retired three-star general is fighting a war at home, the new documentary “Michael Flynn's Holy War” reports.

FRONTLINE and The @AssociatedPress trace that transformation, showing how Flynn has become a leader in a political movement that’s attracting election deniers, conspiracy theorists and extremists from around the country.

“Michael Flynn's Holy War” examines the movement’s volatile mix of politics and conspiracy theories — and its efforts to put its brand of Christianity at the center of American civic life and institutions. As the above excerpt shows, this ideology — known as Christian nationalism — was on display at the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, where camouflage and tactical gear mingled with Christian imagery.

In the run-up to the midterm elections, "Michael Flynn’s Holy War" is a revealing look at the rise of one of the Republican party’s most active and polarizing political allies, and what his growing influence might mean for future U.S. elections.

"Michael Flynn’s Holy War" will be available to stream in full starting Oct. 18, 2022. https://to.pbs.org/3D6cQqc
