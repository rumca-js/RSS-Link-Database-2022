Its stealth-action gameplay is uneven but has at least improved, introducing more tools for you to play around with and expanding in scope to provide more interesting avenues to explore when it comes to traversing past threats both human and rodent alike. The rats are still its most memorable feature, bursting from the floor like geysers and in more numbers than ever before. There's a lot to love in Requiem, even if frustration is an all-too-common bedfellow when it comes to gameplay. There are better stealth games out there, but its unique setting, poignant storytelling, and rat-infested dread make 14th-century France worth returning to.\n\nAmicia and Hugo's characterization is at the heart of Requiem's story and propels the narrative forward even when it occasionally stumbles. The performances across the board are excellent, and I appreciate its authentic portrayal of anxiety and panic attacks as the consequences of their traumatic experiences finally catch up with Amicia. It can seem cruel at times, but Requiem tells a heartrending and powerful tale that's worth seeing through to the end.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKZFK4_Qaf4", "date_published": "2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends | Stories from the Outlands: Last Hope - Official Cinematic Trailer", "description": "The shattered moon of Boreas needs help.

This constant switching was a bit jarring and the only way to avoid the view change was to hip-fire weapons. Now, players will be able to aim with a traditional third-person style, with first-person view only necessary when using a scope with a magnification of 4x or more.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28 across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
