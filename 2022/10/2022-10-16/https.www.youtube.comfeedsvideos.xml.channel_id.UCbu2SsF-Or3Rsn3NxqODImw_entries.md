A Plague Tale: Requiem eventually expands in scope and improves upon its predecessor's stealth action, but the heartrending story of two siblings battling against the odds is where it truly excels.

A Plague Tale: Requiem excels in the same areas its predecessor did. Its stealth-action gameplay is uneven but has at least improved, introducing more tools for you to play around with and expanding in scope to provide more interesting avenues to explore when it comes to traversing past threats both human and rodent alike. The rats are still its most memorable feature, bursting from the floor like geysers and in more numbers than ever before. There's a lot to love in Requiem, even if frustration is an all-too-common bedfellow when it comes to gameplay. There are better stealth games out there, but its unique setting, poignant storytelling, and rat-infested dread make 14th-century France worth returning to.

Amicia and Hugo's characterization is at the heart of Requiem's story and propels the narrative forward even when it occasionally stumbles. The performances across the board are excellent, and I appreciate its authentic portrayal of anxiety and panic attacks as the consequences of their traumatic experiences finally catch up with Amicia. It can seem cruel at times, but Requiem tells a heartrending and powerful tale that's worth seeing through to the end.

Modern Warfare 2 has made an important change to its third-person mode and Silent Hill are teasing the future of the series.

The post revealed some top tips for playing Modern Warfare 2 and confirmed that a post-beta update to third-person mode will require that only scopes over 4x zoom will activate first person ADS.

This change is a significant upgrade over the beta version of the mode, as no matter which optic was used, aiming down sights would automatically switch the view to first person-mode. This constant switching was a bit jarring and the only way to avoid the view change was to hip-fire weapons. Now, players will be able to aim with a traditional third-person style, with first-person view only necessary when using a scope with a magnification of 4x or more.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28 across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Those with digital preorders of the game will receive early access to Modern Warfare 2's campaign, starting sometime on October 20.

Ragnarök is soon upon us, specifically God of War Ragnarök, so we’re taking a look at the central figures of the game and looking at their actual story in Norse myth, how it is similar or different to what we’ve already seen in God of War, and what it might mean for Kratos’s ultimate fate. And today, we’re starting with a crowd favorite; Loki.

As a multiplayer horror title, Dead By Daylight relies on something unique to keep the game scary years after release--the unpredictable chaos of human nature.

We sat down with Dave Richard, Creative Director of Dead By Daylight, to discuss the psychology behind its twisted game of hide-and-seek, and how Behaviour Interactive hope to maintain the fear factor across thousands of matches.
