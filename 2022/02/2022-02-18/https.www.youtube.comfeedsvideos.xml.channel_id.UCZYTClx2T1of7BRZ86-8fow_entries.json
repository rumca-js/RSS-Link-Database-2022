Linode offers simple, affordable, and accessible Linux cloud solutions and services.\n\nScientists working at a nuclear fusion facility in Oxford announced a record-breaking result. And while there's still a lot to figure out to make fusion viable, this brings us one step closer to realizing a technology with huge potential for clean energy.\n\nCorrection: \n3:45 Here we said, \u201cIn this experiment, JET ran for five seconds before its magnets got too hot. We use time to measure energy output, so running the numbers we get 11 megawatts of energy. Now, that\u2019s honestly not a ton. About the same as the energy a household uses in a day.\u201d When we should have used a measurement of energy and not power. So the generator made ~16.4 kWh or about 55% of what a U.S household uses per day.\n\nHosted by: Hank Green\n\nSciShow is on TikTok!
