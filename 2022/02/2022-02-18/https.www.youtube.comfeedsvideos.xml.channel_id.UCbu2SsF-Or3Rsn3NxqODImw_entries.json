There\u2019s mention of a Nazi treasure map and another character simply called Roman - both of which are pretty solid references to the very first game in the franchise, Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune. \n\nIn that game, Nate, Sully and Elena Fisher - Nate\u2019s future wife - search for the lost treasure of El Dorado, and encounter - among other things - a Nazi U-boat in the jungle, as well as a German U-boat station in a race against rival treasure hunter, Gabriel Roman - potentially the Roman who\u2019s namechecked in this scene.\n\nThe Complete Uncharted Timeline Explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xHZFaybvZE&t=1s", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3wpmFERaSQ", "date_published": "2022-02-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elden Ring Size & Preload Details | GameSpot News", "description": "Elden Ring file size and preloading are confirmed on Xbox consoles, Activision gives an update on Call of Duty anti-cheat, and EA responds to reports that Halo Infinite hurt Battlefield 2042.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about Elden Ring\u2019s file size and preloading, which is currently live for Xbox players.

It also features another round of bug fixes. While the game still isn't perfect, the game's current state feels more than acceptable, and we feel confident in saying that Cyberpunk is finally in a good playable state for players to enjoy. Patch 1.5 also features some more dramatic gameplay changes like new skills, a rebalanced economy, the option to change your appearance after the start, and even new apartments for V to rent. Only time will tell where Cyberpunk will go from here but for now it's nice to just sit back and experience the game for what it is.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:02 - PlayStation 5 Version\n05:38 - PC Version\n06:39 - Quality of Life Improvements\n09:27 - Are There Still Bugs?\n10:24 - Skills & Apartments\n11:19 - What's The Future For Cyberpunk?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eeZiVJP33k", "date_published": "2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rainbow Six Extraction - Spillover Crisis Event Gameplay", "description": "Rainbow Six Extraction is having it's first post-launch, limited time event- Spillover.
