Uncharted is an iconic franchise, a game that is firmly cemented to a whole family of consoles and a series that helped shape a studio’s development and storytelling, but our Dave Jewitt has never played it!
Does the game stand the test of time? Is it worth exploiting for new players? Do enemies ever run out of grenades? Dave has to answer all these questions and more.

While the Uncharted movie largely charts its own path with an original story different to Naughty Dog’s game series, there are a handful of easter eggs and game references for eagle-eyed fans to keep a lookout for. And not only that, but it ends with a post-credits sting that teases a sequel that might actually follow the games a lot more closely.

In the post-credits scene we see Nathan Drake and Sully meet with a shady-looking, eyepatch-sporting Pilou Asbaek, and they’re discussing their potential next big job, which Sully says could be the big one. There’s mention of a Nazi treasure map and another character simply called Roman - both of which are pretty solid references to the very first game in the franchise, Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 

In that game, Nate, Sully and Elena Fisher - Nate’s future wife - search for the lost treasure of El Dorado, and encounter - among other things - a Nazi U-boat in the jungle, as well as a German U-boat station in a race against rival treasure hunter, Gabriel Roman - potentially the Roman who’s namechecked in this scene.

Elden Ring file size and preloading are confirmed on Xbox consoles, Activision gives an update on Call of Duty anti-cheat, and EA responds to reports that Halo Infinite hurt Battlefield 2042. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Elden Ring’s file size and preloading, which is currently live for Xbox players. A preload date hasn't been announced yet for PlayStation consoles or PC. Elden Ring releases on February 25, 2022 for PlayStation, Xbox and PC. 

DeVante also talks about reports that said the launch of Halo Infinite might have contributed to the lower-than-expected results. Fans may recall that Microsoft surprise-launched Halo Infinite's multiplayer on November 15, just days before Battlefield 2042. 

Later in the video, he explains a new blog post from Activision that said cheating within Warzone reached an "all-time low" during the holidays, speaking to the success of the Ricochet tools.

## Is Cyberpunk 2077 Finally In The State It Should Be?

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with patch 1.5. Lucy and Jean-Luc dive into if the game is finally in the bug-free and fully playable state it should have been at launch, as well as touch on added features like new apartments and weapons.

The next-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077 come with both a performance and ray tracing mode, giving players the option for 60fps or 30fps with ray-traced shadows. It also features another round of bug fixes. While the game still isn't perfect, the game's current state feels more than acceptable, and we feel confident in saying that Cyberpunk is finally in a good playable state for players to enjoy. Patch 1.5 also features some more dramatic gameplay changes like new skills, a rebalanced economy, the option to change your appearance after the start, and even new apartments for V to rent. Only time will tell where Cyberpunk will go from here but for now it's nice to just sit back and experience the game for what it is.
