What happens if China invades Taiwan? Here’s how the start of World War 3 might go down.

For this video I leaned on some excellent interviews and research form:
Oriana Skylar Mastro: https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/oriana-skylar-mastro
Michael O’Hanlon: https://www.brookings.edu/experts/michael-e-ohanlon/

Also, Reuters did a similar speculative piece using some really compelling visuals: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/taiwan-china-wargames/

Ian Easton’s research using PLA internal documents was a strong foundation for my reporting on this: https://project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chinas-Top-Five-War-Plans_Ian_Easton_Project2049.pdf
