We set the game to medium graphic settings and get a solid performance outside of the occasional frame hitching, although that issue seems to be PC wide and not Steam deck Specific.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Steam Deck, check out our full review from Alessandro Barbosa who said, \"The Steam Deck is a wonderfully constructed and powerful portable PC that can, in the right hands, be a lot more than what Valve envisions with SteamOS, given your patience to work with Linux or replace it entirely.\"\n\nIf you want to know more about Elden Ring, check out Tamoor Hussain's review in progress.

It is already February 25 in some parts of the world, and some gamers have found that changing your Xbox region to, say, New Zealand or Australia, will allow you to start playing Elden Ring right now. This also requires a digital copy of the game and could get you banned, so try this at your own risk.\n\nAnd before you start up Elden Ring for the first time you'll need to download a day-one patch. The patch promises some fixes to various bugs and slight tweaks to elements like player controls and game balance.\n\nSome of the other fixes mentioned were various text and balance adjustments, NPC event fixes, and more. We\u2019ve got the full list for the day one patch on gamespot.com.\n\nMarch 2022's reported Games With Gold lineup includes the post-societal adventure game The Flame in the Flood, the action-based soccer game Street Power Soccer, and the RPG Sacred 2: Fallen Angel. SpongeBob's Truth or Square, which has players using Plankton's memory machine to find the formula to the Krabby Patty secret formula, is also included in March with Games With Gold.\n\n#EldenRing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saJh-jaiZoM", "date_published": "2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Steam Deck Review", "description": "The Steam Deck delivers on its promise of high-performance mobile gaming with impressive game performance and an intelligent hardware design.\n\nWith cutting-edge hardware, thoughtfully designed ergonomics, a satisfying controller layout, and a software layer that simplifies PC gaming, the Steam Deck makes it a breeze to link to your Steam account and get started with your library on the go. Better yet, it comes in at a reasonable price, starting at $400 and reaching only $650 for its highest-tier model--essentially half the price of its closest competitors. While that alone is impressive, it's in how well the Steam Deck performs that it becomes clear that it doesn't have much competition at all. With its AMD Zen 2 and RDNA 2 APU, it's head-and-shoulders above the Intel XE and Radeon Vega-powered portable gaming devices that made it to market first, creating a situation where you shouldn't really be looking at an alternative if you can get your hands on a Steam Deck.\u00a0\n\nThe Steam Deck is now available  You can read the full written Steam Deck review by Alessandro Barbosa on GameSpot.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wcZqSXKnAo", "date_published": "2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
