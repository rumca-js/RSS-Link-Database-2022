How does FromSoftware's latest run on Valve's new portable PC? Take a look for yourself!

Elden Ring and Steam Deck share a launch date, so of course we had to know how the game looks and runs on the system. We set the game to medium graphic settings and get a solid performance outside of the occasional frame hitching, although that issue seems to be PC wide and not Steam deck Specific.

If you want to know more about the Steam Deck, check out our full review from Alessandro Barbosa who said, "The Steam Deck is a wonderfully constructed and powerful portable PC that can, in the right hands, be a lot more than what Valve envisions with SteamOS, given your patience to work with Linux or replace it entirely."

If you want to know more about Elden Ring, check out Tamoor Hussain's review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, "From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience."

## Elden Ring PS5 Saves Being Lost | GameSpot News

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Elden Ring losing PS5 saves, Steam Deck 2 already being discussed, and more.

In a message posted February 25, Bandai Namco said there were several "main items to be revised" in Elden Ring, primarily in the PC version, including an issue with the mouse sensitivity being too high, frame rate issues, and more.

On PS5, save data can be lost if the PS5 shuts off before closing the game--either when it was fully powered or in rest mode--so if you were using rest mode as an artificial pause button, you may want to reconsider.

If you were among the first batch of people to reserve a Steam Deck last year, make sure you're checking your inbox. Emails began going out at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Once it arrives, you'll be able to make your final payment, confirm your shipping details, and (barring any delays) likely get your hands on Steam Deck next week. Despite the Steam Deck not quite out yet, there are reportedly already discussions of a Steam Deck 2.

For all of the Deep Rock Galactic fans out there, the game is celebrating it’s 4 year anniversary with a big in-game event and livestream.

## Play Elden Ring Early On Xbox… At Your Own Risk | GameSpot News

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about a way to play Elden Ring early on Xbox, Elden Ring’s day one patch, and more.

From Software's hugely anticipated RPG Elden Ring launches tomorrow, but you may not need to wait until then to start playing. It is already February 25 in some parts of the world, and some gamers have found that changing your Xbox region to, say, New Zealand or Australia, will allow you to start playing Elden Ring right now. This also requires a digital copy of the game and could get you banned, so try this at your own risk.

And before you start up Elden Ring for the first time you'll need to download a day-one patch. The patch promises some fixes to various bugs and slight tweaks to elements like player controls and game balance.

Some of the other fixes mentioned were various text and balance adjustments, NPC event fixes, and more. We’ve got the full list for the day one patch on gamespot.com.

March 2022's reported Games With Gold lineup includes the post-societal adventure game The Flame in the Flood, the action-based soccer game Street Power Soccer, and the RPG Sacred 2: Fallen Angel. SpongeBob's Truth or Square, which has players using Plankton's memory machine to find the formula to the Krabby Patty secret formula, is also included in March with Games With Gold.

## Steam Deck Review

The Steam Deck delivers on its promise of high-performance mobile gaming with impressive game performance and an intelligent hardware design.

With cutting-edge hardware, thoughtfully designed ergonomics, a satisfying controller layout, and a software layer that simplifies PC gaming, the Steam Deck makes it a breeze to link to your Steam account and get started with your library on the go. Better yet, it comes in at a reasonable price, starting at $400 and reaching only $650 for its highest-tier model--essentially half the price of its closest competitors. While that alone is impressive, it's in how well the Steam Deck performs that it becomes clear that it doesn't have much competition at all. With its AMD Zen 2 and RDNA 2 APU, it's head-and-shoulders above the Intel XE and Radeon Vega-powered portable gaming devices that made it to market first, creating a situation where you shouldn't really be looking at an alternative if you can get your hands on a Steam Deck. 

The Steam Deck is now available  You can read the full written Steam Deck review by Alessandro Barbosa on GameSpot.
