daddy made you your favorite, open wide

In this video, we explore the sounds of the Noise Engineering Cursus Iteritas Percido eurorack synth voice. We'll feed it pitch and modulation via the Clank Chaos sequencer, trigger it with Intellijel Tete and Tetrapad, and process it with a custom techno patch on the Empress Effects Zoia Euroburo.

This is going to get nasty.
