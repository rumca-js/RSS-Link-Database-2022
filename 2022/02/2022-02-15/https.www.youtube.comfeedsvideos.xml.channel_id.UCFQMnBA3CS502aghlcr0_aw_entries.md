Uncovering a ring of NFT Scammers and exposing them before they were able to make $20,000,000 with Squiggles, an NFT project that recently appeared and got delisted from opensea. Including the series of shadow wallets that got involved in pumping the volume for Squiggles and explaining what that could mean. . 
Oh and by the way, they were involved in MoonPortal too

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
