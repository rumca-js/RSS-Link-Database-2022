A twisted wonderland of corruption and splendor, Savathûn’s Throne World plays host to a fragile balance of terrifying power. From the foundation of her glistening palace to the gnarled roots in the swamp, all that she hides can be found here. Seek the truth and learn that in this place, mystery makes its home in both the Darkness and the Light.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has so much content to complete once players hit the credits. In this video we break down everything to do, from shiny hunting, to chasing down Giratina, Enamorous, and other legendary Pokémon.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has a lot of surprises for Pokémon fans, new and old alike, but the endgame is remarkably similar to past games in the franchise. Players will aim to research their Pokedex to completion, which will require travel to all four corners of the Hisui region. Like older games, there are plenty of challenging legendary Pokémon to catch, mythical Pokémon to pursue, and shiny Pokémon to hunt.

In this video, we break down all the different objectives, and activities players can complete once they beat the main game. Some tasks are straightforward, like completing the post-campaign narrative, while others aren't explicitly stated, like finding all 28 Unowns or getting the 2 remaining starters. Be sure to check out our other endgame guide for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl. For everything else, stay with GameSpot.
