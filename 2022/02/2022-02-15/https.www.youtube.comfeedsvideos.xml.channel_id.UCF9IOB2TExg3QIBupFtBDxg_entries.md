Oklahoma Physicians Are Not Prohibited From Prescribing Off-Label Medicines to Fight COVID-19

https://www.oag.ok.gov/articles/attorney-general-oconnor-assures-oklahoma-physicians-are-not-prohibited-prescribing-label
The Attorney General’s office finds no legal basis for a state medical licensure board to discipline a licensed physician for exercising sound judgement 
and safely prescribing an FDA-approved drug – like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine – for the off-label purpose of treating a patient with COVID-19
Attorney General John O’Connor
I stand behind doctors who believe it is in their patients’ best interests to receive ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
Our healthcare professionals should have every tool available to combat COVID-19. 
Public safety demands this. 
Physicians who prescribe medications and follow the law should not fear disciplinary action for prescribing such drugs
The Attorney General’s office neither condones nor condemns a specific course of treatment for COVID-19. 
Our office maintains that proper healthcare decisions are to be made between a patient and his or her physician, 
and the government should not interfere with their relationship.
FDA position unchanged

Zita Taylor, RN for 30 years

My son turned 12 on 3rd February and is now eligible for his first covid vaccine. 

After some consideration, I decided to take him to a large vaccination centre in Manchester yesterday. 

We checked in, passed the screening questions & then I asked if the needle could be aspirated before the injection was given. 

The response I got was shocking. 

I was told very rudely 'no' nurse and then the clinical lead,

you don't need to

you'll put air in & that's bad

it's not recommended

something bad might happen

I was trained to always aspirate an intramuscular injection to ensure the drug was injected into muscle.
