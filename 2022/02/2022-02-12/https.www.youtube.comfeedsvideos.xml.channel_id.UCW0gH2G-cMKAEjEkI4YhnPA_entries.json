Super Bowl Sunday w/ TheOneRing.net", "description": "I'll be joining the folks at The One Ring for the OFFICIAL The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power trailer watch party!  As a special treat, the good folks at TORn and I have worked it out so that we will simulcast the stream to my channel in addition to their YouTube, Twitter, etc.  Check them out here: @TheOneRingNet \n\nAfter the teaser airs, we will screen it live and give our reactions, extensive analysis, and take questions/comments/thoughts from YOU in the live chat!  Click \"Set Reminder\" so you get notified when we go LIVE!  (Scheduled time is subject to change depending on when the teaser actually airs.)\n\nRings of Power Description:\nBeginning in a time of relative peace, we follow an ensemble cast of characters as they confront the re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N\u00famenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\n#ringsofpower #lotrrop #lotronprime", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoFnHAUR12s", "date_published": "2022-02-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCW0gH2G-cMKAEjEkI4YhnPA", "title": "Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n the Golden, Last King of N\u00famenor | Tolkien Explained", "description": "Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n leads and already darkening N\u00famenor to its destruction.

After Tar-Palantir dies, he would marry his cousin Tar-M\u00edriel, lead his grand army to confront Sauron, and fall to Sauron's influence and lies.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\nTo purchase artist work, check out these amazing artists!\n\nJenny Dolfen - goldseven.wordpress.com/\nTurner Mohan - www.instagram.com/turner_mohan\nTed Nasmith - www.tednasmith.com/shop/\nJerry Vanderstelt - store.vandersteltstudio.com/main.sc\nAnke Eissmann - http://anke.edoras-art.de/anke_illustration.html\nDonato Giancola - https://www.donatoarts.com/online-store/secure-store/Middle-earth-c34110463\nAronja Art - https://www.instagram.com/aronjaart/\nSteamey - https://www.deviantart.com/steamey\nKip Rasmussen - https://www.kiprasmussen.com/\nCK Goksoy - https://www.artstation.com/ckgoksoy\nIvan Cavini - https://www.instagram.com/ivan_cavini/\nSoni Alcorn-Hender - https://www.redbubble.com/people/BohemianWeasel/shop\n\nAr-Pharzon Armor - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe Last Hunt - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon - Steamey\nAr-Pharazon - Celmence Morisseau\nEldalonde - Ralph Damiani\nArmenelos - Ralph Damiani\nAdunakhori - Tom Romain\nAndunie - Ralph Damiani\nWhite Ships - Ted Nasmith\nAldarion Returns From His First Voyage - Ted Nasmith\nBreath of Arda, Manwe - Christina Kraus\nThe Destroying Wave Over Numenor - Kip Rasmussen\nNumenorean Armor Color - Turner Mohan\nAragorn fighting Orcs - Donato Giancola\nAr-Pharazon and Tar-Miriel - Nemanja Bubalo\nAr-Pharazon closeup - Nemanja Bubalo\nQueen Beruthiel - Turner Mohan\nMeneltarma - Ralph Damiani\nTar-Miriel - Turner Mohan\nDenethor - Anna Kulisz\nSauron the Deceiver - Skullb*st*rd\nImperial Numenorean Armour - Turner Mohan\nBoromir Defending Osgiliath - Catherine Karina Chmiel\nMoria Orc - John Howe\nSauron bows, submits to Ar-Pharazon - Kip Rasmussen\nStalker - Skullb*st*rd\nNumenor - Sarka Skorpikova\nWitch-king - Skullb*st*rd\nSauron high priest - Nemanja Bubalo\nValar, Mandos - Anna Kulisz\nValar, Melkor - Anna Kulisz\nMorgoth and the High King of the Noldor - Ted Nasmith\nEru Iluvatar - Janka Lateckova\nThe White Tree - Aegeri\nThe White Tree - Ted Nasmith\nMan in the alley - Felix Englund\nIsildur - Soni Alcorn-Hender\nOdin visits Volsung's Hall - Alan Lee\nArmenelos - Nemanja Bubalo\nWriting - Anke Eissmann\nSauron's Priests - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe Pale King - Skullb*st*rd\nAr-Pharazon old - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe King's Councelor - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon and Sauron - Janka Lateckova\nThe Shores of Valinor - Ted Nasmith\nThe Silmarillion - Skullb*st*rd\nAr-Pharazon's Ships - John Howe\nEagles of Manwe - Ted Nasmith\nRed Skyline - Felix Englund\nDenethor - Anna Kulisz\nAr-Pharazon on Throne - Clemence Morisseau\nTaniquetil - Ted Nasmith\nLight of Valinor - Ted Nasmith\nVarda of the Stars at Her Work of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nEru and Gods Singing the First Song of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nFall of Numenor - Darrell Sweet\nDrowning of Andunie - John Howe\nBreaking ground - Bellabergolts\nQueen Tar-Miriel - Ted Nasmith\nThe Ships of the Faithful - Ted Nasmith\nCrashing Waves - Felix Englund\nSauron - Shadow of War\n\nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
