I'll be joining the folks at The One Ring for the OFFICIAL The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power trailer watch party!  As a special treat, the good folks at TORn and I have worked it out so that we will simulcast the stream to my channel in addition to their YouTube, Twitter, etc.  Check them out here: @TheOneRingNet 

After the teaser airs, we will screen it live and give our reactions, extensive analysis, and take questions/comments/thoughts from YOU in the live chat!  Click "Set Reminder" so you get notified when we go LIVE!  (Scheduled time is subject to change depending on when the teaser actually airs.)

Rings of Power Description:
Beginning in a time of relative peace, we follow an ensemble cast of characters as they confront the re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.

Ar-Pharazôn leads and already darkening Númenor to its destruction. We cover his life, travels, and his fall to Sauron.  His youth features an unlikely friendship and a rise to power, leading the King's Men faction of Númenóreans. After Tar-Palantir dies, he would marry his cousin Tar-Míriel, lead his grand army to confront Sauron, and fall to Sauron's influence and lies.
