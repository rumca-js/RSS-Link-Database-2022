Zero covid policy

Kwai Chung, locked down 7 days

Garbage, like a mountain

No flights

Cases, + 1,200 (past 2 days)

4,000 people in government-run centers

limiting outdoor gatherings to two people

Closed religious sites and hair salons

At this moment, we still feel that this is the best strategy for Hong Kong

Beijing, a deviation from the policy would be a disaster for the city

Over 80s, 22 % have had 2 doses of vaccine

Just half of those between 70 and 79 are vaccinated

Centers for Disease Control

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/04/wastewater-coronavirus-cdc-expanding-system/?utm_campaign=wp_to_your_health&utm_medium=email&utm

Expand wastewater analysis

Early-warning power to find other deadly pathogens

Control outbreaks of food-borne disease

40% to 80% of coronavirus infections shed viral genetic material in their feces

even if asymptomatic

Early sign of infection

Increases in wastewater virus levels, 4 to 6 days before health officials notice

Amy Kirby, CDC wastewater surveillance system

These data are uniquely powerful because they capture the presence of infections from people with and without symptoms

and are not affected by access to health care or availability of clinical testing

Also

Antibiotic resistant bacteria

norovirus, influenza, Candida auris, E. coli, salmonella

Currently, coronavirus data from 400 testing sites

28 States, 34,000 samples

Some genetic sequencing

Early warning

Situational awareness 

Directing mobile testing

Dispatch mobile testing teams

Readying additional health care provision

Boston conclude that omicron had peaked

Out of 255 surveillance systems 

70% decline in virus over the past 15 days

30% reported increases

The thing is that articles in Journals like the BMJ are already fact checked. 

The process is known as "Peer Review". 

Before any article in a decent scientific journal is published it has to be reviewed by experts in that field.

They look at the methodology used in the work and check to see that the conclusions arrived are reasonably made given the data which the experimentation has produced. 

High quality journals like the BMJ only publish work of the very best scientific rigour. 

For facebook to think they know better than this process is pathetic in the extreme.

John, please could you review this article from Israel national News, it says the risk of myocarditis following mRNA COVID vaccination is around 133 times greater than the background risk in the population, is this true? If it is true, why is this not all over MSM?

Myocarditis Cases Reported After mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination in the US From December 2020 to August 2021 (25 January)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788346

JAMA. 2022;327(4):331-340. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.24110

Importance

Vaccination against COVID-19 provides clear public health benefits, 

but vaccination also carries potential risks. 

The risks and outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are unclear.

To describe reports of myocarditis and the reporting rates after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US.

Descriptive study

Reports of myocarditis to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html

After mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine administration

Between December 2020 and August 2021 in 

n = 192,405,448 older than 12 years of age in the US

During the analytic period

BNT162b2 vaccine, 12 years and older

mRNA-1273 vaccine, 18 years and over

Exposures

Vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna)

Main Outcomes and Measures

Expected rates of myocarditis by age and sex were calculated using 2017-2019 claims data. 

For persons younger than 30 years of age, medical record reviews and clinician interviews were conducted to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic test results, treatment, and early outcomes.

Results  

Among 192,405,448 persons

Receiving a total of 354,100, 845 mRNA vaccines

1,991 reports of myocarditis to VAERS

1,626 met the case definition of myocarditis

Of those with myocarditis

Median age, 21 years (IQR, 16-31 years)

Median time to symptom onset, 2 days (IQR, 1-3 days)

Males

Comprised 82% of myocarditis cases

Reporting rates for cases of myocarditis

Within 7 days after COVID-19 vaccination,

exceeded the expected rates of myocarditis across multiple age and sex strata 

Rates of myocarditis were highest after the second vaccination dose

Adolescent males aged 12 to 15 years

70.7 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine

(One case per 14,144 vaccinations)

Males aged 16 to 17 years

105.9 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine

(One case per 9,442 vaccinations)

Males aged 18 to 24 years

52.4 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine

(One case per 19,083 vaccinations)

56.3 per million doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine

(One case per 17,761 vaccinations)

Myocarditis in the under 30s

826 cases of myocarditis, who had detailed clinical information available

Of these 826 cases of myocarditis

792 of 809 (98%) had elevated troponin levels

569 of 794 (72%) had abnormal electrocardiogram results

223 of 312 (72%) had abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results

Hospital data

784 of 813 (96%) were hospitalized

577 of 661 (87%) had resolution of presenting symptoms by hospital discharge

Most common treatment

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 589 of 676 (87%).

 

7.26 + 105.86 = 113.12

Expected, 1.34

113.12     
  = 84.4
1.34
