The Minigun is a pop culture cannon of carnage, appearing in hundreds of games and movies. Whether it’s mounted to helicopters in Battlefield, in the arms of Grand Theft Auto V’s bank robbers or churning up the jungle in Predator, developers and filmmakers love to harness the Minigun’s power, but how exactly does it work? (Presented by PUBG MOBILE)

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to discover the surprising origins of the M134 Minigun, and see why it’s one of the least well-represented guns in pop culture history.

## PlayStation Vita 10 Years Later

The PS Vita is a beloved handheld with a diehard cult following. But how does the failed Sony handheld hold up 10 years later to someone using it for the first time?

For many, Vita means life. It means to be a part of a cult following that believed in the handheld more than its makers did. Sony launched the PS Vita with the intention of bringing the AAA game experience to the handheld market, with big flagship IPs like Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Killzone: Mercenary. But in actuality, the console would see its success from indie games and visual novels like Persona 4 Golden, Hotline Miami, and Virtue's Last Reward. 

Kurt Indovina missed the boat to Vita Island when it was first released in the states back in 2012, but now 10 years later, he's picking up the console up for the first time to see what the fuss is about. Join Kurt in a rather unexpected journey to understanding what it means to be a Vita Islander.

How does FromSoftware's latest run on Valve's new portable PC? Take a look for yourself!

Elden Ring and Steam Deck share a launch date, so of course we had to know how the game looks and runs on the system. We set the game to medium graphic settings and get a solid performance outside of the occasional frame hitching, although that issue seems to be PC wide and not Steam deck Specific.

If you want to know more about the Steam Deck, check out our full review from Alessandro Barbosa who said, "The Steam Deck is a wonderfully constructed and powerful portable PC that can, in the right hands, be a lot more than what Valve envisions with SteamOS, given your patience to work with Linux or replace it entirely."

If you want to know more about Elden Ring, check out Tamoor Hussain's review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, "From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience."

## Elden Ring PS5 Saves Being Lost | GameSpot News

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Elden Ring losing PS5 saves, Steam Deck 2 already being discussed, and more.

In a message posted February 25, Bandai Namco said there were several "main items to be revised" in Elden Ring, primarily in the PC version, including an issue with the mouse sensitivity being too high, frame rate issues, and more.

On PS5, save data can be lost if the PS5 shuts off before closing the game--either when it was fully powered or in rest mode--so if you were using rest mode as an artificial pause button, you may want to reconsider.

If you were among the first batch of people to reserve a Steam Deck last year, make sure you're checking your inbox. Emails began going out at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Once it arrives, you'll be able to make your final payment, confirm your shipping details, and (barring any delays) likely get your hands on Steam Deck next week. Despite the Steam Deck not quite out yet, there are reportedly already discussions of a Steam Deck 2.

For all of the Deep Rock Galactic fans out there, the game is celebrating it’s 4 year anniversary with a big in-game event and livestream.
