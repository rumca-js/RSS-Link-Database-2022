Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie never delivers anything less than a committed performance. The Philadelphian rock outfit filled the stage with a raucous lineup that pounded through a set including crowd favorite “Boozeophilia”; a classic rock cover medley that included “Cream,” one of the night’s two Prince covers (“America” came later); and an absolutely epic “Charyse.”
