In this video, I go through it shot-by-shot giving my interpretations, thoughts, and theories.  The teaser certainly left me wanting more - in both good ways, and some ways that are more underwhelming for me as a huge book fan.  We see Galadriel, Gil-galad, Elrond, Durin IV, Disa, Arondir, Halbrand, Finrod, \"Meteor Man\", and new hobbit Elenor \"Nori\" Brandyfoot.  We also got our first look at N\u00famenor, an ice troll, and more.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\nYou can watch the trailer here: https://youtu.be/OCLoZI-FOYA\n\nTo purchase artist work, check out these amazing artists!\n\nJenny Dolfen - goldseven.wordpress.com/\nTed Nasmith - www.tednasmith.com/shop/\nKip Rasmussen - https://www.kiprasmussen.com\n\nHelcaraxe - Jenny Dolfen\nEru and the Gods Singing the First Song of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nMorgoth Came - Jenny Dolfen\nLorien - Brothers Hildebrandt\nThe Burning of the Ships - Ted Nasmith\nFingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxe - Ted Nasmith\n\n#ringsofpower #lotronprime #lotrrop", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQmGXbXpw80", "date_published": "2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
