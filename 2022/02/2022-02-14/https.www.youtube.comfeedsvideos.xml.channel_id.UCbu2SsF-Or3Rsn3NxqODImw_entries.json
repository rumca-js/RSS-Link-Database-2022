In this video we break down everything to do, from shiny hunting, to chasing down Giratina, Enamorous, and other legendary Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus has a lot of surprises for Pok\u00e9mon fans, new and old alike, but the endgame is remarkably similar to past games in the franchise. Players will aim to research their Pokedex to completion, which will require travel to all four corners of the Hisui region. Like older games, there are plenty of challenging legendary Pok\u00e9mon to catch, mythical Pok\u00e9mon to pursue, and shiny Pok\u00e9mon to hunt.\n\nIn this video, we break down all the different objectives, and activities players can complete once they beat the main game. Some tasks are straightforward, like completing the post-campaign narrative, while others aren't explicitly stated, like finding all 28 Unowns or getting the 2 remaining starters.
