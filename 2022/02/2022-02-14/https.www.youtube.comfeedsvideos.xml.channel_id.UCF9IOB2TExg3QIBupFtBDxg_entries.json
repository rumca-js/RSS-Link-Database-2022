the off-label purpose of treating a patient with COVID-19\nAttorney General John O\u2019Connor\nI stand behind doctors who believe it is in their patients\u2019 best interests to receive ivermectin

not fear disciplinary action for prescribing such drugs\nThe Attorney General\u2019s office neither condones nor condemns a specific course of treatment for COVID-19. \nOur office maintains that
