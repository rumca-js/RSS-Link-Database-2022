I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Trip Sunset Boulevard from Hollywood to the mid-Sunset Strip in California in 1952, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”sound design added only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.

Great thanks to Rick Prelinger for share the amazing black and white Video Source
