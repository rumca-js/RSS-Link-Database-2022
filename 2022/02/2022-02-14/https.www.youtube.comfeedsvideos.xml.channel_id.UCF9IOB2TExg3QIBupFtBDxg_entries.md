England – 2,824,700 people (1 in 19)

Wales – 121,200 people (1 in 25)

Northern Ireland – 145,600 people

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK,

accounting for 3 in 20 (15%) of all cases in females and males combined

The next most common cancers in UK 

Prostate,  14%

Lung,  13%

Bowel,  11%

Though there are more than 200 types of cancer, 

just these four types - breast, prostate, lung and bowel,

together account for 53% of all new cases in the UK

Oklahoma Physicians Are Not Prohibited From Prescribing Off-Label Medicines to Fight COVID-19

https://www.oag.ok.gov/articles/attorney-general-oconnor-assures-oklahoma-physicians-are-not-prohibited-prescribing-label
The Attorney General’s office finds no legal basis for a state medical licensure board to discipline a licensed physician for exercising sound judgement 
and safely prescribing an FDA-approved drug – like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine – for the off-label purpose of treating a patient with COVID-19
Attorney General John O’Connor
I stand behind doctors who believe it is in their patients’ best interests to receive ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
Our healthcare professionals should have every tool available to combat COVID-19. 
Public safety demands this. 
Physicians who prescribe medications and follow the law should not fear disciplinary action for prescribing such drugs
The Attorney General’s office neither condones nor condemns a specific course of treatment for COVID-19. 
Our office maintains that proper healthcare decisions are to be made between a patient and his or her physician, 
and the government should not interfere with their relationship.
FDA position unchanged

Zita Taylor, RN for 30 years

My son turned 12 on 3rd February and is now eligible for his first covid vaccine. 

After some consideration, I decided to take him to a large vaccination centre in Manchester yesterday. 

We checked in, passed the screening questions & then I asked if the needle could be aspirated before the injection was given. 

The response I got was shocking. 

I was told very rudely 'no' nurse and then the clinical lead,

you don't need to

you'll put air in & that's bad

it's not recommended

something bad might happen

I was trained to always aspirate an intramuscular injection to ensure the drug was injected into muscle.

Which seems good and long lasting and cheap, lots of evidence below.

Dan et al (2021) Science, Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abf4063

95% of participants tested retained immune memory at about 6 months after having COVID-19

More than 90% of participants had CD4+ T-cell memory at 1 month,

and 6–8 months after having COVID-19

Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,

with an ancestral variant produce antibodies that cross-neutralise emerging variants of concern with high potency

Laboratory staff routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2, 

people who had had COVID-19 previously were 100% protected against reinfection

Clinical studies

Large, multicentre, prospective cohort study

Previous COVID-19 diagnosis,

84% decreased risk of infection

https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(21)00158-2.pdf

Prospective cohort of US Marines, 

seropositive young adults were 82% protected against reinfection

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/74/2/294/6251701?login=false

N = 9,119, serial tests

Reinfection rates, 0.7%

So

Risk of repeat SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased by 80·5–100% among those who had had COVID-19

Protection from reinfection is strong and persists for more than 10 months of follow-up, (Hansen et al 2021 Lancet)

Memory B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1·3 and 6·2 months after infection, which is consistent with longer-term protection

Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 might not benefit from COVID-19 vaccination

One study found that previous COVID-19 was associated with increased adverse events following vaccination with Pfizer

In Switzerland, proof of recovered infection, in the past 12 months are considered equally protected as fully vaccinated,
