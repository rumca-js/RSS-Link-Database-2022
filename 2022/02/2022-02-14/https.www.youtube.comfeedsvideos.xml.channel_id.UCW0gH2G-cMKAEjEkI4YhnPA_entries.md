We finally got our first teaser trailer for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power!  In this video, I go through it shot-by-shot giving my interpretations, thoughts, and theories.  The teaser certainly left me wanting more - in both good ways, and some ways that are more underwhelming for me as a huge book fan.  We see Galadriel, Gil-galad, Elrond, Durin IV, Disa, Arondir, Halbrand, Finrod, "Meteor Man", and new hobbit Elenor "Nori" Brandyfoot.  We also got our first look at NÃºmenor, an ice troll, and more.
