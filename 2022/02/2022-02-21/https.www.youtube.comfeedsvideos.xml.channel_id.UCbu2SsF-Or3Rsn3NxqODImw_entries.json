Anyone who owns games through the Bethesda.net Launcher can migrate them, along with any funds in their wallet, to Steam beginning in April. Most games will have their saves automatically transferred, too, though some will require manual transfers, and one title is not supported at all, Bethesda said. Additionally, the company clarified that all Bethesda.net accounts will remain accessible.\n\nSony has shown off the final design for its upcoming PSVR 2 headset and the accompanying Sense controllers, which feature a look similar to the PS5's design aesthetic. Other features of the headset include a focus on comfort, as the hardware has a lens adjustment dial for users to dial in the distance between their eyes and the lenses, a slight weight reduction when compared to the previous PSVR model, and a new vent design to prevent fogging.\n\nAccording to VGC, 2K Games signed a \"new multi-game partnership with Lego\" that will see the company producing a number of licensed titles, the first of which are a soccer game and an open-world racing game. The soccer game, planned for release this year, is reportedly being developed by Sumo Digital, while the racing game is in the works at 2K's own studio Visual Concepts.\n\nFor more information on today\u2019s topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nBethesda - 00:06\nPlayStation VR2 - 01:04\n2K Lego - 01:57\nOutro - 02:58", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snTkzCC42-g", "date_published": "2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "ELDEN RING Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Though shattered, it shall guide thee.

The upcoming game from the creators of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro will feature a brand new open world, and plenty of other gameplay features both new and familiar to longtime Soulsborne fans. Here's everything you need to know about Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring is the latest game from FromSoftware - creators of Demon\u2019s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and of course, King\u2019s Field. The game takes the basic action RPG mechanics of Dark Souls, but introduces a brand new open world that completely changes things up.\n\nSimilar to the Soulsborne games, as of the closed Beta, players will be able to choose from a number of starting classes, with stats they\u2019ll be able to upgrade as they level up, allowing for a\u00a0 level of freedom in creating your own builds. The starting classes thus far are Vagabond, Warrior, Hero, Bandit, Astrologer, Prophet, Samurai, Prisoner, Confessor, and Wretch - with Wretch being the level 1 build.\n\nStats you can choose to upgrade with each level are: Vigor, Mind, Endurance, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith, and Arcane. This means, similar to prior Soulsborne games, you\u2019ll have the freedom to choose between Strength, Quality, Dex, and varying magic builds - or any merger of those.\n\nLeveling up is only possible after meeting your first finger maiden, Melina; once you have met her, you\u2019ll be able to level up at any of the game\u2019s Sites of Grace - which act similar to bonfires from the Souls games.\n\nAt the Sites of Grace, you\u2019ll be able to manage your Estus Flasks, and - like Dark Souls 3 - you\u2019ll have a variety of Estus Flask types. You\u2019ll have ones that refill your HP, ones that refill your FP, or Focus Points that allow you to cast magic, and a brand new Flask of Wondrous Physick, which is a customizable estus flask that will give you varying attributes depending on what crystal tears you equip to it.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to upgrade how many Estus Flask uses you get by using special Golden seeds. If you recall from the game\u2019s trailer, there are giant golden Erd Trees throughout the game, that are clearly significant. There are also smaller, lesser Erd Trees you can find throughout the game\u2019s map. At these lesser Erd Trees, you\u2019ll find special golden seeds, which are exactly what you need to upgrade your estus flask uses. The number of seeds you need will change as you upgrade your flask, and this isn\u2019t the only way to obtain these seeds. Additionally, you can upgrade the recovery strength of your estus flasks.\n\n#EldenRing #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYo6ZzGz6ig", "date_published": "2022-02-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Steam Deck - Everything To Know", "description": "Ahead of its initial launch in late February 2022, we're taking a look at everything revealed about Valve's Steam Deck so far.\n\nThe Steam Deck is a portable, handheld PC that will ship with Valve's own SteamOS (built on top of Linux). The device is billed as an entirely open platform, letting players install games outside of the Steam ecosystem, run additional PC software alongside them, or just replace the entire OS with Windows if they like. Valve is hoping that most (not all) games will work just fine on SteamOS when the Steam Deck launches, with a lot of work going into improving Proton--a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux without native support, and without (too many) issues.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:30 - What is the Steam Deck?\n02:22 - Price and Versions\n03:17 - Specifications\n04:41 - Game Compatibility\u00a0\n06:13 - Release Date", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOtTGrct4UM", "date_published": "2022-02-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Street Fighter 6 Announcement Teaser Trailer", "description": "HERE COMES A NEW STREET FIGHTER. \n\nIt's official: Street Fighter 6 is in development!
