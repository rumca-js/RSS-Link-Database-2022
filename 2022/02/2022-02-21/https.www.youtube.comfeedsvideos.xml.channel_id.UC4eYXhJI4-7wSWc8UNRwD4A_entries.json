Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nKara Frame || February, 21 2022\nIn a sparse, dimly lit Austin office building, Carl \u201cBuffalo\u201d Nichols stands in front of the mic stand with his steel guitar. As he finger picks into the first song \u201cLiving Hell,\u201d the stark surroundings are juxtaposed against the warmth of his raspy vocals. \n\nHe performs his Tiny Desk (home) concert solo, a testament to the engaging storytelling of the blues, a genre he reclaims on his self-titled debut album. In his three-song set, Nichols sings about not making it into heaven, living in hell and the life of someone who is lost and lonesome. But these aren\u2019t your run of the mill, down-and-out blues songs \u2013 Nichols is adamant about making the genre current and making it Black again. Originally from Wisconsin, he mentions that he moved to the Austin, Texas music scene at the beginning of the pandemic, a fitting preface to his next song that starts with, \u201cIf you see me in your town, looking tired with my head hanging down / You may wonder what went wrong, why am I always all alone.\u201d\n\nBuffalo Nichols\u2019 acoustic set represents all the best parts of Tiny Desk; a humble desk, a talented artist and music that speaks for itself. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cLiving Hell\u201d\n\u201cLost & Lonesome\u201d\n\u201cThese Things\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nBuffalo Nichols: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nDirected by: Aim\u00e9e M.
