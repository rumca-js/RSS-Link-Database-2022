Good choice. In our Elden Ring review in progress, we awarded the game a rare 10/10. But From Software games are notorious for being obtuse, which is part of the charm. So, you\u2019re wondering: Hey, is there anything I should know going into Elden Ring? Well lowly Tarnished, yes, indeed there is. And we're here to help. \n\nIn this Elden Ring beginner's guide video, we offer our nine best tips to make your way through the Lands Between at the start of the game. From the very outset, we let you know which starting gift is best, and where you should look to get Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears to upgrade your Flasks of Tears. A torch is a necessary item in Elden Ring but can be hard to track down, so we also tell you where to grab one early on, as well as how to use Spirit Ashes and duplicate boss souls. There are other tips in there too, so it's very useful if you're playing Elden Ring for the first time.\n\nWe have a separate video to help you choose which Elden Ring class is right for you, as well as more guide content, so make sure you subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out the written versions on gamespot.com.

But which one should you pick? In this guide, we break down every starting class in the new From Software title so you can choose the one that's right for you.\n\nThe first and most important decision you\u2019re going to make at the beginning of Elden Ring is choosing your starting class. Though you can certainly build your character into whatever you want them to be, the 10 starting classes provide you with upfront boosts to specific stats that benefit particular playstyles. In addition, you\u2019ll start off with gear and potentially spells that match said playstyle.\n\nIn this video guide, we walk through each of Elden Ring's starting classes and discuss the benefits of each in the early game. From the Hero class, which is a good melee-focused all-rounder, to the Confessor, a hybrid class that has a lot of points in strength, dexterity, and faith, meaning you can cast incantations without sacrificing melee capabilities. Or, if you truly love pain (and building your character from scratch), you could pick the Wretch, the Elden Ring equivalent of Dark Souls' Deprived class. \n\nWe have a separate video to help you begin your journey in Elden Ring, with our beginner's guide to the game, as well as more guide content, so make sure you subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out the written versions on gamespot.com.

R. Martin.  #eldenring \n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the impact From Software has had on gaming. From birthing its own genre to acting as the inspiration for countless developers, the studio\u2019s games have not only left their mark on how games are designed but also how players interact with them. To celebrate the release of the studio\u2019s latest title, Elden Ring, here\u2019s the history of Soulsborne games.\n\nIn the above video, we chart the history of From Software, and how Hidetaka Miyazaki took its games in bold new directions. Beginning with King's Field, the spiritual predecessor to the Souls games and then charting the course of the series from there. We also take an in-depth look at the creation of Demon's Souls and the daring ideas that Miyakazi brought to the game, which Sony deemed too difficult, and bombed at release, before coming a cult hit in the West. From there, we take a look at the enormous success of Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Dark Souls III, and the communities that sprung up to mine every last secret from the games. While we don't linger too long on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, as it's not typically considered a Soulsborne game, we do delve into Bloodborne, and chart the evolution of From Software's approach to game design and how it's changed over the years in the lead up to Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring launches on February 25, 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
