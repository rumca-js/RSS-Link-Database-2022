The Lands Between can be daunting for new players, so here is our beginner's guide for From Software's Elden Ring, including the best starting gift to take, how to respec your character, where to get a torch, and more.

So, you’ve purchased or are about to purchase Elden Ring. Good choice. In our Elden Ring review in progress, we awarded the game a rare 10/10. But From Software games are notorious for being obtuse, which is part of the charm. So, you’re wondering: Hey, is there anything I should know going into Elden Ring? Well lowly Tarnished, yes, indeed there is. And we're here to help. 

In this Elden Ring beginner's guide video, we offer our nine best tips to make your way through the Lands Between at the start of the game. From the very outset, we let you know which starting gift is best, and where you should look to get Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears to upgrade your Flasks of Tears. A torch is a necessary item in Elden Ring but can be hard to track down, so we also tell you where to grab one early on, as well as how to use Spirit Ashes and duplicate boss souls. There are other tips in there too, so it's very useful if you're playing Elden Ring for the first time.

We have a separate video to help you choose which Elden Ring class is right for you, as well as more guide content, so make sure you subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out the written versions on gamespot.com. In our Elden Ring review in progress, Tamoor Hussain awarded the game 10/10, calling it "a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience."

Elden Ring has 10 starting classes, and each offers its own unique pros and cons. But which one should you pick? In this guide, we break down every starting class in the new From Software title so you can choose the one that's right for you.

The first and most important decision you’re going to make at the beginning of Elden Ring is choosing your starting class. Though you can certainly build your character into whatever you want them to be, the 10 starting classes provide you with upfront boosts to specific stats that benefit particular playstyles. In addition, you’ll start off with gear and potentially spells that match said playstyle.

In this video guide, we walk through each of Elden Ring's starting classes and discuss the benefits of each in the early game. From the Hero class, which is a good melee-focused all-rounder, to the Confessor, a hybrid class that has a lot of points in strength, dexterity, and faith, meaning you can cast incantations without sacrificing melee capabilities. Or, if you truly love pain (and building your character from scratch), you could pick the Wretch, the Elden Ring equivalent of Dark Souls' Deprived class. 

We have a separate video to help you begin your journey in Elden Ring, with our beginner's guide to the game, as well as more guide content, so make sure you subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out the written versions on gamespot.com.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about March's free games via PS Plus, more Pokémon coming to Sword and Shield, and more.

Following a leak, March's PlayStation Plus lineup has been revealed, and it includes Ghostrunner, Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, Team Sonic Racing, and Ark: Survival Evolved.

The PS Plus games for February, which were also leaked, included EA Sports UFC 4, Planet Coaster, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Subscription holders will only have until March to get their hands on these three games before the next batch arrives.

Pokemon Sword and Shield are making some hard-to-find Pokemon a little easier to catch as part of this year's Pokemon Day celebration. You can now find Gigantamax versions of the original Kanto starters--Blastoise, Venusaur, and Charizard--in the Wild area. You have until February 27 at 3:59 PM PT.

As reported by Bloomberg, Activision Blizzard is delaying 2023's Call of Duty in hopes of further polishing the game. Seeing as Microsoft has announced its intention to continue developing Activision franchises for competing console platforms, that likely means we'll see this new Call of Duty launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.

However, in a statement, an Activision spokesperson said, "We have an exciting slate of premium and free-to-play Call of Duty experiences for this year, next year and beyond. Reports of anything otherwise are incorrect. We look forward to sharing more details when the time is right.”

## History of Soulsborne Games

To celebrate the launch of From Software's Elden Ring, we chart the history of the Soulsborne games, from the early success of Demon's Souls and breakout hit Dark Souls, as well as its sequels, to Bloodborne, a spin-off that is regarded as one of the best games ever made, and Elden Ring, a collaboration between Hidetaka Miyakazi and George R. R. Martin.  #eldenring 

It’s hard to overstate the impact From Software has had on gaming. From birthing its own genre to acting as the inspiration for countless developers, the studio’s games have not only left their mark on how games are designed but also how players interact with them. To celebrate the release of the studio’s latest title, Elden Ring, here’s the history of Soulsborne games.

In the above video, we chart the history of From Software, and how Hidetaka Miyazaki took its games in bold new directions. Beginning with King's Field, the spiritual predecessor to the Souls games and then charting the course of the series from there. We also take an in-depth look at the creation of Demon's Souls and the daring ideas that Miyakazi brought to the game, which Sony deemed too difficult, and bombed at release, before coming a cult hit in the West. From there, we take a look at the enormous success of Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Dark Souls III, and the communities that sprung up to mine every last secret from the games. While we don't linger too long on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, as it's not typically considered a Soulsborne game, we do delve into Bloodborne, and chart the evolution of From Software's approach to game design and how it's changed over the years in the lead up to Elden Ring.

Elden Ring launches on February 25, 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more on the game, including our review, make sure to subscribe to GameSpot.

SPOLIER ALERT 

Horizon Forbidden West's massive story line may leave you with some questions. Join Lucy James as she explains the game's ending, as well as what the future may hold for the next Horizon title.

Five years and one DLC later, Horizon Forbidden West has arrived along with its massive follow up story. If you're feeling a little behind after your journey through the Forbidden West, fear not. Lucy James is here to break down the ending and even discuss what may happen next. 

Even after an incredibly vast story, Horizon Forbidden West has loose ends involving everything from main characters, to the future world Aloy and company fought to save. The sentient program "Nemesis" is still active despite its creator's (the Far Zenith) absence. The far Zenith lost their chance to rule the forbidden west, and doing so leave Aloy and crew to fix Gaia AND implement Elizabet Sobek's plan to restart society on earth as it once was. Sylens is seen ready to leave earth and start anew on an all new terraformed planet, but at the last minute changes his mind. Despite this game coming to a happy close, the fight for earth is far from over. Make sure to check out GameSpot's review of Horizon Forbidden West as well as our story recap and combat tips videos. Horizon is available now on PS4 and PS5.

The open world format is constantly getting new entries and sequels, so how does Guerilla Games newest sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, hold up against Breath of the Wild?

While these are two vastly different games, they share some similarities and some interesting design choices that caught our attention while playing. Things such as climbing, gliding, combat, the open world and tower system, have key differences that make each game unique.
