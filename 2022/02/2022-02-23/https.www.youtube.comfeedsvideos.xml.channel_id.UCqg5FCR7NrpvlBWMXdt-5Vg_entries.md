This week on Breakout we discuss our thoughts on Elden Ring, the next game from From Software which takes the "Souls" formula into a new open world setting. We've spent dozens of hours playing the game over the past week and are ready to share our thoughts on it.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
