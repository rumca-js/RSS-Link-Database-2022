It turns out that Linux developers fix their bugs extremely quickly compared to most other big companies.

Speaking of vulnerabilities, it looks like there was a vulnerability in the Snap Package Manager.

Intel confirmed and detailed a timeline for their new discrete GPUs, all under the brand name Arc.

Intel is increasing their investment in Linux, and the latest move is their purchase of Linutronix.

There was a nice blog post about inter-desktop standardization from Nicolas Fella.

It seems that the ReiserFS filesystem might get booted off the Linux kernel.

More KDE progress this week, with interesting new things that should arrive in Plasma 5.25 or in KDE Gear 22.04.

Ubuntu touch received a new over the air update, named OTA-22.

Valve explained in more detail how their game review process works for games on the Steam Deck.

Valve now has its own official tool, that you can access using the link in the description below.

Less good news, though, as GOG won't support the steam deck officially.

More sad Deck news, as Feral won't be updating their Linux ports for the Steam Deck.
