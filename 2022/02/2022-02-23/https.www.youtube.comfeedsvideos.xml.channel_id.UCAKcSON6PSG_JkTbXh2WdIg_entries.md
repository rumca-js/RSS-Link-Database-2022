South London singer-songwriter Jade Bird plays a solo set at The Current's 17th anniversary party, live from First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn. Bird took the stage alone with an acoustic guitar, but played as if she had the entire London Symphony Orchestra behind her. Strumming furiously and smiling contagiously, she drew roars of approval from the crowd in a room that, as she reminded us, sheâ€™s no stranger to.
