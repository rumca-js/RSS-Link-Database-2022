Big time, (at least in the UK, not so much in the US)

Cases down, but not necessarily infections

Confirmed government case data is missing thousands of LFT results, leading to massive under-reporting. 

This subtle but important change in behaviour, highlights the importance of having multiple methods to track COVID in the population,

We saw a similar rebound and second peak during the Delta wave as people relaxed more and children went back to school.

Three dose protection against omicron

ED and urgent care encounters, 82% compared to unvaccinated

Covid associated hospital admission, 90%

Reinfection

7 to 8 % of cases had delta or alpha

Association Between 3 Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine and Symptomatic Infection Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta Variants (21 Jan 2022 JAMA)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485

Prior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron cases, 

approaching  200,000 new cases a day, 

hospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths are still coming down,

as Omicron is less severe in a vaccinated population. 

It seems many are, again, preempting the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

It’s much too early for this.

High case rates will likely be with us until late spring before the warmer weather and the summer holidays help reduce infections again. 

and shows the power of the citizen scientists that log with ZOE every day.

I am a retired RN. Over the last several weeks I have had many friends and family come down with Covid, including myself. 

We all weathered it fine except for one, 61 y/o female relative. 

She developed pneumonia and ended up in hospital for 3 days. 

Thankfully, she is home now with oxygen PRN. 

But....she is the only one who is morbidly obese, type 2 diabetic with poorly controlled blood sugar. 

To me, that says a lot about risk.

Pitchfork

As a kid in grade school in Boston during the 1970s and 1980s, I remember that there were always about 3 or 4 kids who had weight problems in my class. 

When I was a substitute teacher from about 2000-2008, more than half of the students in any given class had weight problems. 

This problem has been trending in the wrong direction for decades in the US. 

Exacerbated by cheap, unhealthy fast food, and sedentary lifestyles.

Gradually reopen borders to citizens, workers and international travellers

Thousands of New Zealanders remain stranded abroad

Full reopening to non-citizens in October.

Put an end to all coronavirus-related laws. 

Danish government

Virus, no longer deemed a critical threat to society

No longer a legal obligation to self-isolate if positive

BA.2 omicron now dominates infections in Denmark

Tyra Grove Krause, director of infection preparedness, (infectious diseases agency SSI)

There was nothing for it but to let omicron run through the population

With omicron, it is impossible to stop the spread of infection, even with severe restrictions

Natural immunity and vaccinations,

send cases down by middle of February

As far as community health is concerned, 

Covid is now on a par with the common cold.

Michael Bang Petersen, professor political science and government advisor

Throughout the pandemic, our data shows that the key worry of Danes is not their own health, but overwhelmed hospitals
Epidemiology in Denmark has not been politicised.

Social consensus and trust in government have been Denmark’s hallmarks. 

If you have a strategy based on trust and solidarity, then you can actually open up with a relatively broad agreement, 

where the vulnerable and the elderly are accepting of the risks
taking on a personal responsibility, 

allow younger groups to live life as normal again.

a trade-off based on data

You could say that a lot of young people have been showing solidarity with the elderly throughout the pandemic, 
and now the elderly are showing some solidarity with the younger generations

Søren Brostrøm, Danish Health Authority

I’m keeping my sights on the seriously ill, 

and looking at figures for inpatients in intensive care units

which, by the way, have just kept falling and falling and are now incredibly low

We have sky-high immunity in the population, 

partly due to our large vaccine acceptance, but also from the wide spread of omicron

This also means that we will start to see the back end of this
Prof Lone Simonsen, epidemiologist, Roskilde University

I think that this is the last sort of lockdown-crazy pandemic wave

Having gone through two, three, four pandemic waves,

which is normal for recent historical pandemics,

I imagine Covid control will soon be similar to that of seasonal flu

Dear John,
One of the factors you might not fully appreciate from outside the states is how really poor our “health care system” (or lack thereof) in United States is.

We are well known for some fantastic institutions, but only the very well off and very well insured are sure of good care.  

Many people have insufficient or no health insurance.  Many of our hospitals are run like businesses, by cutting staff and costs with no consideration for quality of patient care.  

Many people with comorbidities don’t get them controlled because they can’t afford the doctor visit, or the tests, or the time off work, or the actual medications.

I’m sure you’ll agree that a covid patient with controlled hypertension or diabetes will have better chances of a good outcome than a patient with uncontrolled comorbidities.

Our unfortunate political priorities, I believe, created many bad outcomes.

RN, MA

DMN

My family knows a lot of people who've died from Covid. A lot. 

At least 12 people. Varying ages from 30-70's and the one thing they all had in common was either/and obesity and high blood pressure. 

The US is incredibly unhealthy, particularly in the South and in poorer areas. 

It seems almost no one is mentioning this as not only a pandemic but an epidemic of very, very bad health. You can go into a Walmart or Target in east texas and I am not exaggerating as much as 75% of the people you see are obese. 

Not thin. Not normal. 

Not overweight. 

Obese.
