After all, both its previous games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2, fall squarely into the survival horror genre, with the first directed by studio founder Shinji Mikami--the creator of Resident Evil. But while Ghostwire: Tokyo was described as \"spooky\" by former director Ikumi Nakamura on stage during E3 2019 when it was first announced, Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't seem like a game that's likely to scare you. Instead, it seems like an indication that Tango Gameworks is venturing into different areas than what players might expect.\n\nRead GameSpot's Ghostwire: Tokyo developer interview: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghostwire-tokyo-wants-to-mix-up-the-tired-open-world-formula/1100-6500250/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2A3BYOX850", "date_published": "2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Resident Evil 4 HD Project vs Original Graphics Comparison", "description": "Capcom's Resident Evil 4 gets a free HD mod on PC.
