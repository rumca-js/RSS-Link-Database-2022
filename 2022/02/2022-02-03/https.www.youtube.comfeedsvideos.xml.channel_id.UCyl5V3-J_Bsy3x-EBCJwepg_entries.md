The Babylon Bee remembers the first year of Joe Biden’s Presidency since he might have forgotten it and also talks to historian Arthur Herman about how to be more like the Vikings, but not the football team. The Bee also has an exclusive statement from Justin Trudeau, Weakly News from Adam Yenser, and an inside look to this week at The Babylon Bee.
