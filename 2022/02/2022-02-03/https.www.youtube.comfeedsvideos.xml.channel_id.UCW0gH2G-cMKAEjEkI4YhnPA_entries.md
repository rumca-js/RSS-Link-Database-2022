After a day that saw 23 character posters released for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, I'm breaking down each one with some observations, theories, and even some dwarven and elvish translations.  Some posters give us massive clues about the show and while some are incredibly vague, others have almost certainly confirmed which characters are pictured!

Special thanks to my friends who translated the languages!
