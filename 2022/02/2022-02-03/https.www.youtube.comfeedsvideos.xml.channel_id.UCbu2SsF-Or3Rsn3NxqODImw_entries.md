In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the official confirmation of GTA 6, Call Of Duty’s “New Generation”, and more. 

Rockstar said in a blog post that the next installment in the Grand Theft Auto series is "well underway." Whether or not the new game is called GTA 6 or something else remains to be seen. The studio did not reveal any specifics about the new game, which is rumored to have a Fortnite-style evolving map.

Google has reportedly changed the purpose and branding of Stadia's technology in order to shop the platform's streaming capabilities to other partners. The platform's streaming technology is under a new name: Google Stream.

Later in the video, Persia talks about the official Infinity Ward Twitter account confirmed a "new generation" of Call of Duty would be coming soon, telling fans to "stay frosty." The new game is expected to launch in 2022, following Activision Blizzard's annual release cycle but there are no official dates announced yet.

A hands-off preview of Ghostwire: Tokyo suggests the game includes some of the things Tango Gameworks is known for, but demonstrates the developer striking off in a new direction.

Developer Tango Gameworks is best known for horror games, and that might skew perceptions of its upcoming title, Ghostwire: Tokyo. After all, both its previous games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2, fall squarely into the survival horror genre, with the first directed by studio founder Shinji Mikami--the creator of Resident Evil. But while Ghostwire: Tokyo was described as "spooky" by former director Ikumi Nakamura on stage during E3 2019 when it was first announced, Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't seem like a game that's likely to scare you. Instead, it seems like an indication that Tango Gameworks is venturing into different areas than what players might expect.

Originally released in 2005 as an exclusive for the Nintendo GameCube, the game has seen it’s number of ports and versions on just about every modern platform. Today, while you’re able to revisit RE4 on your phone or in virtual reality, little has been done to upgrade the 17-year-old graphics and textures.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the Nintendo Switch having plenty of years left in it, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands going gold, and more.

During today's earnings call, Furukawa shared, “"Switch is just in the middle of its lifecycle, and the momentum going into this year is good.” He also mentioned that the Switch is breaking a pattern of past consoles weakening in the sixth year. 

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has gone gold meaning Gearbox Software has completed work on it. While the game is ready for publish, there'll still be some fine-tuning to do ahead of its March 25 release, which will likely include the usual updates and optimizations.

Later in the video, Persia talks about a demake of Persona 4 created by SeanSS that has just released on itch.io. Sean built the demake on the free GameBoy Studio engine, and it is one of his "very first projects using the engine." To play it, you can open it directly on your browser or you can download the file and use an emulator.
