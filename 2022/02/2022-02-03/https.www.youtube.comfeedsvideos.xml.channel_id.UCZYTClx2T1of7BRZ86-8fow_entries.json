And other researchers found that it's possible to help African clawed frogs regrow lost limbs, an ability they normally lose once they hit adulthood.\n\nHosted by: Hank Green\n\nSciShow is on TikTok!

The Kavli Prize honors scientists for breakthroughs in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience \u2014 transforming our understanding of the very big, the very small, and the very complex. To learn more about the work of David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian, go to https://kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/prizes/2020-kavli-prize-neuroscience.\n\nWe didn't understand how our bodies processed pain until recently. From hot peppers to slamming your hand in a drawer, recent research suggests that pain from various sources can be processed in a surprisingly similar way.\n\nCorrection:\n3:15: Piezo2 does not work faster than Piezo1. Also, without functioning Piezo2 channels, touch wouldn't always feel harmless, and those channels couldn't be turned back on. Here instead we should have said, \"Piezo2 is similar to Piezo1, and it plays a role in our ability to sense touch and pain.\" Thank you to all of you who caught this and helped us correct our mistake! \n\nHosted by: Hank Green\n\nSciShow is on TikTok!
