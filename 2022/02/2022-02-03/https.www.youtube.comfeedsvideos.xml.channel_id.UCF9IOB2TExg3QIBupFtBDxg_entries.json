Many of our hospitals are run like businesses, by cutting staff and costs with no consideration for quality of patient care.  \n\nMany people with comorbidities don\u2019t get them controlled because they can\u2019t afford the doctor visit, or the tests, or the time off work, or the actual medications.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that a covid patient with controlled hypertension or diabetes will have better chances of a good outcome than a patient with uncontrolled comorbidities.\n\nOur unfortunate political priorities, I believe, created many bad outcomes.\n\nRN, MA\n\nDMN\n\nMy family knows a lot of people who've died from Covid. A lot. \n\nAt least 12 people. Varying ages from 30-70's and the one thing they all had in common was either/and obesity and high blood pressure. \n\nThe US is incredibly unhealthy, particularly in the South and in poorer areas. \n\nIt seems almost no one is mentioning this as not only a pandemic but an epidemic of very, very bad health. You can go into a Walmart or Target in east texas and I am not exaggerating as much as 75% of the people you see are obese. \n\nNot thin. Not normal. \n\nNot overweight. \n\nObese.\n\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.28.22270044v1\n\n\nA LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON COVID-19 MORTALITY", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2qSrcq-Jz0", "date_published": "2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
