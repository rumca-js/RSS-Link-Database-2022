This week on Breakout we discuss our thoughts about the upcoming The Rings of Power TV series and just how rough it's gotten in the media space to cover adaptions that bank on nostalgia while also going in new directions.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
