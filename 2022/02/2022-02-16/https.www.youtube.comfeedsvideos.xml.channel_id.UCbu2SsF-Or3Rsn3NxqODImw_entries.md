How much better does the next-gen version really look? More than you might except.

CD Projekt RED dropped the surprise bombshell that is Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.5 Patch on Tuesday. This not only included a host of improvements and gameplay tweaks, but also marked the release of the long awaited next-gen versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The new versions include a performance mode that runs at 60fps at a dynamic 4K, as well as a ray tracing mode that includes ray traced shadows at 30fps dynamic 4K.

In this video we compare the PS4 Pro version of Cyberpunk running on a PS5 with patch 1.31, vs the native PS5 version running on the new 1.5 patch. Even without the ray traced shadows there is a noticeable difference between the two versions, with updated lighting, higher res textures, and even better model detail. It's nice to see more than just a simple resolution and frame rate bump with these next-generation versions.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Elden Ring spoilers emerging online, confirmation of the Metro’s fate in Cyberpunk 2077, and more. 

While Elden Ring has a planned launch of February 25, some players have managed to get their copies just over a week early, and are streaming the game on Twitch. Not only that, but the game's intro cinematic has been released early, alongside some screengrabs and gameplay features.

Now that players have had some time with Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.5 patch, they’re starting to discover all types of new secrets under the hood. However, a screenshot shared on reddit of an existing asset had the Metro discussion circulating again. Cyberpunk 2077’s Global Community Director, Marcin Momot, was quick to clarify on twitter that there will definitely not be a Metro added to the game and the screenshot that was circulating was completely unrelated.

A new patch for Dying Light 2 has gone live on PC, and between a few tweaks to the zombie apocalypse sandbox, one of the game's more annoying bugs has been fixed. Dying during a quest within a restricted area would result in them being respawned in a different area, and facing a time limit that would not allow them to get back to the previous mission area on time. That issue has been fixed, alongside a few others.
