We got a Lenovo ThinkCenter that will lock down any CPU installed in it.. we think. The information is very poor so we need to try it for ourselves.

Anthony would like to apologize to Sony for having way too much fun messing around with a jailbroken PS4 Pro. Cheats? You bet. Homebrewed Software? Totally. Linux? You better believe it. HALO AND MARIOKART?… HECK. YES. Why buy a PS5 when you can do this?
