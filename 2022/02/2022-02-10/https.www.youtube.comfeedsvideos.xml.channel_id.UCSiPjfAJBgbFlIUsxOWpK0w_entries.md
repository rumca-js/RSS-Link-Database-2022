It turns out The Pointer Sisters are mad good at writing hits. Jack and I have been listening (and dancing) to them a lot this year.

LYRICS
Your eyes tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heartbeat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, I can feel you getting hotter
Oh baby

I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more, then

Jump for my love
Jump in, and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, for my love
I know this heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, for my love

You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try to go much further
Oh baby

You are the one, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more then

Jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, for my love
I know this heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, for my love
