Christian Schaller, the director for Desktop at Red Hat, wrote an interesting blog post about "use case Linux distros", which basically means distributions made to answer a specific use case.
https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/02/01/getting-rid-of-the-need-for-the-usecase-linux-distribution/

Speaking of usecase distros, Zorin OS 16 Education was released.

The Steam Deck is being revealed bit by bit, and it seems that AMD's super sampling technology, called AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, or FSR, is being added to SteamOS's compositor, Gamescope

Reviewers have started putting the Deck through its paces, and we got some nice benchmarks.

Speaking of which, there are now 243 games that are verified on the Deck, and 412 games in total if you also include the "Playable" titles.

And finally, let's stay on Gaming, with Tim Sweeeny, CEO of Epic games, stating on Twitter that Easy Anti Cheat isn't good enough in terms of Proton support, to enable Fortnite to use it.
