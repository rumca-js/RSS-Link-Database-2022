In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the Nintendo Switch having plenty of years left in it, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands going gold, and more.

During today's earnings call, Furukawa shared, “"Switch is just in the middle of its lifecycle, and the momentum going into this year is good.” He also mentioned that the Switch is breaking a pattern of past consoles weakening in the sixth year. 

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has gone gold meaning Gearbox Software has completed work on it. While the game is ready for publish, there'll still be some fine-tuning to do ahead of its March 25 release, which will likely include the usual updates and optimizations.

Later in the video, Persia talks about a demake of Persona 4 created by SeanSS that has just released on itch.io. Sean built the demake on the free GameBoy Studio engine, and it is one of his "very first projects using the engine." To play it, you can open it directly on your browser or you can download the file and use an emulator.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about PlayStations plans to launch 10 live service games by 2026, Uncharted possibly coming to Fortnite, and more.

Appearing on the official PlayStation podcast, Hulst said Bungie has succeeded and prospered in the live-service category, which is no easy task. Sony wants to do much more in the space and just announced plans to launch 10 live-service games by 2026.

Twitter user Egyptian_Leaker seemingly discovered an unreleased Fortnite challenge within game files that read "Collect Treasure using an Uncharted Treasure Map." This suggests that the live-action Uncharted movie starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg as Nathan Drake and Victor "Sully" Sullivan could be coming to the battle royale.

Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has reportedly been delayed until next year. No specific reason for the delay was given, and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to officially comment on the game's alleged delay.
