This week, Mary Lucia talks about the two-part series JANET, the Janet Jackson documentary, airing and streaming now on A&E and Lifetime. 

"I'm not going to get too deep into it because it itself is not too deep," Mary says. Highlights include Jackson's return to her hometown of Gary, Indiana, and the reels and reels of performance footage from the earliest days right up to now. 

"Janet Jackson is amazing," Mary continues, but finds aspects of the documentary a little disappointing. Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above.
