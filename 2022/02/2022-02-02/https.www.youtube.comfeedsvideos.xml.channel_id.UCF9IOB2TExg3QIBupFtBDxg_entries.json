Many of our hospitals are run like businesses, by cutting staff and costs with no consideration for quality of patient care.  \n\nMany people with comorbidities don\u2019t get them controlled because they can\u2019t afford the doctor visit, or the tests, or the time off work, or the actual medications.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that a covid patient with controlled hypertension or diabetes will have better chances of a good outcome than a patient with uncontrolled comorbidities.\n\nOur unfortunate political priorities, I believe, created many bad outcomes.\n\nRN, MA\n\nDMN\n\nMy family knows a lot of people who've died from Covid. A lot. \n\nAt least 12 people. Varying ages from 30-70's and the one thing they all had in common was either/and obesity and high blood pressure. \n\nThe US is incredibly unhealthy, particularly in the South and in poorer areas. \n\nIt seems almost no one is mentioning this as not only a pandemic but an epidemic of very, very bad health. You can go into a Walmart or Target in east texas and I am not exaggerating as much as 75% of the people you see are obese. \n\nNot thin. Not normal. \n\nNot overweight. \n\nObese.\n\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.28.22270044v1\n\n\nA LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON COVID-19 MORTALITY", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2qSrcq-Jz0", "date_published": "2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Are omicron vaccines needed", "description": "Pfizer and Moderna, initiated clinical trials with Omicron-based vaccines\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00199-z?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=5a09adda49-briefing-dy-2022031&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-5a09adda49-44762053\n\nPfizer and Moderna, both announced that they have initiated clinical trials using Omicron-based vaccines\n\nSuch high US death rates\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/01/science/covid-deaths-united-states.html\n\nAt least 63% higher than in other large, wealthy nations\n\nBut lower than, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Greece, Czech Republic\n\nJoseph Dieleman, associate professor University of Washington\nThe U.S. stands out as having a relatively high fatality rate\n\nThere\u2019s been more loss than anyone wanted or anticipated\n\nDespite omicron and vaccination\n\nFactors\n\nLower vaccination rates and boosters in most vulnerable people\n\nUnvaccinated people make up a majority of hospitalized patients\n\nWaning protection from early vaccinations\n\nUpboosted, uninfected older people\n\nSome deaths after lengthy Delta\n\nOmicron, likely responsible for a majority of current deaths\n\nRobert Anderson, mortality statistics, C.D.C.\n\nAnd the increases we\u2019re seeing are probably in Omicron deaths\nDavid Dowdy, epidemiologist, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health\n\nWe\u2019ve finally started getting to a stage where most of the population has been exposed either to a vaccine or the virus multiple times by now\n\nI think we\u2019re now likely to start seeing things be more synchronized going forward.\n\nComorbidities\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01114-w\n\nHumoral arm of innate immunity,\n\nincludes diverse molecules with antibody-like functions\n\nSome serve as disease severity biomarkers in covid\n\nHuman humoral fluid-phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) \n\nOf 12 PRMs tested, 2 acted against SARS-CoV-2\n\nBound to viral nucleocapsid and spike proteins\n\nMannose-binding lectin (MBL) was predicted to recognize the Omicron VoC\n\nGenetic polymorphisms at the MBL2 locus were associated with disease severity", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2aXZ4WXXU", "date_published": "2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
