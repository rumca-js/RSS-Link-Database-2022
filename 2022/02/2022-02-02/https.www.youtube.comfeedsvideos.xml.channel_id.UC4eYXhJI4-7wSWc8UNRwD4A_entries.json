Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | February 3, 2022\nFatoumata Diawara is a true multi-hyphenate \u2013 an esteemed Malian singer, songwriter and actress who left her home country at 19 to pursue her artistry in France. By way of Como, Italy, she delivers a riveting performance alongside her bandmates, many of whom have toured with her since 2018. The guitarist and keyboardist here \u2013 Yacouba Kone and Arecio Smith \u2013 both contributed to her Grammy-nominated album, Fenfo.\n\nRich, textured guitars complement her native Bambara vocals and bring a contemporary feel to her traditional Malian sound. These renditions are sonically disparate from her album versions. On \"Kanou Dan Yen,\" Fatoumata's captivating and calming aura is as contagious as her electric smile. \"Nterini\" is a touching ode to her lover about how distance creates enormous heartache. Fatoumata ends her set on a vibrant note with \"Negue Negue,\" an uptempo Afrobeat jam with rambunctious rhythm and spirit.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kanou Dan Yen\"\n\"Nterini\"\n\"Negue Negue\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFatoumata Diawara: vocals, guitar\nYacouba Kone: guitar\nJuan Finger: bass\nArecio Smith: keys\nYves William Ombe Monkama: drums, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nProduction: Montuno Producciones y Eventos, S.L\nAudio Recording: Andrea Fognini & Davide Lasala at Edac Studio, Como Italy\nVideo Recording: OLO Creative Farm\nDirector of Photography: Paolo Volont\u00e9\nEditing: Juan Gomez de Mello at Verano TV\nSound Engineers: Andrea Fognini, Davide Lasala\nMixing & Mastering: Tomi P\u00e9rez\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#fatoumatadiawara #nprmusic #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxfFYV4Lfek", "date_published": "2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tori Amos: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnn Powers | February 2, 2022\nTori Amos' Tiny Desk (home) concert debut takes place in what looks like close quarters. The singer-songwriter whose music has served as a beacon for so many listeners during her thirty-year career sits at her beloved Bosendorfer piano with a star-embellished Wurlitzer at her back. On a nearby shelf is a stack of books; one is Suzanne Simard's classic of forest ecology, Finding the Mother Tree. As Amos begins \"Baker Baker,\" a fan favorite from her 1994 album Under the Pink, her bell-like voice fills the room. It's easy to imagine she's in a lighthouse on the cliffs of Cornwall instead of the state-of-the-art home studio where her husband, engineer Mark Hawley, ensures that the mix will be perfect. This three-song performance shows Amos both alone and reaching out, casting sonic beams to guide us in the dark.\n\nThe other two songs Amos offers are from her characteristically fearless, self-interrogating, soul-integrating 2021 album Ocean to Ocean. Her renditions of the title track and \"29 Years\" are magnetic, but what really makes this set a treat is the commentary she shares before each song. Talking about the growing she's done during lockdown \u2013 learning about the climate crisis, confronting her own long-buried trauma \u2013 Amos reveals why she remains so beloved. She still knows how to make the most private and even inchoate feelings accessible. Hers is a lighthouse that welcomes the traveler in for a heart-to-heart exchange.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Baker Baker\"\n\"Ocean to Ocean\"\n\"29 Years\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTori Amos: vocals, keyboard\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Dave Meyers\nAudio: Mark Hawley\nAssistant Engineer: Adam Spry\nRecorded at Martian Engineering, Cornwall UK\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#toriamos #nprmusic #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufUZu4h_m8", "date_published": "2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
