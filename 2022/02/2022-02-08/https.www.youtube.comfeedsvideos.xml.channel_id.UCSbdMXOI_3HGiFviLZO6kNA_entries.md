Hello and welcome to, TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! This week was extremely turbulent for the entire VR industry. Meta loses 26% of it's market value, largely due to Apple's iOS changes, Reality Labs spending, and Facebook's growth stalling, Microsoft insiders detail turmoil within their mixed reality department, and Mozilla cancels their reality browser. We've got that and SO much more, hope you enjoy!
