Universal Control was announced at WWDC 2021 and missed the initial wave of version releases. Whatever the cause of the delay, it's finally here and it was totally worth the wait. In this video we demo How To Use Universal Control, how to setup Universal Control, what Universal Control does, but most importantly: what does Universal Control mean for the future of the iPad and the Mac? Is macOS and iPadOS going to merge? Is the Mac going to get a touchscreen? All of this and more coming soon.
