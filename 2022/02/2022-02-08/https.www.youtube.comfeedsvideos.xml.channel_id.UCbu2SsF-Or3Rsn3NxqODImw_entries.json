Since 2018, the team has made promises about the numerous narrative branches Dying Light 2 players would find in the game. Those branches are there, and they are indeed plentiful, but experiencing them felt equivalent to falling out of a tree and hitting my face on every branch on the way down. While Dying Light 2's most crucial element, first-person parkour, is certainly better than it's ever been in this massive sequel, much of the rest of the game fails to keep up.\n\nCheck out Mark Delaney's full written review:\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dying-light-2-review-look-before-you-leap/1900-6417819/\n\n#DyingLight2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvy4X7x5CpQ", "date_published": "2022-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes - Official HD Trailer | Nintendo Direct February 2022", "description": "Fire Emblem returns with Fire Emblem Warriors.

Exploring the Dreadnaught was the peak of the original Destiny, as it was both a horrifying place to find yourself trapped in, and a delightfully dense landscape full of mysteries to uncover. In the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion The Witch Queen, players are again delving into the throne world of a deadly Hive god. With Savathun's throne world, though, developer Bungie looks to be pushing even harder on creating a twisted locale filled with frightening threats and deadly secrets.\n\nWe recently got a chance to see about an hour of The Witch Queen in action during a hands-off preview, in which Bungie took us through the new destination, demonstrated some elements of the expansion's new story campaign, and showed how new things such as weapon crafting will work.\n\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:56 - Savathun's Throne World\n03:44 - The Campaign\n06:13 - Season of the Risen\n07:52 - Enclave & Weapon Crafting\n11:14 - Void 3.0\n13:02 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUud6SeNrDg", "date_published": "2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Lost Ark Developers React To Launch Issues | GameSpot News", "description": "Lost Ark suffers from issues on Steam, Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Season 2 details are revealed, and Fortnite\u2019s compatibility with Steam Deck becomes doubtful.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about Lost Ark players experiencing an issue with being able to download the game.
