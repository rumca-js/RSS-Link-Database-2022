Techland's undead sequel Dying Light 2 improves upon the strongest element of its predecessor, but things like story and characters drag it down.

When developer Techland added the subtitle "Stay Human" to Dying Light 2, it seemed to signal the team's intentions to rediscover (and showcase) the humanity nestled at the core of the story. Since 2018, the team has made promises about the numerous narrative branches Dying Light 2 players would find in the game. Those branches are there, and they are indeed plentiful, but experiencing them felt equivalent to falling out of a tree and hitting my face on every branch on the way down. While Dying Light 2's most crucial element, first-person parkour, is certainly better than it's ever been in this massive sequel, much of the rest of the game fails to keep up.

## Destiny 2: The Witch Queen & Season of the Risen Preview

Phil Hornshaw got an early preview at Destiny 2's upcoming Witch Queen expansion, including a look at the campaign, weapon crafting, and Void 3.0.

Some of the best environments that have ever existed in the Destiny world appeared in the Dreadnaught--the massive warship, dungeon, and personal hellscape of Oryx, the Taken King. Exploring the Dreadnaught was the peak of the original Destiny, as it was both a horrifying place to find yourself trapped in, and a delightfully dense landscape full of mysteries to uncover. In the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion The Witch Queen, players are again delving into the throne world of a deadly Hive god. With Savathun's throne world, though, developer Bungie looks to be pushing even harder on creating a twisted locale filled with frightening threats and deadly secrets.

We recently got a chance to see about an hour of The Witch Queen in action during a hands-off preview, in which Bungie took us through the new destination, demonstrated some elements of the expansion's new story campaign, and showed how new things such as weapon crafting will work.
