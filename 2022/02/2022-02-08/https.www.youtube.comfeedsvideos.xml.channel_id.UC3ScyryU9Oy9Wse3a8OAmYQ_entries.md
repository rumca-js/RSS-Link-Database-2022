In “Confronting ISIS,” veteran FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith (“The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia” “Bitter Rivals: Iran and Saudi Arabia”) traveled to five countries with key roles in the anti-ISIS fight — Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Turkey — to report on successes, failures and challenges as ISIS lost ground in the region but conducted attacks abroad. Beginning with the fall of Mosul to ISIS in 2014, this two-hour special deeply examines two years of American-led efforts to defeat ISIS, taking viewers step-by-step through a number of initiatives involving different regional players.
