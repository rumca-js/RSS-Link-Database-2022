Ivermectin Arm of PRINCIPLE Trial Put on Hold?

MedPage Today, Merck
"concluded that the probability of ivermectin providing a potentially safe and efficacious treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infection is low and have prioritized internal efforts towards the development of alternate candidates that provide a higher probability of success for the treatment of COVID-19."
"If clinical data emerge providing definitive evidence for a positive benefit-risk assessment of the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, we stand ready to provide our expertise and resources as needed,"

Professor Chris Butler, from the University Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, 

Joint Chief Investigator of the PRINCIPLE trial, said, 

‘Ivermectin is readily available globally, 

has been in wide use for many other infectious conditions so it’s a well-known medicine with a good safety profile, 

and because of the early promising results in some studies it is already being widely used to treat COVID-19 in several countries.

A double blind trial

Independent Data Monitoring and Safety Committee

Will pick up a signal for futility, superiority, or safety

Will let the Trial Steering Committee know

Then a final analysis can be conducted, followed by the release of results and data

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)

Highly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2

Multiple reports of widespread spillover from humans to free-living deer

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron variant

Staten Island, New York, December 12th 2021 to January 31st 2022

White-tailed deer opportunistically sampled on Staten

19 of the 131 (14.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2

P.C.R. testing, n = 68 deer

Seven actively infected at the time of sampling

Specific serum antibodies indicating prior exposure 
(? Omicron or previous)

Whole-genome sequencing identified Omicron (n = 4)

Circulating amongst the white-tailed deer on Staten Island

Phylogenetic Omicron sequences clustered closely with sequences recovered from infected humans in New York

Human to deer spillover

Urgent need for comprehensive surveillance of susceptible animal species,

to identify ecological transmission networks
 
and better assess the potential risks of spillback to humans

Virus may be evolving to adapt to the new host

Infected with earlier variants

Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia

(Deer have appeared asymptomatic when infected with earlier variants)
