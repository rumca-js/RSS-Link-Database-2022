Elden Ring file size and preloading are confirmed on Xbox consoles, Activision gives an update on Call of Duty anti-cheat, and EA responds to reports that Halo Infinite hurt Battlefield 2042. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Elden Ring’s file size and preloading, which is currently live for Xbox players. A preload date hasn't been announced yet for PlayStation consoles or PC. Elden Ring releases on February 25, 2022 for PlayStation, Xbox and PC. 

DeVante also talks about reports that said the launch of Halo Infinite might have contributed to the lower-than-expected results. Fans may recall that Microsoft surprise-launched Halo Infinite's multiplayer on November 15, just days before Battlefield 2042. 

Later in the video, he explains a new blog post from Activision that said cheating within Warzone reached an "all-time low" during the holidays, speaking to the success of the Ricochet tools.

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with patch 1.5. Lucy and Jean-Luc dive into if the game is finally in the bug-free and fully playable state it should have been at launch, as well as touch on added features like new apartments and weapons.

The next-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077 come with both a performance and ray tracing mode, giving players the option for 60fps or 30fps with ray-traced shadows. It also features another round of bug fixes. While the game still isn't perfect, the game's current state feels more than acceptable, and we feel confident in saying that Cyberpunk is finally in a good playable state for players to enjoy. Patch 1.5 also features some more dramatic gameplay changes like new skills, a rebalanced economy, the option to change your appearance after the start, and even new apartments for V to rent. Only time will tell where Cyberpunk will go from here but for now it's nice to just sit back and experience the game for what it is.

How much better does the next-gen version really look? More than you might except.

CD Projekt RED dropped the surprise bombshell that is Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.5 Patch on Tuesday. This not only included a host of improvements and gameplay tweaks, but also marked the release of the long awaited next-gen versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The new versions include a performance mode that runs at 60fps at a dynamic 4K, as well as a ray tracing mode that includes ray traced shadows at 30fps dynamic 4K.

In this video we compare the PS4 Pro version of Cyberpunk running on a PS5 with patch 1.31, vs the native PS5 version running on the new 1.5 patch. Even without the ray traced shadows there is a noticeable difference between the two versions, with updated lighting, higher res textures, and even better model detail. It's nice to see more than just a simple resolution and frame rate bump with these next-generation versions.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Elden Ring spoilers emerging online, confirmation of the Metro’s fate in Cyberpunk 2077, and more. 

While Elden Ring has a planned launch of February 25, some players have managed to get their copies just over a week early, and are streaming the game on Twitch. Not only that, but the game's intro cinematic has been released early, alongside some screengrabs and gameplay features.

Now that players have had some time with Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.5 patch, they’re starting to discover all types of new secrets under the hood. However, a screenshot shared on reddit of an existing asset had the Metro discussion circulating again. Cyberpunk 2077’s Global Community Director, Marcin Momot, was quick to clarify on twitter that there will definitely not be a Metro added to the game and the screenshot that was circulating was completely unrelated.

A new patch for Dying Light 2 has gone live on PC, and between a few tweaks to the zombie apocalypse sandbox, one of the game's more annoying bugs has been fixed. Dying during a quest within a restricted area would result in them being respawned in a different area, and facing a time limit that would not allow them to get back to the previous mission area on time. That issue has been fixed, alongside a few others.
