California, SMARTER Plan
https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/smarterplan.pdf

The release of the California SMARTER Plan: The Next Phase of California’s COVID-19 Response

It is clear the virus will remain with us for some time, if not forever. 

However, we know what works, and have built the necessary tools over the last two years that allows us to learn and hone our defenses to this virus as it evolves.
 
As we enter the next phase with COVID-19, which may include future surges and new variants, 

In our approach to this next phase, we will be smarter than ever before, using the lessons of the last two years to approach mitigation and adaptation measures

This includes vaccines, masks, tests, quarantine, improving ventilation, and new therapeutics. 

But California’s path forward will also be predicated on our individual, smarter actions, that will collectively yield better outcomes for our neighborhoods, communities, and state. 

 Shots- Vaccines are the most powerful weapon against hospitalization and serious illness. 
Masks- Properly worn masks with good filtration help slow the spread of COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses. 
Awareness- We will continue to stay aware of how COVID-19 is spreading, evolving variants, communicate clearly how people should protect themselves, and coordinate our state and local government response. 
Readiness- COVID-19 isn’t going away and we need to be ready with the tools, resources and supplies we will need to quickly respond and keep public health and the health care system well prepared. 
Testing- Getting the right type of tests - PCR or antigen - to where they are needed most. Testing will help California minimize the spread of COVID-19. 
Education- California will continue to work to keep schools open and children safely in classrooms for in-person instruction. 
Rx- Evolving and improving treatments will become increasingly available and critical as a tool to save lives. 

Zoe data

UK R = 0.9

England, 0.9
Wales, 1.0
Scotland, 1.1

Prevalence

UK,1 in 25 have symptomatic COVID

ONS, 1 in 20 in England

At least 36.7% of cold-like symptoms are likely to have symptomatic COVID-19

Professor Tim Spector

cases remain historically high with one in 25 people currently having COVID,

and numbers still increasing in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

hospital and ICU admissions are very low, 

the ZOE data doesn’t yet suggest that we’ve entered a stable or endemic phase. 

déjà vu

my advice is we should all still be self isolating for five days from first new symptoms, when infectiousness is high

NSW Government update to COVID-19 settings

https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/nsw-government-update-to-covid-19-settings

Easing of restrictions, 18th and 25th February

Hospitalisation and ICU rates easing

Booster uptake now above 50%

Staged return of non-urgent elective surgery across all NSW public hospitals

Minister for Health Brad Hazzard

As we are moving more into the endemic stage of the COVID-19 pandemic,

The best outcome is still to avoid getting the virus by protecting yourself, your family, and the broader community

Novavax – first protein vaccine now available

https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-statement-on-the-use-of-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-nuvaxovid

Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation

ATAGI recommends that Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be used for the primary course of COVID-19 vaccination in people aged 18 or older.

Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to pregnant and breastfeeding women. 

People with severe immunocompromise are recommended to receive 3 primary doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be used

Heterologous use

not currently recommended for use as a booster vaccine

can be co-administered with other vaccines if required.

Myocarditis

it is not possible to determine if there is a causal relationship or to estimate the risk of myocarditis associated with this vaccine. 

It is recommended that all COVID-19 vaccine recipients should be aware of the potential signs and symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis, and should be counselled about when to seek medical attention.

Is the vaccine interval advice in the United States sub-optimal, increasing myocarditis?

JCVI updates advice on vaccinations for 5 to 11 age group

December 22nd JCVI recommended the vaccine be offered to at-risk 5 to 11 year olds,

rollout of which officially began at the beginning of February

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-updates-advice-on-vaccinations-for-5-to-11-age-group

5 million

Although this age group is generally at very low risk of serious illness from the virus, 

a very small number of children who get infected do develop severe disease.

Latest evidence suggests that offering the vaccine ahead of another potential wave,

will protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation,

and will also provide some short-term protection against mild infection across the age group.

The committee has therefore advised

a non-urgent offer to all 5 to 11 year olds of 2 (10mcg) doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech paediatric vaccine. 

The 2 doses should be given with an interval of at least 12 weeks between doses.

International data from adult programmes

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old

a longer interval between doses 

(greater than the 3 to 4-week schedule widely used in the United States)

is associated with a lower reporting rate of myocarditis following vaccination. 

This association is expected to also apply to the paediatric dose and formulation when used in children.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 immunisation on the JCVI

The main purpose of offering vaccination to 5 to 11 year olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of COVID-19.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England will advise on their plans for operationalising the latest JCVI recommendations in due course.

Professor Paul Hunter

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/02/09/uk-past-point-covid-vaccinations-children-will-make-difference/

I would lean against offering it to this age group for a number of reasons

they are actually falling really quickly at the moment

and we’re seeing fewer than half the cases in this age group than we saw in little more than a week ago

The only reason why they were given it was to hopefully protect them against disruption to schooling

and we haven’t seen that vaccines have done a huge amount to stop those interruptions

Mr Javid

The NHS will prepare to extend this non-urgent offer to all children during April so parents can, if they want, take up the offer to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19 as we learn to live with this virus

 

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old

It is estimated that over 85% of all children aged 5 to 11 will have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection by the end of January 2022,

with roughly half of these infections due to the Omicron variant. 

Natural immunity arising from prior infection will contribute towards protection against future infection and severe disease.

use of the Pfizer-BioNTech 10 mcg paediatric formulation vaccine should be encouraged for all pupils in the relevant academic year for children aged 11 to 12 to reduce complexity in programme delivery and expected reactogenic events for individuals

This advice on the offer of vaccination to 5 to 11-year olds who are not in a clinical risk group is considered by JCVI as a one-off pandemic response programme. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic moves further towards endemicity in the UK, 

JCVI will review whether, in the longer term, an offer of vaccination to this, and other paediatric age groups, continues to be advised.
