It also features another round of bug fixes. While the game still isn't perfect, the game's current state feels more than acceptable, and we feel confident in saying that Cyberpunk is finally in a good playable state for players to enjoy. Patch 1.5 also features some more dramatic gameplay changes like new skills, a rebalanced economy, the option to change your appearance after the start, and even new apartments for V to rent. Only time will tell where Cyberpunk will go from here but for now it's nice to just sit back and experience the game for what it is.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:02 - PlayStation 5 Version\n05:38 - PC Version\n06:39 - Quality of Life Improvements\n09:27 - Are There Still Bugs?\n10:24 - Skills & Apartments\n11:19 - What's The Future For Cyberpunk?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eeZiVJP33k", "date_published": "2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rainbow Six Extraction - Spillover Crisis Event Gameplay", "description": "Rainbow Six Extraction is having it's first post-launch, limited time event- Spillover.

The new versions include a performance mode that runs at 60fps at a dynamic 4K, as well as a ray tracing mode that includes ray traced shadows at 30fps dynamic 4K.\n\nIn this video we compare the PS4 Pro version of Cyberpunk running on a PS5 with patch 1.31, vs the native PS5 version running on the new 1.5 patch. Even without the ray traced shadows there is a noticeable difference between the two versions, with updated lighting, higher res textures, and even better model detail. It's nice to see more than just a simple resolution and frame rate bump with these next-generation versions.\n\n#Cyberpunk2077", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofw_PfDolCg", "date_published": "2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Secrets Being Found | GameSpot News", "description": "In today\u2019s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about some of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new secrets being revealed, No Man\u2019s Sky Sentinel update out now, and more. \n\nDuring CD Projekt Red\u2019s 1.5 patch reveal stream, it was also mentioned that there would be some new secrets for players to discover throughout the game with clips emerging online showcasing new police chases, character before & afters, character balance changes, and more. \n\nHello Games has just dropped the Sentinel update for No Man\u2019s Sky.
