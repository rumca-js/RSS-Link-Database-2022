Testing will help California minimize the spread of COVID-19. \nEducation- California will continue to work to keep schools open and children safely in classrooms for in-person instruction. \nRx- Evolving and improving treatments will become increasingly available and critical as a tool to save lives. \n\nZoe data\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com\n\nUK R = 0.9\n\nEngland, 0.9\nWales, 1.0\nScotland, 1.1\n\nPrevalence\n\nUK,1 in 25 have symptomatic COVID\n\nONS, 1 in 20 in England\n\nAt least 36.7% of cold-like symptoms are likely to have symptomatic COVID-19\n\nProfessor Tim Spector\n\ncases remain historically high with one in 25 people currently having COVID,\n\nand numbers still increasing in Scotland and Northern Ireland. \n\nhospital and ICU admissions are very low, \n\nthe ZOE data doesn\u2019t yet suggest that we\u2019ve entered a stable or endemic phase. \n\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\nmy advice is we should all still be self isolating for five days from first new symptoms, when infectiousness is high\n\nNSW Government update to COVID-19 settings\n\nhttps://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/nsw-government-update-to-covid-19-settings\n\nEasing of restrictions, 18th and 25th February\n\nHospitalisation and ICU rates easing\n\nBooster uptake now above 50%\n\nStaged return of non-urgent elective surgery across all NSW public hospitals\n\nMinister for Health Brad Hazzard\n\nAs we are moving more into the endemic stage of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\nThe best outcome is still to avoid getting the virus by protecting yourself, your family, and the broader community\n\nNovavax \u2013 first protein vaccine now available\n\nhttps://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/novavax-first-protein-vaccine-now-available\n\nhttps://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-statement-on-the-use-of-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-nuvaxovid\n\nAustralian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation\n\nATAGI recommends that Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be used for the primary course of COVID-19 vaccination in people aged 18 or older.\n\nNovavax COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to pregnant and breastfeeding women. \n\nPeople with severe immunocompromise are recommended to receive 3 primary doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be used\n\nHeterologous use\n\nnot currently recommended for use as a booster vaccine\n\ncan be co-administered with other vaccines if required.\n\nMyocarditis\n\nit is not possible to determine if there is a causal relationship or to estimate the risk of myocarditis associated with this vaccine. \n\nIt is recommended that all COVID-19 vaccine recipients should be aware of the potential signs and symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis, and should be counselled about when to seek medical attention.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfcSGoTUu7Y", "date_published": "2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Natural immunity with Dr Pilz", "description": "Direct link to paper, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35149106/\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfections: Overview of efficacy and duration of natural and hybrid immunity\n\nDr Stefan Pilz, MD, PhD.

recommended the vaccine be offered to at-risk 5 to 11 year olds,\n\nrollout of which officially began at the beginning of February\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-updates-advice-on-vaccinations-for-5-to-11-age-group\n\n5 million\n\nAlthough this age group is generally at very low risk of serious illness from the virus, \n\na very small number of children who get infected do develop severe disease.\n\nLatest evidence suggests that offering the vaccine ahead of another potential wave,\n\nwill protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation,\n\nand will also provide some short-term protection against mild infection across the age group.\n\nThe committee has therefore advised\n\na non-urgent offer to all 5 to 11 year olds of 2 (10mcg) doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech paediatric vaccine. \n\nThe 2 doses should be given with an interval of at least 12 weeks between doses.\n\nInternational data from adult programmes\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old\n\na longer interval between doses \n\n(greater than the 3 to 4-week schedule widely used in the United States)\n\nis associated with a lower reporting rate of myocarditis following vaccination. \n\nThis association is expected to also apply to the paediatric dose and formulation when used in children.\n\nProfessor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 immunisation on the JCVI\n\nThe main purpose of offering vaccination to 5 to 11 year olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of COVID-19.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England will advise on their plans for operationalising the latest JCVI recommendations in due course.\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/02/09/uk-past-point-covid-vaccinations-children-will-make-difference/\n\nI would lean against offering it to this age group for a number of reasons\n\nthey are actually falling really quickly at the moment\n\nand we\u2019re seeing fewer than half the cases in this age group than we saw in little more than a week ago\n\nThe only reason why they were given it was to hopefully protect them against disruption to schooling\n\nand we haven\u2019t seen that vaccines have done a huge amount to stop those interruptions\n\nMr Javid\n\nThe NHS will prepare to extend this non-urgent offer to all children during April so parents can, if they want, take up the offer to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19 as we learn to live with this virus\n\n \n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old\n\nIt is estimated that over 85% of all children aged 5 to 11 will have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection by the end of January 2022,\n\nwith roughly half of these infections due to the Omicron variant. \n\nNatural immunity arising from prior infection will contribute towards protection against future infection and severe disease.\n\nuse of the Pfizer-BioNTech 10 mcg paediatric formulation vaccine should be encouraged for all pupils in the relevant academic year for children aged 11 to 12 to reduce complexity in programme delivery and expected reactogenic events for individuals\n\nThis advice on the offer of vaccination to 5 to 11-year olds who are not in a clinical risk group is considered by JCVI as a one-off pandemic response programme. \n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic moves further towards endemicity in the UK, \n\nJCVI will review whether, in the longer term, an offer of vaccination to this, and other paediatric age groups, continues to be advised.\n\nONS\n\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/antibodies\n\n10 January to 17 January,
