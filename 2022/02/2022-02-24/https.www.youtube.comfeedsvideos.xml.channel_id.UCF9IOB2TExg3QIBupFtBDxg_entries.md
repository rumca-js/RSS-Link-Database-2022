Yes you can but the chance is only 1 in 38,279 infections

Occurrence and significance of 

Omicron BA.1 infection followed by BA.2 reinfection

Omicron carries numerous mutations in key regions and is associated with increased transmissibility and immune escape. 

Omicron BA.1 and BA.2

Whether BA.2 specifically can escape the natural immunity acquired shortly after a BA.1 infection

N = 1,8 million infections

November 22, 2021, until February 11, 2022

Individuals with two positive samples, more than 20 and less than 60 days apart

From a total of 187 reinfection cases, we identified 47 instances of BA.2 reinfections shortly after a BA.1 infection, 

(So from 1,800,000 million, 47 did and 1,799.853 didnâ€™t)
 
mostly in young unvaccinated individuals with mild disease not resulting in hospitalization or death.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that Omicron BA.2 reinfections do occur shortly after BA.1 infections but are rare.

## Is new omicron more severe?

From Danish data, no, but more younger people are admitted to hospital

Risk assessment of Omicron BA.2 

https://en.ssi.dk/-/media/arkiv/subsites/covid19/risikovurderinger/2022/risk-assesment-of-omicron-ba2.pdf?la=en

The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has quickly become dominant in many countries,

significantly higher growth potential than the Delta variant
 
Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant

Secondary Attack Rate

BA.1 29%

BA.2 39% 

and it has shown reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. 

Vaccine induced protection against infection is also clearly reduced for the Omicron compared to the Delta variant. 

Transmissibility is lower in fully vaccinated individuals and even lower in booster vaccinated individuals, compared to unvaccinated

Preliminary analyses

a 36%-80% risk reduction in hospitalization for the Omicron compared with the Delta

with most studies reporting a risk reduction between 45%-68%. 

Omicron

Lineages B.1.1.529, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. BA.1 

accounts for 97% of omicron worldwide

Denmark

Week 52, 2021, 20%

Week 3, 2022, 66%

an increase in the proportion of BA.2 and a decrease in the proportion of BA.1

BA.2 is probably beginning to take over in India, Philippines, European countries

Qatar, BA.2 seems to be dominant

Increased growth potential

Higher transmissibility and/or 
increased ability to evade the immune system compared to BA.1. 

Current knowledge about severity 

no difference in hospital admission risk was detected for BA.1 and BA.2
(n = 932 patients)

BA,1 median age of hospital admission, 51

BA,2 median age of hospital admission, 40

## US vaccine intervals increased

Considerations for intervals for mRNA COVID-19 vaccine primary series

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#primary-series

An 8-week interval may be optimal for some people ages 12 years and older, especially for males ages 12 to 39 years.

While absolute risk remains small, the relative risk for myocarditis is higher for males ages 12-39 years, 

and this risk might be reduced by extending the interval between the first and second dose

Peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased with an interval longer than 4 weeks.

Lift most of remaining restrictions on March 1

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki 

Deaths and hospitalizations, Omicron variant, lower than anticipated,

Encouraging trends made the risk of shifting to an endemic approach worthwhile

Cases, + 20,456 30% down on the week

Fully vaccinated 58%

Germany

March 20th most restrictions go

UK

HMQ, cancelled events

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

Week ending 19 February 2022 

2,096,200 people (1 in 25) in England

98,200 people (1 in 30) in Wales

132,700 people (1 in 14) in Northern Ireland

240,700 people (1 in 20) in Scotland

The rate of reinfections sharply increased

The reinfection rate increased from 11.7 to 141.1 per 100,000 people since the Omicron variant became most common.

The risk of reinfection was ten times higher when the Omicron variant was most common (20 December 2021 to 6 February 2022) 

compared with when the Delta variant was most common (17 May 2021 to 19 December 2021)

People who had their second vaccine dose over 90 days ago were more likely to be reinfected than people who had it 14 to 89 days ago.
