The patch promises some fixes to various bugs and slight tweaks to elements like player controls and game balance.\n\nSome of the other fixes mentioned were various text and balance adjustments, NPC event fixes, and more.

Though you can certainly build your character into whatever you want them to be, the 10 starting classes provide you with upfront boosts to specific stats that benefit particular playstyles. In addition, you\u2019ll start off with gear and potentially spells that match said playstyle.\n\nIn this video guide, we walk through each of Elden Ring's starting classes and discuss the benefits of each in the early game. From the Hero class, which is a good melee-focused all-rounder, to the Confessor, a hybrid class that has a lot of points in strength, dexterity, and faith, meaning you can cast incantations without sacrificing melee capabilities. Or, if you truly love pain (and building your character from scratch), you could pick the Wretch, the Elden Ring equivalent of Dark Souls' Deprived class. \n\nWe have a separate video to help you begin your journey in Elden Ring, with our beginner's guide to the game, as well as more guide content, so make sure you subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out the written versions on gamespot.com.
