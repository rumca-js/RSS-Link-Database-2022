Since 2018, the team has made promises about the numerous narrative branches Dying Light 2 players would find in the game. Those branches are there, and they are indeed plentiful, but experiencing them felt equivalent to falling out of a tree and hitting my face on every branch on the way down. While Dying Light 2's most crucial element, first-person parkour, is certainly better than it's ever been in this massive sequel, much of the rest of the game fails to keep up.\n\nCheck out Mark Delaney's full written review:\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dying-light-2-review-look-before-you-leap/1900-6417819/\n\n#DyingLight2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvy4X7x5CpQ", "date_published": "2022-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes - Official HD Trailer | Nintendo Direct February 2022", "description": "Fire Emblem returns with Fire Emblem Warriors.
