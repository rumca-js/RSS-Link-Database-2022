released\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVpxiFh6oaY&t=0s\n\nDiscover is finally starting a redesign.\nhttps://pointieststick.com/2022/02/04/this-week-in-kde-discover-redesign-has-begun/\n\nAnd still on KDE Plasma, Plasma Mobile Gear 22.02 has been released.\nhttps://plasma-mobile.org/2022/02/09/plasma-mobile-gear-22-02/\n\nPeppermint OS is back from its hiatus.\nhttps://peppermintos.com/2022/02/peppermint-release-notes/\n\nSystem 76 has released an update to their PopOS distribution for more FPS\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/pop-os-linux-gets-better-game-performance-and-desktop-responsiveness/\n\nUbuntu 22.04 may offer accent colors.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/02/ubuntu-22-04-accent-colors\n\nGNOME 42 still holds a bunch of new things in store, and the latest one seems to be the support for dark wallpapers\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/02/gnomr-42-dark-background-preference\n\nFalkon, the web browser made for KDE, got a new release, version 3.2.\nhttps://www.falkon.org/2022/01/31/320-released/\n\nSystem76 released their Kudu laptop, which is a very, very thicc boy.\nhttps://system76.com/laptops/kudu\n\nChristian Schaller, the director for Desktop at Red Hat, wrote an interesting blog post about \"use case Linux distros\", which basically means distributions made to answer a specific use case.\nhttps://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/02/01/getting-rid-of-the-need-for-the-usecase-linux-distribution/\n\nSpeaking of usecase distros, Zorin OS 16 Education was released.\nhttps://blog.zorin.com/2022/02/03/zorin-os-16-education-is-released/\n\nCodeweavers is looking for programmers, full time, to improve Wine, CrossOver, Proton.\nhttps://www.codeweavers.com/about/jobs\n\nThe Steam Deck is being revealed bit by bit, and it seems that AMD's super sampling technology, called AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, or FSR, is being added to SteamOS's compositor, Gamescope\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-comes-to-gamescope-for-the-steam-deck/\n\nReviewers have started putting the Deck through its paces, and we got some nice benchmarks.\nhttps://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-benchmarks-battery-life-and-more/\n\nSpeaking of which, there are now 243 games that are verified on the Deck, and 412 games in total if you also include the \"Playable\" titles.\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-verified-jumps-over-200-titles/\n\nAnd finally, let's stay on Gaming, with Tim Sweeeny, CEO of Epic games, stating on Twitter that Easy Anti Cheat isn't good enough in terms of Proton support, to enable Fortnite to use it.
