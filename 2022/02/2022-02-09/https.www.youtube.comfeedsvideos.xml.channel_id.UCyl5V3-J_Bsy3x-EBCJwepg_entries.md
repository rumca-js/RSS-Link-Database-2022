Greg Gutfeld, the new king of Late Night, joins Kyle and Adam to talk about how he is destroying all the other Late Night hosts, cancel culture, and why he continues to call Brian Stelter fat. Greg never planned on working in Late Night. He first started writing in the magazine world then working his way up into shows on Fox before landing on his current show, Gutfeld! Greg is bringing his live shows to new cities. Check out the links below for how to get FREE tickets.
