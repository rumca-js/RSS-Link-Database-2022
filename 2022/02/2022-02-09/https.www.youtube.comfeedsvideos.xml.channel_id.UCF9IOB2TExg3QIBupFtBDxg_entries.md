Professor Chris Butler, from the University Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, 

Joint Chief Investigator of the PRINCIPLE trial, said, 

‘Ivermectin is readily available globally, 

has been in wide use for many other infectious conditions so it’s a well-known medicine with a good safety profile, 

and because of the early promising results in some studies it is already being widely used to treat COVID-19 in several countries.
