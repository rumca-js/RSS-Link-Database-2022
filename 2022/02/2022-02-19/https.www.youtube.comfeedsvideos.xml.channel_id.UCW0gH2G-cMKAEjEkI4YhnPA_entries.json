We now know that The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim Anime will release on April 12, 2024.  We also got our first look at two pieces of concept art from the film and a slew of confirmations of who is involved.  We already knew that anime director Kenji Kamiyama was on board, but we also learned of the involvement of Alan Lee, John Howe, Sir Richard Taylor, WETA, and Philippa Boyens!
