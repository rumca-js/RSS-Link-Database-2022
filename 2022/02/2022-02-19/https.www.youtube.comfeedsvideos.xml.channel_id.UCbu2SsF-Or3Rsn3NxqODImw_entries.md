Whenever a game or movie needs to dial up the action, the roar of the Minigun is there, whether it’s mounted to a Battlefield helicopter or clutched in the arms of a T-800 Terminator. From Call of Duty set-pieces to Predator-hunting mercenaries, it’s a must-have for any larger-than-life action hero, so with its colossal reputation and a history spanning centuries, why do movies and video games keep getting the spinning maw of the Minigun so wrong? (Presented by PUBG MOBILE)

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to discover the surprising origins of the M134 Minigun, and see why it’s one of the least well-represented guns in pop culture history.

Don't worry. We've been playing Bungie's pinnacle loot shooter and have a comprehensive catch-up guide for all new and returning players alike, eager to play Destiny with the upcoming launch of The Witch Queen!

Destiny 2 is a constantly evolving game, so if you haven’t touched it even as far back as the Shadowkeep expansion when it went free-to-play, it might be quite different from what you remember. Whether you're a new player or a returning one, we got you! We breakdown everything from what expansions you need to worry about buying, to how seasons work, and armor builds and exotic tips, just to name a few. 

The Witch Queen is at max hype right now, and this story is about to be incredible with all the build-up over the last 7 years from Destiny 1 coming to this moment. If Lightfall is like Avenger’s Endgame, then Witch Queen certainly feels like Infinity War, and I’m 100% here for it. Trust me, if you haven’t played yet or you fell off, I’m sorry to say that you missed out on some really cool shared experiences but that’s ok! Because you’re back now, and there’s, even more, to discover and experience together, and that’s all that matters. See you on the field, Guardian.

Uncharted is an iconic franchise, a game that is firmly cemented to a whole family of consoles and a series that helped shape a studio’s development and storytelling, but our Dave Jewitt has never played it!
Does the game stand the test of time? Is it worth exploiting for new players? Do enemies ever run out of grenades? Dave has to answer all these questions and more.

## Uncharted Movie Post-Credits & Game References Explained

While the Uncharted movie largely charts its own path with an original story different to Naughty Dog’s game series, there are a handful of easter eggs and game references for eagle-eyed fans to keep a lookout for. And not only that, but it ends with a post-credits sting that teases a sequel that might actually follow the games a lot more closely.

07:16 - Ending

In the post-credits scene we see Nathan Drake and Sully meet with a shady-looking, eyepatch-sporting Pilou Asbaek, and they’re discussing their potential next big job, which Sully says could be the big one. There’s mention of a Nazi treasure map and another character simply called Roman - both of which are pretty solid references to the very first game in the franchise, Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 

In that game, Nate, Sully and Elena Fisher - Nate’s future wife - search for the lost treasure of El Dorado, and encounter - among other things - a Nazi U-boat in the jungle, as well as a German U-boat station in a race against rival treasure hunter, Gabriel Roman - potentially the Roman who’s namechecked in this scene.
