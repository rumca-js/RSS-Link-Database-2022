Cases of this severe disease in children are very low in omicron times

MIS-C COVID

Overall cases in children this year, 4.6 million

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome


What is MIS?

MIS is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs.

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/02/22/health/mis-c-omicron-waiting-for-trouble/index.html

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#mis-national-surveillance

Total MIS-C cases, 6,851

Deaths, 59

Child cases, 12.5 million since start of pandemic

Children, 0.00%-0.25% of all COVID-19 deaths

https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/


The median age 9 years

Half of children with MIS-C were between the ages of 5 and 13 years.

60% of reported patients were male.

59% of the reported patients Hispanic/Latino or black

Black, 2,050 

Hispanic/Latino, 1,746

98% of patients had a positive test result for SARS CoV-2

2% of patients had contact with someone with COVID-19

MIS-C can occur weeks after COVID-19 and even if the child or family did not know the child had COVID-19.

Clinical Criteria

Fever, ≥38.0 C) for ≥24 hours

Shock or hypotension

Severe cardiac illness

myocarditis, pericarditis, coronary artery dilatation/aneurysm
new-onset right or left ventricular dysfunction
2nd/3rd degree A-V block
ventricular tachycardia

Rash AND non-purulent conjunctivitis

New-onset neurologic signs and symptoms

Encephalopathy, seizures, meningeal signs, or peripheral neuropathy (including Guillain-Barré syndrome) 

Abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea

Thrombocytopenia

Elevated inflammatory markers

A positive SARS-CoV-2 test for current or recent infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen detection

Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, Infectious Disease Division chief at Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC

It always follows the same pattern

It's always two to six weeks after we see the spike from whatever variant it is,

and then we're on the lookout for MIS-C. And then, sure enough, it comes."

some of the MIS-C patients have been vaccinated, but the vast majority are not

we thought we may see an uptick with Omicron, but we haven't. 

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Dr. Marian Michaels

Luckily, in our area we are not seeing a surge

I'm very grateful

Seattle Children's Dr. Michael Portman, director of research in the Division of Cardiology

More MIS-C cases since mid-December 2021

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.023251

most children with MIS-C begin recovering in the first week after hospital discharge and fully recover heart function within three months

Do you also have significant protection even after previous asymptomatic infection?

Stefan’s original paper

Question 1: Do you also have a significant protection against reinfections when your first SARS-CoV-2 infection was asymptomatic?

Answer: Yes

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac034/6509535?redirectedFrom=PDF

Accepted article, Clinical Infectious Diseases

Reinfection with delta data

Previous infection reduced hospitalizations by 85%

Effectiveness against symptomatic reinfection

Protection from symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection

Symptomatic previous infection, 92.9% protection

Asymptomatic previous infection, 85.9% protection

both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection appear to provide strong protection against future severe disease.

These data are extremely important as so many infections are asymptomatic

 
Question 2: Are the data on natural immunity also valid for the Omicron variant?

Answer: Yes, (Letter to NEJM)
Protection against the Omicron Variant from Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Qatar

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2200133

In addition, we performed
sensitivity analyses that included adjustment for vaccination status and that excluded vaccinated persons from the analysis.

Protection against reinfections is moderately lower for the Omicron variant

The effectiveness of previous infection in preventing reinfection was estimated to be 

90.2% against the alpha variant 

85.7% against the beta variant, 

92.0% against the delta variant, and 

56.0%magainst the omicron variant

Protection against severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 is similar as for other variants

The effectiveness with respect to
severe, critical, or fatal Covid-19

69.4% against the alpha variant, 

88.0% against the beta variant

95% to 100% against the delta variant

87.8% against the omicron variant

The median interval between previous infection and PCR testing

254 days to 376 days

Question 3: Is Omicron really not so mild?

NEJM, Challenges in Inferring Intrinsic Severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2119682

South Africa

Answer: According to data from individuals who remained unvaccinated and did not have a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, 

the severity in terms of causing hospitalization was about 75% of the Delta variant.

Viruses don’t inevitably evolve toward being less virulent; 

evolution simply selects those that excel at multiplying. 

In the case of Covid-19, in which the vast majority of transmission occurs before disease becomes severe, 

reduced severity may not be directly selected for at all. 

Indeed, previous SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility (e.g., alpha and delta) 

appear to have greater intrinsic severity than their immediate ancestors or the previously dominant variant.
