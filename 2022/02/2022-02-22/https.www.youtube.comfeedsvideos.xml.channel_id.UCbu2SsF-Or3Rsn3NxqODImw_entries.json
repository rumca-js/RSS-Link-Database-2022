R. Martin.  #eldenring \n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the impact From Software has had on gaming. From birthing its own genre to acting as the inspiration for countless developers, the studio\u2019s games have not only left their mark on how games are designed but also how players interact with them. To celebrate the release of the studio\u2019s latest title, Elden Ring, here\u2019s the history of Soulsborne games.\n\nIn the above video, we chart the history of From Software, and how Hidetaka Miyazaki took its games in bold new directions. Beginning with King's Field, the spiritual predecessor to the Souls games and then charting the course of the series from there. We also take an in-depth look at the creation of Demon's Souls and the daring ideas that Miyakazi brought to the game, which Sony deemed too difficult, and bombed at release, before coming a cult hit in the West. From there, we take a look at the enormous success of Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Dark Souls III, and the communities that sprung up to mine every last secret from the games. While we don't linger too long on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, as it's not typically considered a Soulsborne game, we do delve into Bloodborne, and chart the evolution of From Software's approach to game design and how it's changed over the years in the lead up to Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring launches on February 25, 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Join Lucy James as she explains the game's ending, as well as what the future may hold for the next Horizon title.\n\nFive years and one DLC later, Horizon Forbidden West has arrived along with its massive follow up story. If you're feeling a little behind after your journey through the Forbidden West, fear not. Lucy James is here to break down the ending and even discuss what may happen next. \n\nEven after an incredibly vast story, Horizon Forbidden West has loose ends involving everything from main characters, to the future world Aloy and company fought to save.

The far Zenith lost their chance to rule the forbidden west, and doing so leave Aloy and crew to fix Gaia AND implement Elizabet Sobek's plan to restart society on earth as it once was. Sylens is seen ready to leave earth and start anew on an all new terraformed planet, but at the last minute changes his mind.

Additionally, the company clarified that all Bethesda.net accounts will remain accessible.\n\nSony has shown off the final design for its upcoming PSVR 2 headset and the accompanying Sense controllers, which feature a look similar to the PS5's design aesthetic. Other features of the headset include a focus on comfort, as the hardware has a lens adjustment dial for users to dial in the distance between their eyes and the lenses, a slight weight reduction when compared to the previous PSVR model, and a new vent design to prevent fogging.\n\nAccording to VGC, 2K Games signed a \"new multi-game partnership with Lego\" that will see the company producing a number of licensed titles, the first of which are a soccer game and an open-world racing game. The soccer game, planned for release this year, is reportedly being developed by Sumo Digital, while the racing game is in the works at 2K's own studio Visual Concepts.\n\nFor more information on today\u2019s topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nBethesda - 00:06\nPlayStation VR2 - 01:04\n2K Lego - 01:57\nOutro - 02:58", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snTkzCC42-g", "date_published": "2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "ELDEN RING Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Though shattered, it shall guide thee.
