\n\nevolution simply selects those that excel at multiplying. \n\nIn the case of Covid-19, in which the vast majority of transmission occurs before disease becomes severe, \n\nreduced severity may not be directly selected for at all. \n\nIndeed, previous SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility (e.g., alpha and delta) \n\nappear to have greater intrinsic severity than their immediate ancestors or the previously dominant variant.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsAJzwKwVY", "date_published": "2022-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Brendan", "description": "Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines (Official Australian government publication).\n\nhttps://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/10/covid-19-vaccination-guidance-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-mrna-covid-19-vaccines.pdf\n\nThank yo so much Brendan", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PNPV3EF9oE", "date_published": "2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
