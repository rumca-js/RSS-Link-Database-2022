We cover his life, travels, and his fall to Sauron.  His youth features an unlikely friendship and a rise to power, leading the King's Men faction of N\u00famen\u00f3reans. After Tar-Palantir dies, he would marry his cousin Tar-M\u00edriel, lead his grand army to confront Sauron, and fall to Sauron's influence and lies.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\nTo purchase artist work, check out these amazing artists!\n\nJenny Dolfen - goldseven.wordpress.com/\nTurner Mohan - www.instagram.com/turner_mohan\nTed Nasmith - www.tednasmith.com/shop/\nJerry Vanderstelt - store.vandersteltstudio.com/main.sc\nAnke Eissmann - http://anke.edoras-art.de/anke_illustration.html\nDonato Giancola - https://www.donatoarts.com/online-store/secure-store/Middle-earth-c34110463\nAronja Art - https://www.instagram.com/aronjaart/\nSteamey - https://www.deviantart.com/steamey\nKip Rasmussen - https://www.kiprasmussen.com/\nCK Goksoy - https://www.artstation.com/ckgoksoy\nIvan Cavini - https://www.instagram.com/ivan_cavini/\nSoni Alcorn-Hender - https://www.redbubble.com/people/BohemianWeasel/shop\n\nAr-Pharzon Armor - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe Last Hunt - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon - Steamey\nAr-Pharazon - Celmence Morisseau\nEldalonde - Ralph Damiani\nArmenelos - Ralph Damiani\nAdunakhori - Tom Romain\nAndunie - Ralph Damiani\nWhite Ships - Ted Nasmith\nAldarion Returns From His First Voyage - Ted Nasmith\nBreath of Arda, Manwe - Christina Kraus\nThe Destroying Wave Over Numenor - Kip Rasmussen\nNumenorean Armor Color - Turner Mohan\nAragorn fighting Orcs - Donato Giancola\nAr-Pharazon and Tar-Miriel - Nemanja Bubalo\nAr-Pharazon closeup - Nemanja Bubalo\nQueen Beruthiel - Turner Mohan\nMeneltarma - Ralph Damiani\nTar-Miriel - Turner Mohan\nDenethor - Anna Kulisz\nSauron the Deceiver - Skullb*st*rd\nImperial Numenorean Armour - Turner Mohan\nBoromir Defending Osgiliath - Catherine Karina Chmiel\nMoria Orc - John Howe\nSauron bows, submits to Ar-Pharazon - Kip Rasmussen\nStalker - Skullb*st*rd\nNumenor - Sarka Skorpikova\nWitch-king - Skullb*st*rd\nSauron high priest - Nemanja Bubalo\nValar, Mandos - Anna Kulisz\nValar, Melkor - Anna Kulisz\nMorgoth and the High King of the Noldor - Ted Nasmith\nEru Iluvatar - Janka Lateckova\nThe White Tree - Aegeri\nThe White Tree - Ted Nasmith\nMan in the alley - Felix Englund\nIsildur - Soni Alcorn-Hender\nOdin visits Volsung's Hall - Alan Lee\nArmenelos - Nemanja Bubalo\nWriting - Anke Eissmann\nSauron's Priests - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe Pale King - Skullb*st*rd\nAr-Pharazon old - Nemanja Bubalo\nThe King's Councelor - Turner Mohan\nAr-Pharazon and Sauron - Janka Lateckova\nThe Shores of Valinor - Ted Nasmith\nThe Silmarillion - Skullb*st*rd\nAr-Pharazon's Ships - John Howe\nEagles of Manwe - Ted Nasmith\nRed Skyline - Felix Englund\nDenethor - Anna Kulisz\nAr-Pharazon on Throne - Clemence Morisseau\nTaniquetil - Ted Nasmith\nLight of Valinor - Ted Nasmith\nVarda of the Stars at Her Work of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nEru and Gods Singing the First Song of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nFall of Numenor - Darrell Sweet\nDrowning of Andunie - John Howe\nBreaking ground - Bellabergolts\nQueen Tar-Miriel - Ted Nasmith\nThe Ships of the Faithful - Ted Nasmith\nCrashing Waves - Felix Englund\nSauron - Shadow of War\n\nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
