If there’s one game series that sets a fire in the hearts of gamers, it’s Dark Souls. The franchise has become synonymous with intense difficulty, it’s lack of desire to be inviting to new players, and it’s polarized reception by gamers. So, to prove her skill in time for Elden Ring, producer Jessie Earl dove headfirst into the world of Lordran for the first time ever... and oh boy was she in for an emotional experience.

Horizon Forbidden West is the long-awaited sequel to one of PlayStation's biggest recent franchise starters, Horizon Zero Dawn. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where feral machines roam like beasts and dinosaurs, the seeds of a new civilization have emerged and begun to rebuild. But the nascent tribal societies are threatened by both the machines and each other. The heroine Aloy emerged as humanity's champion in Zero Dawn, and she's back to unlock new mysteries in Forbidden West as she journeys toward the wreckage of the American west coast. Horizon Forbidden West will serve as a showpiece for the PS5, though it's also appearing on PS4 as well. Here's everything we know about Horizon Forbidden West.

Microsoft is bound to acquire Activision and its 43 year legacy, and with it, some dormant franchises Xbox could potentially resurrect. 

It's easy to see Activision for what it is now, with Call of Duty and everything Blizzard. But Activision's impact on this industry is deeply rooted in seminal franchises that helped shape the interactive medium.

CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer recently expressed interest in going through Activision's deep catalog of franchises in hopes to give some of them new life. Activision is the parent company of industry giants like Sierra Entertainment, pioneers in the adventure genre with games like King's Quest and Phantasmagoria. There's also Radical Entertainment, the developers behind Prototype and The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. And before Raven Software was a support studio for Call of Duty, they created the iconic Hexen series and the cult-classic Singularity. All these franchises have been dormant for years, some decades. 

In the above video, Kurt Indovina details Activision's long lineage of classic games that Xbox could potentially rise from the grave.
