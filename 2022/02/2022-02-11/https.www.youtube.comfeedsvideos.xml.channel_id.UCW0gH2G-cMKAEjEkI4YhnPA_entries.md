Ar-Pharazôn leads and already darkening Númenor to its destruction. We cover his life, travels, and his fall to Sauron.  His youth features an unlikely friendship and a rise to power, leading the King's Men faction of Númenóreans. After Tar-Palantir dies, he would marry his cousin Tar-Míriel, lead his grand army to confront Sauron, and fall to Sauron's influence and lies.
