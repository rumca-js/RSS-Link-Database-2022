In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the official confirmation of GTA 6, Call Of Duty’s “New Generation”, and more. 

Rockstar said in a blog post that the next installment in the Grand Theft Auto series is "well underway." Whether or not the new game is called GTA 6 or something else remains to be seen. The studio did not reveal any specifics about the new game, which is rumored to have a Fortnite-style evolving map.

Google has reportedly changed the purpose and branding of Stadia's technology in order to shop the platform's streaming capabilities to other partners. The platform's streaming technology is under a new name: Google Stream.

Later in the video, Persia talks about the official Infinity Ward Twitter account confirmed a "new generation" of Call of Duty would be coming soon, telling fans to "stay frosty." The new game is expected to launch in 2022, following Activision Blizzard's annual release cycle but there are no official dates announced yet.

## Ghostwire: Tokyo Hands Off Preview

A hands-off preview of Ghostwire: Tokyo suggests the game includes some of the things Tango Gameworks is known for, but demonstrates the developer striking off in a new direction.

Developer Tango Gameworks is best known for horror games, and that might skew perceptions of its upcoming title, Ghostwire: Tokyo. After all, both its previous games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2, fall squarely into the survival horror genre, with the first directed by studio founder Shinji Mikami--the creator of Resident Evil. But while Ghostwire: Tokyo was described as "spooky" by former director Ikumi Nakamura on stage during E3 2019 when it was first announced, Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't seem like a game that's likely to scare you. Instead, it seems like an indication that Tango Gameworks is venturing into different areas than what players might expect.

Capcom's Resident Evil 4 gets a free HD mod on PC. This mod updates thousands of in-game textures and adds features like a debug mode and FOV slider. Check out our comparison of the 2014 release VS the fan-funded HD upgrade. You can download this mod made by Albert Marin for free at www.re4hd.com 

The fan-made Resident Evil 4 HD project launches with enhanced lighting, graphical fidelity and improved visuals for both in-game and UI. This comparison video shows off differences in gameplay between the original 2014 PC release and the fan-made HD mod, where over 1,000 textures and models have been updated.    

Time has been kind to Capcom’s Resident Evil 4. Originally released in 2005 as an exclusive for the Nintendo GameCube, the game has seen it’s number of ports and versions on just about every modern platform. Today, while you’re able to revisit RE4 on your phone or in virtual reality, little has been done to upgrade the 17-year-old graphics and textures. Even with the release of the 2014 PC port, the beloved entry is beginning to show its age. Fortunately, a fan-funded HD mod has been created to overhaul textures and provide the sharpest experience to date. The Resident Evil 4 HD mod by Albert Marin is available now on steam.
