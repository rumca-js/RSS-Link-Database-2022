After all, both its previous games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2, fall squarely into the survival horror genre, with the first directed by studio founder Shinji Mikami--the creator of Resident Evil. But while Ghostwire: Tokyo was described as \"spooky\" by former director Ikumi Nakamura on stage during E3 2019 when it was first announced, Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't seem like a game that's likely to scare you. Instead, it seems like an indication that Tango Gameworks is venturing into different areas than what players might expect.\n\nRead GameSpot's Ghostwire: Tokyo developer interview: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghostwire-tokyo-wants-to-mix-up-the-tired-open-world-formula/1100-6500250/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2A3BYOX850", "date_published": "2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Resident Evil 4 HD Project vs Original Graphics Comparison", "description": "Capcom's Resident Evil 4 gets a free HD mod on PC.

Originally released in 2005 as an exclusive for the Nintendo GameCube, the game has seen it\u2019s number of ports and versions on just about every modern platform. Today, while you\u2019re able to revisit RE4 on your phone or in virtual reality, little has been done to upgrade the 17-year-old graphics and textures. Even with the release of the 2014 PC port, the beloved entry is beginning to show its age.
