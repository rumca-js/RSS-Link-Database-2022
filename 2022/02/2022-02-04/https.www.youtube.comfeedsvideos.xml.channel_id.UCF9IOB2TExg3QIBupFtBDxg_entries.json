(2020) predicted that suppression strategy based on a lockdown would reduce COVID-19 mortality by up to 98%. \n\nFerguson, Neil M, Daniel Laydon, Gemma Nedjati-Gilani, Natsuko Imai, Kylie Ainslie, Marc Baguelin, Sangeeta Bhatia, et al. 2020. \u201cImpact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to Reduce COVID- 19 Mortality and Healthcare Demand,\u201d March, 20. \n\nhttps://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2022/01/A-Literature-Review-and-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Lockdowns-on-COVID-19-Mortality.pdf\n\nSystematic review and meta-analysis\n\nTo determine whether there is empirical evidence to support the belief that \u201clockdowns\u201d reduce COVID-19 mortality. \n\nLockdowns\n\nThe imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). \n\nNPIs \n\nGovernment mandates\n\nLimit internal movement, close schools and businesses, ban international travel. \n\nThis study\n\nSystematic search and screening procedure\n\n18,590 studies identified\n\nAfter three levels of screening, \n\n34 studies ultimately qualified. \n\nOf those 34 eligible studies, \n\n24 qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. \n\nThree groups of study\n\nLockdown stringency index studies\n\nShelter-in-place- order (SIPO) studies\n\nSpecific NPI studies\n\nOxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) \n\nThe nine metrics used to calculate the Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls.\n\nA higher score indicates a stricter response (i.e. 100 = strictest response). \n\n186 countries covered\n\nCountries with more than one million citizens are included, 153 countries in tota. \n\nAn analysis of each of these three groups support the conclusion that lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. \n\nStringency index studies\n\nFind that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average. \n\nShelter-in-place- order (SIPO) studies\n\nSIPOs were also ineffective, \n\nonly reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.9% on average. \n\nSpecific NPI studies\n\nalso find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on COVID-19 mortality. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, \n\nthey have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted. \n\nIn consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument. \n\nCritique\n\nWe exclude papers which analyze the effect of early lockdowns in contrast to later lockdowns. \n\nRetrospective study\n\nPick your own end points\n\nVast array of differing countries and circumstances\n\nE.g. compliance in US, Germany, Italy, China\n\nInferences from past to the future\n\nPandemic fatigue\n\nHerby (2021) illustrates, voluntary behavior changes are essential to a society\u2019s response to an pandemic,\naccount for up to 90% of societies\u2019 total response to the pandemic \n\nWritten by economists, principle, damage that lockdowns did to the economy\n\nWere papers chosen to support the theme?\n\nMost of the papers used were by economists, not scientists or medical people\n\nOutcomes were solely deaths, did not include 'cases, hospitalizations or other measures\u2019\n\nThose who were going to die were going to die whether you locked down or not\n\nThe disease itself and the fitness of the patients was largely the determinant\n\nDo not consider the wider factors that could also have affected the economy had there not been lockdowns\n\nE.g. mayhem would have ensued for hospital capacity and routine medical care without lockdowns \n\nRetrospectoscope\n\nThis debate may follow party lines\n\nGrowing anti-science feeling in the US\n\nA future epidemic agent could have totally different characteristics\n\nBella\nOmicron today keeps the Delta away", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcC_2V-5zfU", "date_published": "2022-02-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Omicron reducing intensive care admissions", "description": "Big time, (at least in the UK, not so much in the US)\n\nCases down, but not necessarily infections\n\nConfirmed government case data is missing thousands of LFT results, leading to massive under-reporting. \n\nThis subtle but important change in behaviour, highlights the importance of having multiple methods to track COVID in the population,\n\nWe saw a similar rebound and second peak during the Delta wave as people relaxed more and children went back to school. \n\nhttps://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits\n\nhttps://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports\n\nCDC data\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e3.htm\n\nThree dose protection against omicron\n\nED and urgent care encounters, 82% compared to unvaccinated\n\nCovid associated hospital admission, 90%\n\nTim Spector\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUfjJ1z-a6s\n\nReinfection\n\n7 to 8 % of cases had delta or alpha\n\nAssociation Between 3 Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine and Symptomatic Infection Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta Variants (21 Jan 2022 JAMA)\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485\n\nPrior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n\u2009=\u20092441) of Omicron cases, \n\napproaching  200,000 new cases a day, \n\nhospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths are still coming down,\n\nas Omicron is less severe in a vaccinated population. \n\nIt seems many are, again, preempting the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nIt\u2019s much too early for this.\n\nHigh case rates will likely be with us until late spring before the warmer weather and the summer holidays help reduce infections again. \n\nand shows the power of the citizen scientists that log with ZOE every day. \n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/post/uk-back-to-200-000-a-day\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare\n\nNorthern\n\nI am a retired RN.
