For a long while, the default stack for a server was LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. All open source projects. It's less true nowadays, with tons of new technologies being used to replace these various components, but most of these new technologies are open source.\n\nWith the rise of NPM, the Node Package Manager, it's easier than ever to access hundreds of thousands of libraries for your projects, most of them open source.\n\nRecent issues have showcased all of that. Let's begin with log4j.\n\nIt's one of the most popular logging libraries used online. It gives software developers a way to build a record of activity to be used for anything from troubleshooting to auditing,  data tracking, whatever else. \nCompanies such as Apple, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, Google and Amazon, all run Log4j. Except THIS library had a huge vulnerability that affected almost the entire web a few months ago.\n\nAnother recent issue with a very different outcome was with the very, very popular libraries colors, and faker.\n\n\u201cColors\" enables users to \u201cget color and style in their node.js console.\u201d It is downloaded over 23 million times per week and has nearly 19,000 projects that depend on it. \u201cFaker,\u201d creates fake, realistic data for testing purposes, and it's downloaded over 2.4 million times per week and has over 2,500 projects depending on it.\n\nExcept their developer got fed up of having super successful projects that didn't turn in any money, and were used by fortune 500 companies, so one day, he decided to push an update that borked the output of both libraries. \n\nFirst it would have been easier to spot the issue in log4j had companies that used that library implemented a code review process for open source code they want to use, and maybe contribute to improving said code.\n\nSecond, if companies decided that they wanted to make their own work depend on smaller open source projects, a monetary contribution doesn't seem so crazy.\n\nThe current model of web giants basing their own offerings on the shoulders of unpaid volunteers, and expecting all of that to work flawlessly without ever contributing to it, with code, or money, isn't really sustainable. As a project is used by bigger companies, it becomes a target for malicious hackers, and making sure that this code is secure can become a full time job that no one can expect an unpaid volunteer to do.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtI055VWhYY", "date_published": "2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
