Everyone's talking about the Metaverse, but what is it? It's poised to be the next evolution of the internet, and we'll experience it in fully immersive 3D virtual worlds and mixed and augmented reality. Facebook has zeroed in on this idea so much it changed its name to Meta to reflect it. In this video, I'll look at the potential for this future, the promises it holds, and, of course, the dystopian nightmare it could become if we get it wrong.
