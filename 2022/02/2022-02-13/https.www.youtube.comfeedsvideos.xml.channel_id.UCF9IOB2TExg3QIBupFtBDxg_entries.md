Which seems good and long lasting and cheap, lots of evidence below.

Biological studies

Dan et al (2021) Science, Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abf4063

95% of participants tested retained immune memory at about 6 months after having COVID-19

More than 90% of participants had CD4+ T-cell memory at 1 month,

and 6–8 months after having COVID-19

Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,

with an ancestral variant produce antibodies that cross-neutralise emerging variants of concern with high potency

People who had had COVID-19 previously were around 80·5% protected against reinfection

Laboratory staff routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2, 

people who had had COVID-19 previously were 100% protected against reinfection

Clinical studies

Large, multicentre, prospective cohort study

Previous COVID-19 diagnosis,

84% decreased risk of infection

Letizia et al (2021) Lancet, Respiratory Medicine, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study

https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(21)00158-2.pdf

Prospective cohort of US Marines, 

seropositive young adults were 82% protected against reinfection


Adnan et al (2021) Clinical Infectious Diseases, Reinfection With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Patients Undergoing Serial Laboratory Testing

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/74/2/294/6251701?login=false

N = 9,119, serial tests

Reinfection rates, 0.7%

So

Risk of repeat SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased by 80·5–100% among those who had had COVID-19

Protection from reinfection is strong and persists for more than 10 months of follow-up, (Hansen et al 2021 Lancet)

Memory B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1·3 and 6·2 months after infection, which is consistent with longer-term protection

Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 might not benefit from COVID-19 vaccination
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1


One study found that previous COVID-19 was associated with increased adverse events following vaccination with Pfizer

In Switzerland, proof of recovered infection, in the past 12 months are considered equally protected as fully vaccinated,
