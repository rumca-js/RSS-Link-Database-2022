There\u2019s dense lore, a multitude of important characters, and plenty of earth-shattering revelations. And while the franchise is only really just getting started, we\u2019ve had more than enough happen across a single game and its DLC expansion to warrant a story refresher. So whether you played Horizon Zero Dawn on release in 2017 or you\u2019re just jumping in for Horizon Forbidden West, let\u2019s break down the story so far.\n\nThe Horizon franchise plays out its grand narrative of tribal politics and robot dino-animal-things in the 31st century in the wake of a cataclysmic robot-apocalypse that has wiped out the majority of humanity. Those that have survived have formed tribes, and are living their lives largely devoid of the technological advancements of their predecessors, who are widely known as the \u2018Old Ones\u2019.\u00a0\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn features four of these tribes: The Nora - deeply religious warrior-hunters from the south, who worship at the altar of \u2018All-Mother\u2019 - a mystical mountain; the Carja, who reside in the bustling cities of the central deserts and revere the Sun God; the Oseram - a tribe of practically-minded forgemen and women; and the Banuk, who are a mountain-dwelling tribe of hunters and shaman. The tribes aren\u2019t exactly all on friendly terms either - with the Carja being notorious for raiding their rivals under the leadership of the Mad Sun King, Jiran.\n\nScattered across the stunning post-apocalyptic landscapes are animal and dinosaur-like robots known as \u2018machines\u2019, who for the most part peacefully coexist with the tribes. However, as the years pass by, the machines have become increasingly more violent towards humanity as part of a phenomenon known as the \u2018Derangement\u2019. So begins Horizon: Zero Dawn.\u00a0\n\nHorizon Font: https://www.fontspace.com/horizon-font-f26000", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nopfzl_oIdw", "date_published": "2022-02-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
