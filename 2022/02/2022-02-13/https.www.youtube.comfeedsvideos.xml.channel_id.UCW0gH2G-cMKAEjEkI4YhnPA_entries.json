In this video, I go through it shot-by-shot giving my interpretations, thoughts, and theories.  The teaser certainly left me wanting more - in both good ways, and some ways that are more underwhelming for me as a huge book fan.  We see Galadriel, Gil-galad, Elrond, Durin IV, Disa, Arondir, Halbrand, Finrod, \"Meteor Man\", and new hobbit Elenor \"Nori\" Brandyfoot.  We also got our first look at N\u00famenor, an ice troll, and more.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\nYou can watch the trailer here: https://youtu.be/OCLoZI-FOYA\n\nTo purchase artist work, check out these amazing artists!\n\nJenny Dolfen - goldseven.wordpress.com/\nTed Nasmith - www.tednasmith.com/shop/\nKip Rasmussen - https://www.kiprasmussen.com\n\nHelcaraxe - Jenny Dolfen\nEru and the Gods Singing the First Song of Creation - Kip Rasmussen\nMorgoth Came - Jenny Dolfen\nLorien - Brothers Hildebrandt\nThe Burning of the Ships - Ted Nasmith\nFingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxe - Ted Nasmith\n\n#ringsofpower #lotronprime #lotrrop", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQmGXbXpw80", "date_published": "2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCW0gH2G-cMKAEjEkI4YhnPA", "title": "LOTR Rings of Power Trailer Watch Party!

From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N\u00famenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\n#ringsofpower #lotrrop #lotronprime", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoFnHAUR12s", "date_published": "2022-02-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
