In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about PlayStations plans to launch 10 live service games by 2026, Uncharted possibly coming to Fortnite, and more.

Appearing on the official PlayStation podcast, Hulst said Bungie has succeeded and prospered in the live-service category, which is no easy task. Sony wants to do much more in the space and just announced plans to launch 10 live-service games by 2026.

Twitter user Egyptian_Leaker seemingly discovered an unreleased Fortnite challenge within game files that read "Collect Treasure using an Uncharted Treasure Map." This suggests that the live-action Uncharted movie starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg as Nathan Drake and Victor "Sully" Sullivan could be coming to the battle royale.

Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has reportedly been delayed until next year. No specific reason for the delay was given, and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to officially comment on the game's alleged delay.

In Today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Battlefield 2042 Season 1 being delayed again, the New York Times buying Wordle, and more.

DICE has outlined its plans for the future of Battlefield 2042, and unfortunately, this includes delaying the launch of Season 1 to sometime this summer.

DICE said in a statement "We are heavily invested and committed to the future of Battlefield 2042--working on taking action on multiple fronts to address feedback and implement extensive fixes to the game.”

Messaging platform Discord has confirmed that it is now "gradually rolling out" to US PlayStation console users. Support for additional countries will follow in time, and the process for linking your PlayStation console to the app is similar to linking most devices.

It's been a big month for acquisitions, and here’s another one for the list. The New York Times has bought Wordle, the viral daily word game. Creator Josh Wardle says he is working with the Times to move the game over to the NYT site, where it will "initially" remain free, with your current win streaks and other records intact.
