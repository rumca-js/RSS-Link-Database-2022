But you grasp her meaning: the sense of collision that accompanied her husband wherever he went. Though his talent was prodigious \u2013 he went to art school at 11 \u2013 it often struggled to find its place in a life that was by any standards overpopulated with incident. Born in 1886, Rivera was the son of a journalist who was involved in revolutionary politics, instincts he would famously go on to share. Travelling in Europe, he met Lenin in Paris and Stalin in Moscow; later, he offered refuge to Trotsky during his Mexican exile. But revolutionaries come in many guises. If he talked the talk \u2013 even after fame arrived, he remained proudly un-clubbable \u2013 he was also easily distracted, usually (though not exclusively) by women.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/diego-rivera-by-francisco-de-la-mora-and-jose-luis-pescador-review-rumbustious-hymn-to-a-radical-artist\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/diego-rivera-by-francisco-de-la-mora-and-jose-luis-pescador-review-rumbustious-hymn-to-a-radical-artist", "date_published": "2022-02-01 09:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Marcus Rashford to publish \u2018inspirational guide\u2019 You Can Do It", "description": "<p>England footballer\u2019s follow-up to bestselling debut You Are a Champion is aimed at children aged between 10 and 14 </p><p>Marcus Rashford is writing a follow-up to his bestselling debut You Are a Champion, in which the England footballer will explore \u201chow to celebrate and champion difference\u201d.</p><p>Rashford\u2019s first book, published last May and co-written by Carl Anka, was the bestselling children\u2019s non-fiction title of last year, selling over 220,000 copies in the UK, according to its publisher.
