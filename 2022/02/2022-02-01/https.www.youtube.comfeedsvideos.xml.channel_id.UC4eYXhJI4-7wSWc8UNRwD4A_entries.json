Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnn Powers | February 2, 2022\nTori Amos' Tiny Desk (home) concert debut takes place in what looks like close quarters. The singer-songwriter whose music has served as a beacon for so many listeners during her thirty-year career sits at her beloved Bosendorfer piano with a star-embellished Wurlitzer at her back. On a nearby shelf is a stack of books; one is Suzanne Simard's classic of forest ecology, Finding the Mother Tree. As Amos begins \"Baker Baker,\" a fan favorite from her 1994 album Under the Pink, her bell-like voice fills the room. It's easy to imagine she's in a lighthouse on the cliffs of Cornwall instead of the state-of-the-art home studio where her husband, engineer Mark Hawley, ensures that the mix will be perfect. This three-song performance shows Amos both alone and reaching out, casting sonic beams to guide us in the dark.\n\nThe other two songs Amos offers are from her characteristically fearless, self-interrogating, soul-integrating 2021 album Ocean to Ocean. Her renditions of the title track and \"29 Years\" are magnetic, but what really makes this set a treat is the commentary she shares before each song. Talking about the growing she's done during lockdown \u2013 learning about the climate crisis, confronting her own long-buried trauma \u2013 Amos reveals why she remains so beloved. She still knows how to make the most private and even inchoate feelings accessible. Hers is a lighthouse that welcomes the traveler in for a heart-to-heart exchange.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Baker Baker\"\n\"Ocean to Ocean\"\n\"29 Years\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTori Amos: vocals, keyboard\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Dave Meyers\nAudio: Mark Hawley\nAssistant Engineer: Adam Spry\nRecorded at Martian Engineering, Cornwall UK\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#toriamos #nprmusic #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufUZu4h_m8", "date_published": "2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Announcing the 2022 Tiny Desk Contest", "description": "Have you ever wanted to play a Tiny Desk concert?
