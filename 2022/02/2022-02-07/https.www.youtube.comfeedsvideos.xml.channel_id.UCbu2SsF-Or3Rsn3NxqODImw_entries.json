Exploring the Dreadnaught was the peak of the original Destiny, as it was both a horrifying place to find yourself trapped in, and a delightfully dense landscape full of mysteries to uncover. In the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion The Witch Queen, players are again delving into the throne world of a deadly Hive god. With Savathun's throne world, though, developer Bungie looks to be pushing even harder on creating a twisted locale filled with frightening threats and deadly secrets.\n\nWe recently got a chance to see about an hour of The Witch Queen in action during a hands-off preview, in which Bungie took us through the new destination, demonstrated some elements of the expansion's new story campaign, and showed how new things such as weapon crafting will work.\n\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:56 - Savathun's Throne World\n03:44 - The Campaign\n06:13 - Season of the Risen\n07:52 - Enclave & Weapon Crafting\n11:14 - Void 3.0\n13:02 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUud6SeNrDg", "date_published": "2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Lost Ark Developers React To Launch Issues | GameSpot News", "description": "Lost Ark suffers from issues on Steam, Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Season 2 details are revealed, and Fortnite\u2019s compatibility with Steam Deck becomes doubtful.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about Lost Ark players experiencing an issue with being able to download the game.
