Let's start with the desktop itself, it received a LOT of changes, but they're mostly quality of life improvements.
There's a new Overview effect, that you can access with Super + W . It's basically the GNOME Activity view. KDE also now supports fingerprint login.

It's also now much easier to set a default wallpaper, just right clicking on any image file will allow you to set it as the background.
Panels can be dragged and moved using the main interface when editing Plasma panels.

Right clicking on the desktop now shows a Configure display settings option.
The Plasma Pass password manager has been redesigned, and zones that you can scroll in various widgets now use the same style.
The weather widget will prompt you to be configured at first launch, you can decide to always show the date below the time in the clock, and the main menu's sidebar doesn't use arrows anymore.
In the task manager, you can set new tasks to appear on the left instead of on the right.Programs that play audio will also get a volume slider in their tooltip.

Very important notifications will now sport an orange strip on the side so you can tell that it's super duper important you look at it and maybe do something.
The headers and title text are now more constrasted and more legible, notifications that are related to a video file will now show a little thumbnail of said file, so they're treated like all other multimedia files

Finally, Krunner has a new inline help feature.The focus effect on various widgets, like buttons, text fields, checkboxes, or radio buttons has been enlarged.

Your folder icons will also now follow your accent color if you chose one, or the color used for selections. Speaking of accent colors, you can now define a custom one directly next to the pre-made selections, which is much easier.

Some color schemes haves been modified, with the basic Breeze being renamed Breeze Classic, so there's less confusion with Breeze Light and Breeze Dark, and the latter will replace Breeze High Contrast.

In KDE, even the settings have settings and these have been moved to the system setting's hamburger menu.
Pages that used a single grid or a list now have a more modern, frameless style. The display and monitor settings page now shows the scale factor for each display and their physical resolution, the speaker test feature has been revamped and looks better, and enabling auto login will now prompt you to make changes to your password wallet.

Discover can now automatically reboot your computer once an update is complete, and it also shows a bottom tab bar if the window is very narrow, like on mobile devices. 
T
he updates page has been reworked, and it tells you the source of the update. Discover can also open and install flatpakref files that you downloaded locally.

KDE 5.24 keeps working towards making Wayland a first class citizen. It adds a drawing tablet page in the settings, it supports greater colors than 8 bits, The screenshot tool can now capture the active window on Wayland as well, and support for VR headsets is back, with better performance.

You can also define a primary monitor, minimize all windows using the widget of the same name, and there are multiple improvements to touchscreen devices, notably to make the virtual keyboard appear, or with using styluses.
