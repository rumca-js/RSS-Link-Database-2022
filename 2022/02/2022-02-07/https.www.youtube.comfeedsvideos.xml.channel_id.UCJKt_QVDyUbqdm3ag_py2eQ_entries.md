Couple of questions:

- Title 2, when is this heard in the game? Game opens with the first title.
- The second Thalion intro, how can you get it to play? I always hear the first one and it just loops over and over.

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio. Mostly utilizing SOG_SevenGatesOfJambala.lzx from The Wanted Team (http://wt.exotica.org.uk/examples.html). Playback from DeliTracker.
