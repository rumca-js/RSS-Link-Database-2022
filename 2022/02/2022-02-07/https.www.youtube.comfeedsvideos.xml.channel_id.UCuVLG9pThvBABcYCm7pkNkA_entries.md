ZONING STUFF YOU CAN DO
1) Join our Discord. Since there’s not a great/accessible database of everyone’s local zoning meetings (as far as we could find), we think it would be pretty slick to harness our community’s collective power to make it easier to get this information. We just created a channel called “#zoning” (https://discord.gg/cqRpTpeAH2), where you can drop by and tell us how your local zoning meeting smelled, or share a link that we missed to help others affect change in their community. (And in case you’re like me from a month ago and have no idea how to use Discord, here’s a helpful beginner’s guide - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide- to-Discord)

2) Sign up for Public Comment Workshop from YIMBY Action - Feb 15, 2022 5pm Pacific: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAtc--sqD4oGNCRb8_38HT3Qb92wmXHceVS

Community Board Meeting
City Planning Board Meeting
City Planning Commission
Zoning Committee Meeting
Community Engagement Meeting
Public Consultation (Canada)
YIMBY (Yes, In My Back Yard)
