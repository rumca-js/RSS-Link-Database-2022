Since there\u2019s not a great/accessible database of everyone\u2019s local zoning meetings (as far as we could find), we think it would be pretty slick to harness our community\u2019s collective power to make it easier to get this information. We just created a channel called \u201c#zoning\u201d (https://discord.gg/cqRpTpeAH2), where you can drop by and tell us how your local zoning meeting smelled, or share a link that we missed to help others affect change in their community. (And in case you\u2019re like me from a month ago and have no idea how to use Discord, here\u2019s a helpful beginner\u2019s guide - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide- to-Discord)\n\n2) Sign up for Public Comment Workshop from YIMBY Action - Feb 15, 2022 5pm Pacific: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAtc--sqD4oGNCRb8_38HT3Qb92wmXHceVS\n\n3) City Specific Zoning or Board Meeting Links:\nLos Angeles: https://planning.lacity.org/about/commissions-boards-hearings\nNew York City: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cau/community-boards/community-boards.page\nChicago: https://www.thecha.org/about/board-meetings-agendas-and-resolutions/board-information-and-meetings\n4) Don\u2019t see your city?
