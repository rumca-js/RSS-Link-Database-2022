In Fife, in the south-east of Scotland, there's the Elie Chain Walk: a footpath that's got a reputation for being dangerous. It isn't â€” as long as you're prepared, and as long as you watch out for the tide.

Thanks to Allan Dunlop and Carrie Blair from Outdoor Education Fife, for both guiding me and holding the cameras!
