So far, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands feels like Borderlands 3 channeling tabletop roleplaying culture on a surface level only. After spending time with the Stabbomancer and Graveborn classes, and fostering a goblin rebellion, we were left remembering what made Assault on Dragon Keep so special.

The Minigun is a pop culture cannon of carnage, appearing in hundreds of games and movies. Whether it’s mounted to helicopters in Battlefield, in the arms of Grand Theft Auto V’s bank robbers or churning up the jungle in Predator, developers and filmmakers love to harness the Minigun’s power, but how exactly does it work? (Presented by PUBG MOBILE)

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to discover the surprising origins of the M134 Minigun, and see why it’s one of the least well-represented guns in pop culture history.

The PS Vita is a beloved handheld with a diehard cult following. But how does the failed Sony handheld hold up 10 years later to someone using it for the first time?

For many, Vita means life. It means to be a part of a cult following that believed in the handheld more than its makers did. Sony launched the PS Vita with the intention of bringing the AAA game experience to the handheld market, with big flagship IPs like Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Killzone: Mercenary. But in actuality, the console would see its success from indie games and visual novels like Persona 4 Golden, Hotline Miami, and Virtue's Last Reward. 

Kurt Indovina missed the boat to Vita Island when it was first released in the states back in 2012, but now 10 years later, he's picking up the console up for the first time to see what the fuss is about. Join Kurt in a rather unexpected journey to understanding what it means to be a Vita Islander.
