"Natural immunity in Israel\n\nComparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1\n\nEarly vaccinees were demonstrated to be significantly more at risk than late vaccinees \n\nMaccabi Healthcare Services \n\nN = 2.5 million\n\n26% of the population\n\nProvides a representative sample of the Israeli population \n\nStudy comparing three groups\n\nSARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals with 2 doses of Pfizer (n = 673,676)\n\nPreviously infected, not been vaccinated (n = 62,883)\n\nPreviously infected with one dose of Pfizer (n = 42,099)\n\nWe evaluated four outcomes\n\nJune 1st  to August 14th  2021 (Delta times)\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nSymptomatic disease\n\nCOVID-19-related hospitalization\n\nDeaths\n\nResults\n\nSARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals with 2 doses of Pfizer (no infection, doubly vaccinated)\n\n(Only with vaccine protection)\n\nIf first exposure every (infection or vaccination) was in Jan or Feb 2021\n\n13.06-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection compared to those previously infected\n\nComparing infections in vacationed with previously infected\n\n238 infections in the vaccinated group\n\n19 infections in the previously infected (not vaccinated) group\n\nIncreased risk of symptomatic disease\n\nfever, cough, breathing difficulties, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, myalgia, weakness, headache and sore throat \n\n191 cases in the vaccinated group\n\n8 in the previously infected group\n\nSignificant (P less than 0.001)\n\nIncreased risk of hospital admission\n\n8 admissions in the vaccinated group\n1 in the previously infected group \nDeaths\n\nNo deaths in either group\n\nMarch 2020 to February 2021\n\nEvidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated\n\nBut\n\nSARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees (i.e. vaccinated but no natural infection)\n\n5.96-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection\n\n7.13-fold increased risk for symptomatic disease\n\nPreviously infected vs. vaccinated and previously infected individuals \n\nPreviously infected individuals to those who were both previously infected and received a single dose of the vaccine\n\n20 infections in the infected plus one vaccine dose\n\n37 infections in the infected but no vaccine group\n\nNo deaths in either group\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection,\n\nagainst infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta,\n\ncompared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity\n\nIndividuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant\n\nQuestion 2: Are the data on natural immunity also valid for the Omicron variant?\n\nAnswer: Yes, (Letter to NEJM)\nProtection against the Omicron Variant from Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection\n\nQatar\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2200133\n\nIn addition, we performed\nsensitivity analyses that included adjustment for vaccination status and that excluded vaccinated persons from the analysis.\n\nProtection against reinfections is moderately lower for the Omicron variant\n\nThe effectiveness of previous infection in preventing reinfection was estimated to be \n\n90.2% against the alpha variant \n\n85.7% against the beta variant, \n\n92.0% against the delta variant, and \n\n56.0%magainst the omicron variant\n\nProtection against severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 is similar as for other variants\n\nThe effectiveness with respect to\nsevere, critical, or fatal Covid-19\n\n69.4% against the alpha variant, \n\n88.0% against the beta variant\n\n95% to 100% against the delta variant\n\n87.8% against the omicron variant\n\nThe median interval between previous infection and PCR testing\n\n254 days to 376 days", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0sA3CAPcl8", "date_published": "2022-02-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
