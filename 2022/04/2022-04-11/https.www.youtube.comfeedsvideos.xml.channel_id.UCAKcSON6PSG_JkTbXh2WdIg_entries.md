Lizzo's star simply continues to rise. In addition to her blockbuster music career, Lizzo continues to expand her reach and showcase her talents. Her most recent expression comes in the form of "Watch Out For The Big Grrrls," a new original series on Amazon Prime, and it centers on Lizzo’s search for confident, powerful women to join her world of music videos and concert tours. On Saturday, April 16, Lizzo will appear on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" — as both the host and musical guest.

In 2019, Lizzo stopped by our studio to perform an acoustic set of two songs from her album from that year, "Cuz I Love You." Lizzo is accompanied by Walter Williams on guitar.
