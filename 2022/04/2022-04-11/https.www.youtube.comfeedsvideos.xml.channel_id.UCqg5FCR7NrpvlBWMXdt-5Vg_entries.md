Dying Light's dropkick moves essentially breaks the game's combat, and the gaming community loves it. In the first episode of Snapshot we'll explore how that move came to be in the game.

One of the more frequent criticisms of Marvel Studios productions is that their villains are fairly bland, with exceptions like Kilmonger and Loki; this makes a certain amount of sense; after all, the hero is the big returning character and so it makes sense to invest energy in making them pop; Moon Knight essentially offers a twist on that by essentially literalizing the idea that Moon Knight is his own worst enemy, with so much of the show being about Marc and Steven fighting each other, and Arthur Harrow serving mostly as a foil or mirror.
