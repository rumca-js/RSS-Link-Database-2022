and the strange case of Chine continues

US

Omicron BA.2

Nationally, 3% over last two weeks

Hospital patients down 8.2% past week

Covid-19 Wastewater Monitoring in the U.S.

SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration (copies / mL of sewage)

The level of virus in wastewater is a leading indicator, 

meaning it precedes the change in clinical case counts or hospitalizations.

Monday, reinstate indoor mask mandate

First major U.S. city to do so

Cheryl Bettigole, health commissioner

This is our chance to get ahead of the pandemic

Cases, + 142

(Omicron wave, + 4,000)

knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations, 

and then a wave of deaths, 

then it will be too late for many of our residents

White House, Dr. Ashish K. Jha

We’ve got to watch this very carefully, 

But I don’t think this is a moment where we have to be excessively concerned

Right now that is showing an uptick, 

but not showing substantial changes in what we should be doing

Mayor Eric Adams, New York City

Tested positive on Sunday

Diabetic

I feel fine, no fever, no running nose, no aches and pains

I would probably have had different outcomes if I was not vaccinated and boosted

Shanghai 

China has reported more than 

200,000 locally transmitted cases

Most mild or asymptomatic

One case, currently categorized as “severe”

No deaths reported in the current outbreak

US State department

Americans should avoid traveling to China, 

arbitrary enforcement of local laws and Covid-19 related restrictions

Some family separations

Liang Wannian, senior official, China’s National Health Commission

We cannot let our guard down

people first, lives first

lying flat is not an option for China

Over 60s in China

264 million

40 million of them unvaccinated

Infections among this group inevitable

Guangzhou

30 cases

PCR testing 18 million

## UK peaks, China locks down

US cases still low, but I expect them to rise

Down about 1% as BA.2 has become the dominant

Original Omicron, so contagious, predictable global spread

More immunity

In liberal parts of the U.S., vaccination rates high

Conservative communities, normal life for some time

(death rates have been higher)

BA.2 has recently become dominant variant in India, South Africa, Africa

Andy Slavitt, former Biden Covid adviser

BA.1 has infected 45% of Americans

Fewer tests

Uninsured people now must pay foe tests

Many testing clinics have closed

Jessica Malaty Rivera, Boston Children’s Hospital

Quality of current Covid data “abysmal.”

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former F.D.A. commissioner

Some parts of the country “dramatically” underreporting cases

Trends in Covid hospitalizations lag case trends by about a week

(hospitalizations have continued to fall in the U.S.)



Best guess

U.S. infections will rise soon
