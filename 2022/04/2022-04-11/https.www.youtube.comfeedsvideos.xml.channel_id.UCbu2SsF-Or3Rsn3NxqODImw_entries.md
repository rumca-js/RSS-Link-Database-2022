If you’re finishing up your time in Elden Ring and want another huge, challenging game to tackle afterwards, then this is the video for you. Here are 12… ish games to check out if you want to scratch that Elden Ring itch.

Elden Ring is one of the most acclaimed games of all time, with critics and fans praising everything from its combat system to its open-world design, and it just might be another From Software masterpiece. The game is enormous and seeing everything will take you dozens of hours, but it's hard to put down, so some of you may already have blitzed through it. In which case you may now be wondering if there are other games like Elden Ring out there to scratch the itch.

Well good news, because there are quite a few that may take your fancy. We've compiled a list of games that, for one reason or another, could appeal to Elden Ring fans. Some are Souls or Souls-like games (yes, we mention specifically which From Software games will appeal to Elden Ring fans and why!) while others are similar for a reason like the combat design or the emergent world. It’s not just Breath of the Wild and From Software games though, we’ve provided a big selection of almost twenty games to choose from, coming from developers including CD Projekt Red, Respawn Entertainment and Bethesda. Almost all of the games on the list are massive in their own right, as well, so you should have plenty to play for months.

In our Elden Ring review, we awarded the game a 10/10, and for good reason. Coverage isn’t slowing down any time soon either, so for more on From Software’s masterpiece, check out gamespot.com.

Reddit user KamilCesaro posted a Twitch clip from from Cyberpunk 2077 quest director Paweł Sasko, in which the developer opened up about the team currently working on various aspects of the game.

YouTubers Sekiro Dubi and Lance McDonald, managed to find one of the most exciting discoveries from Elden Ring network test build. This involves a NPC character that was cut from the final release named Monk Jinko. This NPC would have occupied the Scavenger's Shack near the approach to Stormveil Castle and would offer to brew the player an alcoholic beverage once forbidden to mortals, Dreambrew. 

In a 10 minute video, YouTuber ETA Prime walks viewers through the steps of opening the Steam Deck, replacing the SSD with the GPU that's connected via an adapter, held in place with tape and attached to an external power supply.

Square Enix has announced that development is underway on Kingdom Hearts IV. The trailer showcases some brief glimpses of gameplay as Sora squares off against a giant shadow monster in the new location of Quadratum. 

There's no word on what platforms KHIV will be available for, although Kingdom Hearts 3 was eventually released for PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch, with the latter being a cloud-streaming version. Likewise, there's also no release date shared.

As seen in the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer, the AT-ST's foot seems to make a quick cameo at around 0:34 in the trailer, in a location that could be the forest moon of Endor:

In more Kingdom Hearts news, Square Enix also announced a new mobile game called Kingdom Hearts: The Missing-Link, which will have its first closed beta later this year.

Nintendo is finally bringing its motion-controlled sports series to the Switch. Here's what we thought of it based on a hands-on preview.

Nintendo Switch Sports is the long awaited return to the motion controlled sports series that was kicked off 16 years ago with Wii Sports. In that time, the series was seldom seen with the exception of Wii Sports Resorts, and the HD remaster of Wii Sports for the Wii U. Nintendo Switch Sports is a welcome return to classics like Tennis and Bowling, but with the addition of new sports such as Soccer, Volleyball, Badminton, and Chambara. GameSpot's Kurt Indovina (and self-proclaimed Wii Sports enthusiast) got 45 minutes of hands-on time with the game, getting a look at all six sports. Watch the above video to hear about his first-hand experience.
