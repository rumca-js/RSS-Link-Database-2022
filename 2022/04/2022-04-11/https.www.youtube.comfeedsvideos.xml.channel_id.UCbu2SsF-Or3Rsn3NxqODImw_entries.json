Here are 12\u2026 ish games to check out if you want to scratch that Elden Ring itch.\n\nElden Ring is one of the most acclaimed games of all time, with critics and fans praising everything from its combat system to its open-world design, and it just might be another From Software masterpiece. The game is enormous and seeing everything will take you dozens of hours, but it's hard to put down, so some of you may already have blitzed through it. In which case you may now be wondering if there are other games like Elden Ring out there to scratch the itch.\n\nWell good news, because there are quite a few that may take your fancy. We've compiled a list of games that, for one reason or another, could appeal to Elden Ring fans. Some are Souls or Souls-like games (yes, we mention specifically which From Software games will appeal to Elden Ring fans and why!) while others are similar for a reason like the combat design or the emergent world. It\u2019s not just Breath of the Wild and From Software games though, we\u2019ve provided a big selection of almost twenty games to choose from, coming from developers including CD Projekt Red, Respawn Entertainment and Bethesda. Almost all of the games on the list are massive in their own right, as well, so you should have plenty to play for months.\n\nIn our Elden Ring review, we awarded the game a 10/10, and for good reason. Coverage isn\u2019t slowing down any time soon either, so for more on From Software\u2019s masterpiece, check out gamespot.com.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:15 - Souls-Borne & Seirko \n01:54 - Breath of the Wild\n02:49 - The Surge 2\n03:39 - Nioh 2\n04:28 - Remnant From the Ashes\n05:10 - Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\n05:51 - AC Odyssey\n06:34 - Code Vein\n07:09 - Ashen\n07:42 - The Witcher 3\n08:21 - Horizon Forbidden West\n08:51 - Skyrim", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ9l0bbRkcg", "date_published": "2022-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Expansion Reconfirmed, More Fixes On The Way | GameSpot News", "description": "Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s quest director opens up about the game\u2019s future content, Elden Ring fans find a feature that was cut from the final release and Steam Deck is able to run games using an external graphics card.\n#GamingNews #Cyberpunk2077 #EldenRing\n\nLance McDonald: https://youtu.be/2IT-DPhIxX8\nETA Prime: https://youtu.be/8WEGY6aY8lM\n\nReddit user KamilCesaro posted a Twitch clip from from Cyberpunk 2077 quest director Pawe\u0142 Sasko, in which the developer opened up about the team currently working on various aspects of the game.\n\nYouTubers Sekiro Dubi and Lance McDonald, managed to find one of the most exciting discoveries from Elden Ring network test build.

Here's what we thought of it based on a hands-on preview.\n\nNintendo Switch Sports is the long awaited return to the motion controlled sports series that was kicked off 16 years ago with Wii Sports. In that time, the series was seldom seen with the exception of Wii Sports Resorts, and the HD remaster of Wii Sports for the Wii U. Nintendo Switch Sports is a welcome return to classics like Tennis and Bowling, but with the addition of new sports such as Soccer, Volleyball, Badminton, and Chambara. GameSpot's Kurt Indovina (and self-proclaimed Wii Sports enthusiast) got 45 minutes of hands-on time with the game, getting a look at all six sports. Watch the above video to hear about his first-hand experience.\n\n#SwitchSports", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drv_QigzItw", "date_published": "2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
