I haven't been able to do VPN advertising for a long time. Well, this one time, I don't have to: because the robot double's going to do it for me.

With many thanks to all the team at Engineered Arts who worked on this. To be clear, this is not sponsored by them, I paid money (technically, NordVPN's money) for the Mesmer robot -- or at least, for the silicone mask and 3D printed skull that were put together for just one day!
