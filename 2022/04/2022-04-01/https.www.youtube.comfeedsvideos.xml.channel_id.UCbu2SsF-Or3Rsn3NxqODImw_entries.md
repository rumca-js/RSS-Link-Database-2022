It's time to kick back, relax, and throw some god hands at each other.

Our favorite fighting game about high schoolers who jump into TVs is back on the PS4 and PC. A sequel to the beloved Atlus JRPGs, Persona 4 and Persona 3, Arena Ultimax (known in Japan as Persona 4: The Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold) is a wonderful fighting game and certainly not one to be missed.

GameSpot's Persona Boys; Evan Langer, Ben Janca, and Jean-Luc Seipke, are here to hang out and have a good time with you! Challenge us in the ring or just vibe on this chill Friday.
