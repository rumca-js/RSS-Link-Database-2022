Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | April 14, 2022\nI find mehro's voice to be simply stunning; it reminds me of the moment I first heard Jeff Buckley. My favorite new artist of last year opens this Tiny Desk (home) concert with \"chance with you,\" a song of regret from his 2021 SKY ON FIRE project. It's the song that first grabbed my attention and is performed so intimately here from a rehearsal space in Santa Monica. His bandmates include Dylan Bailey on guitar and Callen O'Brien on percussion and a 1921 Steinway.\n\nmehro's strength is in his restraint. The guitars sit quietly under his storytelling and that yearning voice has power without volume. He writes songs to express what he can't otherwise say. \"hideous\" is about someone he loved who wouldn't acknowledge his presence: \"Can't you look at me? / Am I that hideous to you? / Can't you talk to me? / Do I really mean nothing to you?\"\n\nLove and infatuation are themes that turn to poetry for this young songwriter and mehro embraces these well-worn emotions with a grace and beauty that is fresh and fragrant, ending this home concert with \"perfume\" as he looks inward while expressing outward: \"Heels over head in the bedroom / You smell so good, don't need perfume / I'm a tulip, you're the spring bloom / I'd be a fool not to love you.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"chance with you\"\n\"hideous\"\n\"like you're god\"\n\"perfume\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nmehro: vocals, guitar\nDylan Bailey: bass\nCallen O'Brien: drums, percussion, piano\n\nCREDITS\nVideo:\nRyan Calavano\nAlex Forsyth\n\nAudio:\nAdam Comstock\nSteve Hammons\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #mehro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz0wwYOV3PM", "date_published": "2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Brittany Davis: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | April 13, 2022\nIt's a testament to Brittany Davis that this Tiny Desk home show feels like a true live concert \u2014 one with real live energy, as if it's playing out in front of a massive crowd you can't quite see or hear. It's hard to replicate the spirit of the Tiny Desk outside of the NPR offices: You don't get the visual sense of place, you don't get NPR engineers managing the sound mix onsite and you don't get the exchange of energy between musicians and audience members who are often excitedly discovering your music for the first time. Still, this set swims in that much-missed alchemy where everyone in a given room is carried forward by the same sounds.\n\nA blind, Black, nonbinary musician from Seattle, Davis presides over a backing band that features six hard-hitting women. Together, they fuse rock, soul, hip-hop, pop and R&B in four songs \u2014 all drawn from Davis' debut EP, I Choose to Live \u2014 that teem with insights about identity, injustice, authenticity, motivation and power. Each song in this set moves at a different pace, from the righteous hip-hop fury of \"I Choose to Live\" to the plaintive slow burn of \"Loud Loud World.\" But all four convey a clear sense of purpose.\n\nDavis is signed to Loosegroove Records, the hometown label co-founded by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard, and Gossard has already figured prominently in Davis' career: The two share a supergroup called Painted Shield, which also features folksinger Mason Jennings and drummer Matt Chamberlain. If this set is any indication, Davis may well become the biggest name of them all.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Choose to Live\"\n\"Loud Loud World\"\n\"Pink Flowers\"\n\"Madd\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBrittany Davis: vocals, keys\nDivinity Roxx: bass\nQueen Cora Coleman: drums\nKat Dyson: guitar\nMarina Albero: keys, soundscape\nMarissa Garret: backup vocals/soprano\nDarla Rae: backup vocals/alto\n\nCREDITS\nDirector, 1st camera: Bootsy Holler\nDirector of photography, 2nd camera: Niffer Calderwood\nEditor, 3rd camera: Dan Thornton\nDocumentary videographer: Drake Gordon\n\nAUDIO TEAM:\nLead engineer: Josh Evans\n1st assistant engineer: Jon Roberts\n2nd assistant engineer: Chris Mosher \n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:\nProducer: Om Johari\nProduction assistant: Stephanie Allison\nExecutive producer: Regan Hagar\nProducer: Billie Jean Sarullo\nExecutive producer/runner: Stone Gossard\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #BrittanyDavis", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4hevWAjUZI", "date_published": "2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
