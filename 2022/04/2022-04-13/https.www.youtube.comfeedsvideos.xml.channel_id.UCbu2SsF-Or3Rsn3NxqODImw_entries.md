With the 20th Anniversary of Kingdom Hearts, Square Enix has just unveiled the exciting news that Kingdom Hearts IV is in development, and we even saw a Kingdom Hearts IV trailer. Kingdom Heart's 4th installment already has some interesting changes - notably Sora's more realistic look, and what many speculate to be a Star Wars tease at the beginning of the trailer. So, with that tease, here are 7 Worlds we hope to see in the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.

Can you believe it’s been 20 years of Kingdom Hearts? Me neither, and yet here we are, with developer Square Enix using the anniversary to announce that Kingdom Hearts 4 is in the works. The series has taken us all over the Disney-Pixar-Final Fantasy verse over the years, but here are 7 worlds that we’d love to visit that aren’t Agrabah or Olympus Coliseum.
