Here's a list of 5 must play games you should check out.\n\nCall of Duty and Battlefield 2042 were both games that were primed to hit all the usual high notes expected of a solid AAA shooter. Unfortunately both games received a lukewarm reception, with 2042 having a swath of stability issues and glitches at launch while fielding criticisms from its community over the handling of specialists instead of the original class system. Call of Duty: Vanguard on the other hand lacked excitement, with that community fragmented between Warzone, and those who preferred older games like Modern Warfare 2019, or Cold War. In this video we break down and share six shooting games that you definitely need to check out if you\u2019re in the market for something different.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a solid variety here with games like Splitgate pushing the needle into experimental territory fusing two classic games in Halo and Portal. There\u2019s also excellent live-service games like Destiny 2 which recently had its Witch Queen expansion. Reviewer Phil Hornshaw called it the best iteration Destiny 2 has seen yet.

The item reportedly belongs to a set alongside the Deathbed Dress, but unlike the dress, the panties are unobtainable through a quest and seems to have been cut from the game\u2019s final release. One of those players, ironically named Pantsu Dealer, is invading other worlds and leaving the cursed item behind for unsuspecting players. This has resulted in tons of 180-day ban reports from players on the Elden Ring subreddit.\u00a0\n\nThe famous Let Me Solo Her, is now an NPC summon thanks to a mods from Gardebn of Eyes. This Elden celebrity is a pot-head hero who has been soloing Malenia, one of the game\u2019s hardest bosses, and helping other players who are having trouble taking her down themselves. This mod replaces the games Lone Wolf ashes and can take Malenia out pretty quickly.\n\nThere are a lot of changes coming to Battlefield 2042 Tuesday, April 19; over 400 changes in total, including big changes for weapon attachments, voice chat functionality, and improvements for the end-of-round menu.\n\nPatch Notes: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-patch-notes-for-big-4-0-update-have-arrived-see-all-the-changes/1100-6502547/\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:09 - Elden Ring Item\n01:06 - Let Me Solo Her\n01:43 - Battlefield 2042 Update 4.0\n02:57 - COD Warzone", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nzUex9RaMg", "date_published": "2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Star Wars Game From Uncharted Creative Director, For Real This Time | GameSpot News", "description": "A new Star Wars game is announced from Uncharted writer following her canceled EA Star Wars game, Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are reportedly getting reboots, and a Game Boy emulator leaks for Switch.\n#GamingNews #StarWars #Switch\n\nSkydance New Media has announced that it is working with Lucasfilm Games on a new Star Wars action-adventure game that will feature an original story.
