Covid symptom study, another day, another record number of cases

ONS latest

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

7.56% in England (1 in 13 people) 

6.97% in Wales (1 in 14 people) 

6.70% in Northern Ireland (1 in 15 people) 

8.57% in Scotland (1 in 12 people)

Reinfection

The risk of reinfection was around 10 times higher in the period when the Omicron variant was most common (20 December 2021 to 20 March 2022), 

compared with the period when the Delta variant was most common (17 May to 19 December 2021).

Community infection trends

RESULTS
 
In March 2022, prevalence was 6.37% (N=109,181), 

more than twice that in February 2022
Lineages determined by viral genome sequencing

3,382 (99.97%) were Omicron, 

346 (10.2%) BA.1, 3035 (89.7%) BA.2

one (0.03%) BA.3 sub-lineage

one (0.03%) was Delta AY.4

BA.2 Omicron sub-lineage had a growth rate advantage (compared to BA.1 and sub-lineages) of 0.11

Overall R=1.07

greatest increase in those aged 55+ years (R=1.12)

prevalence (in over 55s) on March 31, 2022 was 8.31%, 

nearly 20-fold the median prevalence since May 1, 2020. 

CONCLUSIONS 
unprecedented levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England in March 2022 

almost complete replacement of Omicron BA.1 by BA.2. 

The high and increasing prevalence in older adults may increase hospitalizations and deaths,

despite high levels of vaccination.

This includes seeking views on improving vitamin D intake and status through diet and dietary supplements, particularly among at risk groups.

Current guidelines

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/

October to March, not enough in the UK

Supplement,10 micrograms a day will be enough for most people.

Do not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful. 

Evidence of low vitamin D status

National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS)

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/ndns-results-from-years-9-to-11-2016-to-2017-and-2018-to-2019/ndns-results-from-years-9-to-11-combined-statistical-summary

4.2 Vitamin D

There was evidence of low vitamin D status,

(low plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations in blood)

in all age groups. 

Adults, 19 to 64 = 16%

Over 65 = 13%

Aged, 11 to 18 = 19%

Children, 4 to 10 = 2%

Mean vitamin D intakes from food sources were below the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) of 10µg per day in all age groups
