The Ubisoft Quartz website shows that the company seems to have plans to continue its NFT push. The site thanks the players who claimed their in-game NFTs and goes on to say “stay tuned for more updates with features to the platform and future drops coming with other games!”

According to Kotaku, the next mainline Ghost Recon game could launch as early as the fiscal year 2023, and is codenamed Over. Not much other information about a new Ghost Recon is currently available.

News of the upcoming sniper nerf for Season 3 comes from Ted Timmins, who works on Warzone as Raven Software's Senior Creative Director. Timmins said, "I think we would all agree it’s long overdue. The sniper meta hasn’t changed in what feels like forever."

Ghost Recon Breakpoint will no longer be supported. Ubisoft made the announcement in a Twitter update and said, “The last four months marked the release of our final piece of content.” Over the last several months, Ghost Recon Breakpoint content began winding down with the launch of Operation Motherlode mode and anniversary content that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series.

A new report states that a new third-person hero shooter take on the genre tentatively titled Pathfinder is reportedly in early stages of development at Ubisoft Montreal. Pathfinder is said to be a PvPvE take on battle royale, with players having to battle both AI enemies and other competitors as they work their way towards the center of a map to defeat a boss-like enemy.

During Epic's State of Unreal event, Crystal Dynamics confirmed that it has begun work on the next Tomb Raider game and that it will run on Unreal Engine 5. The studio added: "Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity, and to deliver the high quality cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise."
