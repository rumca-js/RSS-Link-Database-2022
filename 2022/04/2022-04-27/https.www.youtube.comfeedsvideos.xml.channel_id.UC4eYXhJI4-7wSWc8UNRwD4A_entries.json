Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | April 27, 2022\nRoger Eno\u2019s home is part of what once formed an 11th-century abbey called St. Wilmott\u2019s, situated on the border of Norfolk and Suffolk near England\u2019s southeastern coast. The bucolic setting mirrors Eno\u2019s quiet, slowly evolving music which, for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, features five pieces from his new album The Turning Year.\n \nEno refers to his process as \u201cdecomposing,\u201d taking the time to strip away all nonessentials to finally arrive at something more pure and perhaps more powerful. He opts for quality over quantity. Every note, carefully chosen, seems to have its own preeminence. At an old upright piano \u2014 with the sustain pedal firmly engaged \u2014 Eno taps out his slender but potent melodies, gently conducting his string players as they float above and between the notes, providing color and warmth.\n \nWhile there\u2019s an Erik Satie-inspired Zen quality to \u201cA Place We Once Walked,\u201d with its seesawing rhythm, the feather-light notes of \u201cSomething Made Out of Nothing\u201d recall the deep ambient spaces that Eno created with his older brother Brian on their 1983 album Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks. In his writing about The Turning Year, Roger Eno says he thinks of these pieces as \u201ca series of short stories or photographs of individual scenes, each containing their own character.\u201d\n \nTo close the performance, Eno introduces his two daughters Cecily and Lotti who sing an arrangement of \u201cBells.\u201d On the album, it\u2019s a typically wistful Eno piece for solo piano, but the harmonizing voices here give the music a lullaby quality \u2014 and offer up a taste of what it must be like to make music with the Eno family.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cClearly\" \n\u201cThe Turning Year\" \n\u201cA Place We Once Walked\u201d\n\u201cSomething Made Out of Nothing\u201d\n\u201cBells\u201d (feat.
