This song is magical. These people are magical. The SET design is magical (look at that disco ball and the stained glass window! JUST LOOK AT IT.) Seriously. This day was pure magic.

LYRICS
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'll shine up my old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
Oh, I beg you to beg me

I'll shine up my old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I want you to want me
