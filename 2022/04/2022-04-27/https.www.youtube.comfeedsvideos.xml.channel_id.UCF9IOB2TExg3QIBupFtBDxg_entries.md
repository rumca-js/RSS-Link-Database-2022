Denmark is ahead of the strategy, as usual. China latest news, not good at all.

Denmark

Denmark

February 1st 

First country to remove all pandemic related domestic restrictions

(Virus was no longer considered a critical threat)

Tyra Grove Krause, director of infection preparedness, SSI

Let the new wave run through the population

With omicron, it is impossible to stop the spread of infection, even with severe restrictions

First country to suspend Covid-19 vaccination programme

From May 15th 

May resume the programme after the summer

Danish Health Authority

Virus under control

High levels of vaccination

Drop in the number of new infections

Stabilising hospitalisation rates

Bolette Soborg, Chief physician

We plan to reopen the vaccination programme in the autumn. 

This will be preceded by a thorough professional assessment of who and when to vaccinate and with which vaccines

China

Dr Yanzhong Huang, Council on Foreign Relations

They’re not even considering co-existence with the virus as an option right now

Dr Liang Wannian, head of expert panel

huge disaster if China relaxed restrictions

zero-Covid policy insurance for the 1.4 billion people

Background scandals

2018, Changchun Changsheng, violated standards in 250,000 doses of vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough

Hong Kong data

Two doses of Sinovac, 72% effective against severe or fatal Covid-19 for over 60s

Three doses,  98%

One month Chinese outbreak,  31,000 to 250,000 deaths.

Professor Steve Tsang, Chatham House

China’s low death demonstrate clear superiority 

Zero-Covid is Xi's policy

Xi does not make mistakes and cannot be seen to make mistakes

It cannot be changed unless Xi says otherwise

WHO, fully vaccinate 70% in every country by June 2022

African Union also wants 70%

At 70%

Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia Nepal

Most others under 20%

Dr. Seth Berkley, chief executive Gavi, Covax

This pandemic is not over yet — far from it — and it’s imperative that countries use the doses available to them to protect as much of their population as possible

Gavi, secured $4.8 billion

Africa’s vaccination rate

Fewer than 17% have received a primary immunization

Last month, vaccinations down 35% in Arica

Dr. Isaac Adewole, Nigeria, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Would like 70%

There was a time people were very desperate to get vaccinated, but the vaccines were not there. And then they realized that without the vaccination, they didn’t die

White House, global covid summit in May, hopes for renewed funding

Democratic Republic of Congo

Covid death rate very low

Surge in measles threatening 20 million children

Christopher Mambula, Doctors Without Border, East Africa

DRC government cannot spare resources for supplementary measles vaccinations

Serum Institute of India

Stopped producing covid vaccines last December

Before omicron

At least 66% of Africans already infected


Shabir Madhi, professor, University of the Witwatersrand

There’s very little value to it. In fact, we will gain much more by getting to more than 90% above the age of 50

## No BA.2 US bounce

Or at least very small one, this is good news. I had anticipated an increase as BA.2 and its sub-variants spread throughout the United States. However, it seems that the BA.1 wave generated more natural  immunity than it did in the UK. Also the infections in the States are mostly mild or asymptomatic.
