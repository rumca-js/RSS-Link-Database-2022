After TWO YEARS it finally works! Video output through multiple GPUs on the Raspberry Pi. Well... sorta. Check out what we have working in the videoâ€”and what's yet to be discovered.

Special thanks to EVERYONE who's worked so hard on this over the past couple years, especially those in the GitHub issues. See links below if you want to dive deeper into the Pi external GPU rabbit hole!
