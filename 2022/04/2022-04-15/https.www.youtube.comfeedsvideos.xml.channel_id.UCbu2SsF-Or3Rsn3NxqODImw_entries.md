Halo Infinite Season 2: Lone Wolves will be here in just a few weeks, and 343 Industries has revealed the two new maps Spartans will be murdering each other on. Named Catalyst and Breaker. Halo Infinite Season 2 kicks off on May 3 and also comes with two new armor cores and a new battle pass.

Kingdom Hearts IV looks set to introduce a few graphical changes to the long-running series, which includes a more mature look for protagonist Sora and other updated visual tweaks. In a new interview with Famitsu that was translated by VGC, series creator Tetsuya Nomura spoke about these changes and the world of Quadratum, which serves as an afterlife of sorts.

PlayStation Studios recently updated its first-party studios banner to include Sam Bridges, the protagonist of Death Stranding, a PlayStation console exclusive. Kojima posted the banner himself onto his Twitter account without providing any further context, fueling rumors that Sony may have acquired Kojima Productions.

## The Aiming System That Broke Weird West

Weird West is a game built on giving the player as much control as possible, and a lot of that is thanks to its innovative aiming system. An aiming system that also derailed the game's development.

Weird West is a game about giving the player full control over how they tackle any situation so they can craft their own story. That also means giving the player the freedom to shoot absolutely everything. For the game's director Raphaël Colantonio (co-director of Dishonored and director of Prey), freedom and control are the core principles of designing an immersive sim. However, one year into the game's development, developer WolfEye Studios realized that the aiming system they had intended for the game contradicted Raphaël's design philosophy. What was meant to be a few weeks of development, turned into a six-month nightmare. 

This is the story of the aiming system that broke Weird West, and how it eventually led to a shift in 3D twin-stick-shooters.
