Emergence of Recently Identified, Highly Contagious Omicron Subvariants in New York

Wadsworth Center Identifies Two Sub-lineages of BA.2

BA.2.12

23% growth advantage above the original BA.2 variant.

BA.2.12.1

27% growth advantage above the original BA.2 variant.

Potentially Contributing to Increased Transmission Reported in Central New York and Surrounding Regions

BA.2, now 80.6% of infections in New York

During March

BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1 rose to 70% prevalence in Central New York

Data for April

Levels in Central New York are now above 90%

At this time, there is no evidence of increased disease severity by these subvariants

State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett

We are alerting the public to two Omicron subvariants, newly emerged and rapidly spreading in upstate New York, so New Yorkers can act swiftly

get fully vaccinated and boosted, 

test following exposure, symptoms, or travel, 

consider wearing a mask in public indoor spaces, 

consult with your healthcare provider about treatment if you test positive. 

Also

If COVID-positive, stay home and consult with a healthcare provider about treatments.

Improve air ventilation or gather outdoors

New Yorkers who are not vaccinated or up to date with vaccinations are at increased risk of developing severe disease.
