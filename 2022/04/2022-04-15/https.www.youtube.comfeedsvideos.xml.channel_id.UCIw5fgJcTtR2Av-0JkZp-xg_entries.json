The @NovationTV Circuit Tracks is the brain and sequencer. I used the 2 internal synths, for the opening chords and the arp bass. The drums use Drum Tracks 1-3 (kick, snare, hats) and Drum Track 4 is used for the vocal sample. The 2 MIDI Tracks control the @rolandglobal JU06 and @ArturiaOfficial Microfreak for extra chord pads and plinky arps. I use Scenes on the Circuit to go from one section to another, or to 'mute' tracks (it's a workaround - to mute, I use a blank pattern)\nFoe the guitars I use a Zoom G1Xon for effects, going into a @SingularSoundOfficial Aeros Loop Studio, with a @DisasterAreaDesigns Midi Baby on the floor to trigger a loop record and to trigger playbank when the loop recording is done.\nRecorded into a Zoom H5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGKLZ1B_ytc", "date_published": "2022-04-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
