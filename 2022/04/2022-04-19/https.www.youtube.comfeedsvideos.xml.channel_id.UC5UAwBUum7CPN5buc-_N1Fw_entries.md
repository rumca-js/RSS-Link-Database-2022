GIMP

It's an amazing piece of software, that I personally use for all my design needs, for mockups at my freelance job, for youtube thumbnails, or for quick photo edits. 

https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP

Krita

If you're more into digital painting, Krita is what you're looking for. It's super flexible, again, with panels you can move around to suit your workflow, it has tons of brushes, and you can further extend that by downloading new ones.

Inkscape

For vector graphics, the go-to open source app is Inkscape. Whether you want to mockup an application or a website, or design an icon, or just draw something, Inkscape can do it all!

Blender

For 3D modelling, your probably already know about Blender. One might argue it's THE best tool for the job, used by animators, VFX artists and modelers all around the world.

Darktable

Darktable lets you edit your photos non destructively, and your original images are preserved.

VLC

For video playback, you can't find something as versatile as VLC. It's not the prettiest, but it will play virtually anything, even badly damaged files, that it can even repair.

Audacity

Another example of an app that doesn't look good at all, but that lets you do a TON of stuff. It's a powerful audio recording and editing station. It can digitize anything, import and export virtually any format, and even combine audio files.


LibreOffice

LibreOffice: if you've ever used OpenOffice, forget all about it, because LibreOffice is where it's at. It's faster, it looks better, it's more stable, and it's extremely customizable to let you work with either a toolbar and menubar, or with a more modern ribbon.

OnlyOffice

Another solution is OnlyOffice. Its compatibility is better than LibreOffice, and I've been using it for a year or so, now, trading files back and forth with people using MS Office, without any issues whatsoever.

Kdenlive

For video editing, Kdenlive will probably be your go-to. It's a wonderful non linear video editor, with very powerful features to organize your media, edit your project, and render it in a format of your choosing.

Handbrake

For converting video into other formats, handbrake is what you need. It can rip DVDs into a single file, convert any format to any other, using any codec you might want for audio, and for video, and any container format you prefer.
