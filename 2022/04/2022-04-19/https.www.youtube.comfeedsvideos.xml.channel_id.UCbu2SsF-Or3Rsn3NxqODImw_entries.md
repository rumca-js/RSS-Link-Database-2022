Sony Is Also Planning An In-Game Ads Program Similar To Xbox, God Of War Ragnarok Dev Gives An Update, PS5 Users Can Now Update Their DualSense Controller On PC and COD: Warzone Update Addresses Battle Pass Issues.
#GamingNews #Warzone #PS5

God of War: Ragnarok's Cory Barlog has provided an update on the upcoming PlayStation game and said, "We haven't said a lot about this. That's because everybody is heads-down, hard at work. Today, April 20, is the fourth anniversary of 2018's God of War. The game sold more than 19.5 million copies

According to a new report, Sony has begun working on a plan to place ads inside of PlayStation games through a software developer program. Sony's plan is similar to the one that Microsoft has reportedly begun development on, which is also working on methods for inserting ads in Xbox games.The goal of the project is for ads to look like they've been organically inserted into a game, much like a digital billboard in a sports stadium.

Raven Software has released a new update to resolve an issue with battle pass progression in Warzone Season 2. Additionally, Raven Software announced Warzone players will get properly compensated if they log in before Season 2 ends. To further appease the community, the developer also announced that all players who log in during Season 2 will receive two 1-hour Double Battle Pass XP Tokens.

16 years after the series debut and 9 years after the last numbered entry, Saints Row is back and looking to reinvent itself. Even though the announcement of the game's new city and a drastically different cast of characters left fans divided, the experience is still looking to be as wild as previous entries. Just don’t expect super powers this time around. Here is everything we know about Saints Row so far.

Similar to the rest of the series, Saints Row is being developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. With this opportunity to start over, series developer Volition wanted to create criminals that were more relatable and one way of doing that was to show those goons starting from nothing. Each of the new criminals are just trying to make ends meet and head out on their own because they are tired of working for other gangs. Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west.

Saints Row is scheduled to launch on August 23, 2022. The game was originally set to release on February 25 before being delayed so that the team could do a little bit more fine tuning. The game will be released for both current and past generation consoles, as well as PC.

## 5 Shooters To Play That Aren't Call of Duty

Call of Duty, and Battlefield have stumbled out the gates and fans are starting to look elsewhere for FPS and 3rd Person Shooter games. Here's a list of 5 must play games you should check out.

Call of Duty and Battlefield 2042 were both games that were primed to hit all the usual high notes expected of a solid AAA shooter. Unfortunately both games received a lukewarm reception, with 2042 having a swath of stability issues and glitches at launch while fielding criticisms from its community over the handling of specialists instead of the original class system. Call of Duty: Vanguard on the other hand lacked excitement, with that community fragmented between Warzone, and those who preferred older games like Modern Warfare 2019, or Cold War. In this video we break down and share six shooting games that you definitely need to check out if you’re in the market for something different.

We’ve got a solid variety here with games like Splitgate pushing the needle into experimental territory fusing two classic games in Halo and Portal. There’s also excellent live-service games like Destiny 2 which recently had its Witch Queen expansion. Reviewer Phil Hornshaw called it the best iteration Destiny 2 has seen yet. Be sure to like and subscribe and go to the comments, sharing your thoughts on what games you’re currently playing and what you think should make our part two list.

An item in Elden Ring is causing 180 day bans, Let Me Solo Her becomes a summon mod and Battlefield 2042’s 4.0 update gets patch notes and a release date
#GamingNews #EldenRing #Battlefield2042

These forbidden undies are a piece of leg armor called the Deathbed Smalls. The item reportedly belongs to a set alongside the Deathbed Dress, but unlike the dress, the panties are unobtainable through a quest and seems to have been cut from the game’s final release. One of those players, ironically named Pantsu Dealer, is invading other worlds and leaving the cursed item behind for unsuspecting players. This has resulted in tons of 180-day ban reports from players on the Elden Ring subreddit. 

The famous Let Me Solo Her, is now an NPC summon thanks to a mods from Gardebn of Eyes. This Elden celebrity is a pot-head hero who has been soloing Malenia, one of the game’s hardest bosses, and helping other players who are having trouble taking her down themselves. This mod replaces the games Lone Wolf ashes and can take Malenia out pretty quickly.

There are a lot of changes coming to Battlefield 2042 Tuesday, April 19; over 400 changes in total, including big changes for weapon attachments, voice chat functionality, and improvements for the end-of-round menu.
