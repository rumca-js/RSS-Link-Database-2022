Support the stream: https://streamlabs.com/theescapist1 With so many games to complete these days, a lot of people have been asking - how do you push yourself to actually complete them, and manage that massive backlog you've been building. We also discuss the recent Star Wars / Marvel gaming news, plus some updates on how Nick is feeling about the Halo show.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
