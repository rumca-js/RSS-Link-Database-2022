Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | April 20, 2022\nCurren$y's Tiny Desk (home) concert features three key elements that make him who he is: cars, weed and, of course, music. One of the prominent champions of cannabis plays from the confines of a garage on this 4/20, a day deemed a worldwide celebration of marijuana. In front of a purple candy-coated 1965 Chevy Impala sitting on three wheel motion, the New Orleans native plays a smidgen from a catalog that spans over seventy projects to date.\n\nHis name would hold a place in the hip-hop rafters due to sheer volume alone, yet his consistency in the independent space pre-dates just about all of your favorite indie emcees. His formative years as an artist on two of the most successful independent hip-hop labels in the world (No Limit and Cash Money Records) helped develop the homegrown formula for his business. He's helped lay the groundwork for distributing projects online, selling tickets and merch without the middleman or radio play, for over 15 years. This set is mainly composed of fan favorites from his rise in the 2010s. Each song starts with the recorded track before the band takes complete control; however, they let the vocal sample from the opening number, 2018's \"Sixty Two Turbo Jet\" ride throughout. Spitta expressed his desire to play the Tiny Desk a few years back. There's no better time than now.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sixty-Seven Turbo Jet\"\n\"Address\"\n\"Breakfast\"\n\"Airborne Aquarium\"\n\"Mary\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCurren$y: vocals\nPrime: guitar\nJean Laphare: bass\nGroovy Murphy: drums\n\nCREDITS\nDirector and Editor: Adam Vo\nDirector of Photography: Allen Esmail\nMixed and Mastered by FluWop\nProducer: Kayla \"Rose\" Magee\nProduction House: Channel Vivid\nProduction Assistants: Joey Park, Keijuan Jacobs, John Battle, Garrett Brumfield \nExecutive Producer: Mousa\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #curren$y", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izyBoVzC0Wk", "date_published": "2022-04-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Meet The 2022 Tiny Desk Contest Community", "description": "This year, we received Tiny Desk Contest entries from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, from Maine to California and every state in between.
