Street surveillance is so advanced and ubiquitous today that anyone and everyone can be identified and tracked at a distance without consent.\n\nNo one should have a reasonable expectation of privacy when in public. But that doesn\u2019t mean we still don\u2019t have sensitive information that we would not want to be tracked. Health insurance companies would certainly want to pick up on the spike in your recent visits to the pharmacy. A victim of domestic abuse wouldn\u2019t want to be followed by an AI tool rented by their abuser. A protester might want to join the cause but can\u2019t afford the risk of being identified and have the police visit their home. \n\nNothing you do in public can be considered private. But if you can be anonymous, then it\u2019s all you need to prevent linking your public activities to your identity. \n\nBeing anonymous when everyone is watching sounds like a skill reserved only to the top secret agents from a spy movie. But with a number of tweaks, you can render much of street surveillance tech and tactics useless. \n\n[1] https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/17/facial-recognition-a-powerful-ad-tool-or-privacy-nightmare \n[2] https://qz.com/512378/ads-have-started-watching-you-back-which-is-not-creepy-at-all/ \n[3] https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/cameras-targeted-advertising-1.5107784 \n[4] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html \n[5] https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-local-police-facial-recognition\n[6] https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/technology/when-no-one-is-just-a-face-in-the-crowd.html\n[7] https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/30/amazons-facial-recognition-technology-is-supercharging-local-police/ \n[8a] https://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates \n[8b] https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-domestic-violence-stalking/ \n[8c] https://www.eff.org/el/deeplinks/2020/06/how-identify-visible-and-invisible-surveillance-protests \n[9] https://www.wired.com/2015/10/stingray-government-spy-tools-can-record-calls-new-documents-confirm/ \n[10] https://theintercept.com/2020/06/15/protest-tech-safety-burner-phone/ \n[11] https://www.eff.org/pages/face-recognition \n[12] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/how-china-built-facial-recognition-for-people-wearing-masks/ \n[13] https://signal.org/blog/encrypt-your-face/ \n[14] https://nitter.net/evan_greer/status/1266907715437121536\n[15] https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest \n[16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI \n[17] https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gait-recognition \n[18] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JASUsVY5YJ8&amp;t=396s \n[19] https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/06/04/how-do-i-prepare-my-phone-for-a-protest  \n[20] https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/\n[21] https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr \n[22] https://www.wired.com/story/ai-license-plate-readers-cheaper-drive-carefully/ \n[23] https://www.smh.com.au/national/lights-cameras-and-apps-street-protests-in-the-surveillance-age-20190805-p52e10.html \n[24] https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-controversial-protest-surveillance-plane-142721345.html\n[25] https://www.engadget.com/2011-12-27-us-armys-a160-hummingbird-drone-copter-to-don-1-8-gigapixel-cam.html\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_5y1jIWPjc", "date_published": "2022-04-19 16:53:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
