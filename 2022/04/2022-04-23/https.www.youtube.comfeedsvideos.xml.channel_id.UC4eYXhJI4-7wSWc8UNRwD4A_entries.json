He has been celebrated as a writer in many different ways, from columns in most major publications to a mural painted on the side of BAM in Brooklyn. However, his music \u2014 under the Burnt Sugar banner \u2014 has been relatively overlooked.\n\nJoin us in a musical memoriam for Greg Tate, hosted by NPR Music\u2019s Ann Powers, with a panel featuring Burnt Sugar\u2019s Jared Michael Nickerson, Living Colour\u2019s Vernon Reid, saxophonist and composer Matana Roberts, and electronic musician and composer Christina Wheeler. To close out the 20th annual Pop Conference, a gathering of music writers, we will feature music from Burnt Sugar\u2019s extensive discography interspersed with memories of Tate\u2019s work and life.\n\nRSVP for future Listening Party events https://listeningparty.nprpresents.org/ \n\nRead NPR's tribute to the writing of Greg Tate https://www.npr.org/2021/12/11/1063200404/greg-tate-critic-memorial-tribute-guide", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyTjpf47MZk", "date_published": "2022-04-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
