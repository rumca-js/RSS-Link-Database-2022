Greg Tate’s death left an immeasurable hole in the universe of cultural criticism. He has been celebrated as a writer in many different ways, from columns in most major publications to a mural painted on the side of BAM in Brooklyn. However, his music — under the Burnt Sugar banner — has been relatively overlooked.

Join us in a musical memoriam for Greg Tate, hosted by NPR Music’s Ann Powers, with a panel featuring Burnt Sugar’s Jared Michael Nickerson, Living Colour’s Vernon Reid, saxophonist and composer Matana Roberts, and electronic musician and composer Christina Wheeler. To close out the 20th annual Pop Conference, a gathering of music writers, we will feature music from Burnt Sugar’s extensive discography interspersed with memories of Tate’s work and life.
