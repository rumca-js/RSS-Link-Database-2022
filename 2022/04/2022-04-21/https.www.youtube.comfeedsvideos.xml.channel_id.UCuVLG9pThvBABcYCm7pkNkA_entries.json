I don\u2019t like that. And if you don\u2019t stop right away, I\u2019m taking my money and going home.' \n\nOh, and FIRE UP THESE HASHTAGS & HANDLES: \n#DontBankOnIt #StopTheMoneyPipeline #BankingOnClimateChaos #NoMoreDirtyBanks #CustomersForClimateJustice #EarthDay2022 #InvestInOurPlanet #BetterBanking\nTag the banks: @Chase @Citi @WellsFargo @BankOfAmerica @MorganStanley @GoldmanSachs\n\n2) If you don\u2019t want your money financing oil & gas companies, SWITCH YOUR BANK.\nLook into climate friendly regional banks and credit unions with transparent lending policies, or take a look at options like Atmos [https://www.joinatmos.com/] that actively finance climate solutions.
