We also got another good look at what Unreal Engine 5 is capable of and heard from a variety of developers who touted the benefits of utilizing the engine. That even included the reveal that a new Tomb Raider game is on the way that will run on UE5.\n\nVarious games and genres are being built in Unreal 5 right now, ranging from licensed mobile titles to AAA blockbusters. We've gathered up all the confirmed titles that are currently confirmed to utilize it, as well as a look at many of the studios who are lined up to do the same.\n\n#UnrealEngine5", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn50_jZC1Eo", "date_published": "2022-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New PS Plus Release Dates - When You Can Sign Up | GameSpot News", "description": "New PlayStation Plus release dates announced, Borderlands 3 adding full cross-play with PlayStation, and God of War: Ragnarok is still on track.\n#GamingNews #PS5\n\nSony has announced release dates for the new version of PlayStation Plus, and it'll be here soon.

Both the human team, led by Bruce Cambell's iconic Ash Williams, and the demon Deadites are powerful but in very different ways, which creates an interesting challenge for turning the franchise into an asymetrical multiplayer horror game in Evil Dead: The Game. That fact led Evil Dead: The Game developer Saber Interactive to find a different way to balance its game; it still sees a group of four players facing off a horror controlled by a fifth, but both sides are active in different ways and putting up a serious fight.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhwxm-thuyo", "date_published": "2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Gearbox PAX East 2022 Panel Livestream", "description": "Tune in for Gearbox Entertainment's PAX East 2022 Show, featuring a celebration of Borderlands and other exciting announcements from Gearbox Publishing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyqEl01SYA", "date_published": "2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders Worldslayer Reveal Full Presentation", "description": "The \u201cWorldslayer Reveal\" Broadcast is dedicated to unveiling Outriders Worldslayer and spotlighting the new content and systems being introduced.

The trio also discuss the changes Blizzard is making to heroes.
