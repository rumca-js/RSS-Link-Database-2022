Ghost Recon Breakpoint will no longer be supported. Ubisoft made the announcement in a Twitter update and said, “The last four months marked the release of our final piece of content.” Over the last several months, Ghost Recon Breakpoint content began winding down with the launch of Operation Motherlode mode and anniversary content that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series.

A new report states that a new third-person hero shooter take on the genre tentatively titled Pathfinder is reportedly in early stages of development at Ubisoft Montreal. Pathfinder is said to be a PvPvE take on battle royale, with players having to battle both AI enemies and other competitors as they work their way towards the center of a map to defeat a boss-like enemy.

During Epic's State of Unreal event, Crystal Dynamics confirmed that it has begun work on the next Tomb Raider game and that it will run on Unreal Engine 5. The studio added: "Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity, and to deliver the high quality cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise."

343 Industries share new details about Halo Infinite Season 2: Lone Wolves and explain the lengthy delay or Forge. 
#GamingNews #Halo #HaloInfinite

In the new season, which launches May 3, 343 is adding new maps: Catalyst and Breaker. The new season will also feature multiplayer announcer Jeff Steitzer's voice for medals that players earn. The existing multiplayer announcer will remain in place for everything else.

Developer 343 Industries has now explained the delay of Forge a little more. In a blog post the dev said, "It broke our hearts to not be able to launch Forge alongside the rest of Infinite but to ensure it meets the bar we're setting for it to achieve, this massive overhaul to Forge in Infinite just wasn't able to make it out before the end of last year”.

A sequel to Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is coming this year. 31 years after LeChuck's Revenge launched in 1991 comes Return to Monkey Island, and director Ron Gilbert is returning for the long-awaited game.
