Check out Lucas and Lucid VR - https://beacons.page/lucas_vrtech

VR is pretty cool, but some of the most exciting advancements are enterprise-only and cost hundreds of dollars just to get a hold of. But Lucas from LucidVR thinks that’s crazy. For just $60 dollars, you can print and create your own set of haptic VR gloves. These make the Valve Index Controllers feel clunky!
