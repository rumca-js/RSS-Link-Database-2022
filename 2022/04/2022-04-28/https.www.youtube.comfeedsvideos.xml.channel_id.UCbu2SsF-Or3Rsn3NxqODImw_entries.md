Four Top 20 NFL Draft Picks Wore Custom Call Of Duty Clothing At The Event After MW2 Reveal, CoD: Warzone Season 3 Sniper Nerfs Leaves Some Players Unhappy and Xbox Games With Gold Free Games For May 2022 Revealed. 
#GamingNews #CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2

The reveal of Modern Warfare 2’s logo made a pretty big splash on social media yesterday. Later in the day, the game made another, more subtle appearance at the 2022 NFL Draft in the form of clothing. Players like Garret Wilson, Kyle Hamilton, Evan Neal and Ahmad Gardner promoted the game at the event. Gardner was also among the first to see the game. 

The Season 3 update for Call of Duty: Warzone made some pretty significant changes to the battle royale, including a ton of weapon balancing. Unfortunately, some players are frustrated with the sniper nerfs that arrived within those weapon changes, specifically a nerf to completely remove the ability for one-shots to the head

Microsoft has unveiled the Games with Gold lineup for May 2022. As usual, Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Live Gold subscribers will be able to claim four games: Yoku's Island Express, The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk, Viva Pinata: Party Animals, and Hydro Thunder Hurricane.

#GamingNews #Xbox #ModernWarfare2

The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will take place on Sunday, June 12 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Microsoft did not provide any specifics regarding games on display at the event, but Bethesda's Starfield is a safe bet. Microsoft also has new Fable and Forza Motorsport games in the works that could be shown off.

Activision Blizzard shareholders today voted on whether or not to approve the proposed acquisition of the company by Microsoft, and they overwhelmingly approved the deal. The publisher has announced that over 98% of shares voted in favor of the deal

The official logo for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been revealed. Ananimation appears to include some indistinct chatter, along with lines on what looks like a topographical map. Perhaps the audio and other assets contain clues about the game.
