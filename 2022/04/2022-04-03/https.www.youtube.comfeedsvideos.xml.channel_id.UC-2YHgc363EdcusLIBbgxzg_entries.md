The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was a modern marvel when it was first built, but soon became one of the most infamous disasters ever filmed. Before the bridge was even finished, construction workers noted how it tended to sway violently in even moderate winds, and despite efforts to make it stop, on November 7, 1940 it plummeted into Puget Sound, taking one victim with it - a dog named Tubby.

Footage of the swaying bridge, which came to be known as "Galloping Gertie" has become some of the most bizarre footage ever recorded, showing a bridge made of steel and concrete twisting and flexing like it's made of rubber.

But a lot was learned from Galloping Gertie that went on to make future bridges much safer. So in today's video, we look at this event, what led to its demise, and what we learned from it.
