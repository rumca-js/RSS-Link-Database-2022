Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections, UK Health Security Agency

investigate a wide range of possible factors which may be causing children to be admitted to hospital with liver inflammation known as hepatitis

One of the possible causes that we are investigating is that this is linked to adenovirus infection

However, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes

SARS-CoV-2 detected in several cases

Officials stressed 

no link Covid-19 vaccine

none of the children affected by hepatitis had received a jab

Wating for 

Infections, chemicals, toxins

Dr Chand

Normal hygiene measures such as good handwashing, including supervising children, 

and respiratory hygiene, help to reduce the spread of many of the infections that we are investigating.

We are also calling on parents and guardians to be alert to the signs of hepatitis,

including jaundice, and to contact a healthcare professional if they are concerned
