Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.E", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg", "date_published": "2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
