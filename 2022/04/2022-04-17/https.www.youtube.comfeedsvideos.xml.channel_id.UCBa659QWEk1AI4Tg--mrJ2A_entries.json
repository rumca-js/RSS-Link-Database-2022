Because it shakes. But what happens when a bridge like that has to be repaired and refurbished? \u2022 Thanks to Cllr McCarthy: his site is http://corkheritage.ie/ !\n\nEdited by Dave Stevenson http://davestevenson.co.uk\n\nA thorough study of how the Bridge shakes: http://publish.ucc.ie/boolean/pdf/2015/00/32-ODonnell-2015-00-en.pdf [PDF]\n\nI did try (a lot!) to get an interview with someone from RPS Group, who were in charge of the refurbishment, but I just wasn't able to make contact. However, I'm indebted to Michael Minehane, principal engineer, whose talk to Engineers Ireland gives a lot of in-depth information about the bridge was refurbished! You can watch it here, along with Cllr McCarthy's history of the bridge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j52poh2ZfSA\n\nThanks to Youssuf Radwan for the suggestion!\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swLyst02ZK4", "date_published": "2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
