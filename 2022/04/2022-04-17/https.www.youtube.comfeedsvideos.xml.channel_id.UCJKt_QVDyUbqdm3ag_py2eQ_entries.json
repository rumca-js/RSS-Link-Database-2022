There's a note or notes \"left hanging\", which does not happen if you play this in XMPlay (said to be very accurate with IT tracks). But surely an actual Impulse Tracker is accurate enough? Was it because i used 2.14v5 instead of 2.14v3 which is what the track comment mentioned? Who knows... I guess i could've \"borrowed\" the ending from an XMPlay wave write for this video, but i decided to present the tune just how it came out. Well, almost. I did a fade out to shut the hanging notes up :)\n\n- Retro PC circa 2002.
