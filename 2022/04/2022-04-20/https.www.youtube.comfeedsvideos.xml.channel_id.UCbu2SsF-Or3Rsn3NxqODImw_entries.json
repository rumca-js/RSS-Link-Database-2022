Both the human team, led by Bruce Cambell's iconic Ash Williams, and the demon Deadites are powerful but in very different ways, which creates an interesting challenge for turning the franchise into an asymetrical multiplayer horror game in Evil Dead: The Game. That fact led Evil Dead: The Game developer Saber Interactive to find a different way to balance its game; it still sees a group of four players facing off a horror controlled by a fifth, but both sides are active in different ways and putting up a serious fight.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhwxm-thuyo", "date_published": "2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Gearbox PAX East 2022 Panel Livestream", "description": "Tune in for Gearbox Entertainment's PAX East 2022 Show, featuring a celebration of Borderlands and other exciting announcements from Gearbox Publishing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyqEl01SYA", "date_published": "2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders Worldslayer Reveal Full Presentation", "description": "The \u201cWorldslayer Reveal\" Broadcast is dedicated to unveiling Outriders Worldslayer and spotlighting the new content and systems being introduced.

Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west.\n\nSaints Row is scheduled to launch on August 23, 2022.
