Take its most recent update, The Contract, for example, not only did it pull in heavyweights Dr Dre and DJ Pooh, but also brought back GTA 5 protagonist Franklin.\n\nTo celebrate, we brought in Franklin's actor, Shawn 'Solo' Fonteno, to discuss what it was like making GTA 5, and to react to some of the game's most popular clips. In the above video, he describes what it was like to work with both the real and fake Chop the dog, his experience learning Franklin's role in the story, as well as the origins of the infamous Franklin gets roasted clip. \n\nCheck out Shawn's book here: https://sologamechanger.com/book/ \nhttps://twitter.com/Shawn_Fonteno \n\n#GTA5 #GrandTheftAuto5", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcX-RvyW4tk", "date_published": "2022-05-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What A Modern Warfare 2 Logo, Battlefield Redemption Arc, And Overwatch 2 Beta Means For Shooters", "description": "Call of Duty is bringing King Kong And Godzilla to Warzone Season 3, Overwatch 2 has a PvP beta live right now, and Battlefield 2042 seems ready for a redemption arc?
