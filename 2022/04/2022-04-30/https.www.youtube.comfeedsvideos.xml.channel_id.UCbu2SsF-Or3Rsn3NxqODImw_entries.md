Shawn Solo Fonteno, aka Franklin from Grand Theft Auto 5, joins us to break down viral scenes from the game as well as GTA Online's The Contract missions.

It's hard to believe it's been almost a decade since GTA 5 launched, partly because it is still getting updated and brought to current-gen consoles, and partly because its multiplayer counterpart, GTA Online, is still getting meaningful updates. Take its most recent update, The Contract, for example, not only did it pull in heavyweights Dr Dre and DJ Pooh, but also brought back GTA 5 protagonist Franklin.

To celebrate, we brought in Franklin's actor, Shawn 'Solo' Fonteno, to discuss what it was like making GTA 5, and to react to some of the game's most popular clips. In the above video, he describes what it was like to work with both the real and fake Chop the dog, his experience learning Franklin's role in the story, as well as the origins of the infamous Franklin gets roasted clip.
