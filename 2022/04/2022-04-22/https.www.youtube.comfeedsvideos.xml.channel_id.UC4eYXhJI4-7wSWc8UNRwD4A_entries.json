Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | April 22, 2022\nFrom the line up of traditional Colombian instruments to the card playing interlude, every second of Feid's Medell\u00edn, Colombia pool hall performance invokes the feeling of charlando and cantando, chatting and singing, with friends.\n\nSeamlessly anchoring all five tracks with a bass-emulating acoustic guitar and caj\u00f3n-driven dembow, the new guard reggaeton royal brings unique instrumentation and culturally significant visuals to this Tiny Desk (home) concert for a deeply authentic portrait of a star on the rise baring a sonic piece of his soul to the world.\n\nFlexing his multi-instrumentalist background, Feid brings in a new instrument for each arrangement of his hit tracks to represent the five different regions of Colombia in a comprehensive homage to his home. He opens with su propio region, using a tiple guitar from the Andean region on \"JORDAN IV.\" Moving to the Llanos, his band breaks out a harp for a beautiful rendition of \"TE MATA.\" He pulls in a tambor alegre on \"VACAXIONES\" to represent cumbia from the Caribbean region. Pausing for quick brindis, taking a shot, he closes out the show with two heartfelt numbers: First, an accordion-backed, vallenato version of \"AMOR DE MI VIDA\" for the Atlantic coastal region, and then a final pivot to the Pacific coastal region he mixes in a marimba de chonta on \"SI T\u00da SUPIERAS,\" before leaving the hall and riding off on a motorcycle.\n\nThe Colombian artist utilizes his full 15-minute set to depict an artistic and intentional musical image of his home and its rich sonic diversity, bringing the people, place and spirit behind a global genre center stage.\n\nSET LIST\n\"JORDAN IV\"\n\"TE MATA\"\n\"VACAXIONES\"\n\"AMOR DE MI VIDA\"\n\"SI T\u00da SUPIERAS\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFeid: vocals\nPedro Mej\u00eda: Music Director, guitar\nNicol\u00e1s Guevara: caj\u00f3n\nAngel \"Arpangel\" Rodriguez: harp\nDaniel Uribe: tiple\nMateo Morales: tambor alegre \nKike Riascos: marimba\nLuis Javier Hernandez: accordion\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Sebastian S\u00e1nchez \nExecutive Producer: Feid, Sebasti\u00e1n Arango\nProject Manager: Albert Piedrahita\nProduction Coordinator: Fernando R\u00edos\nPersonal Manager: Luis Villamizar\nAssistant Director: Ana Isabel Duque\nDirector of Photography: unmojigato\nAudio Engineer: Miguel Mass\nAssistant Audio: Estefania Giraldo\n1st AC: Camilo Gutierrez\n2st AC: Lukas Restrepo\nRonin: Sebasti\u00e1n Escobar Gil\nVHS Camera: Felipe Molina\nDIT: Santiago Arango\nGaffer: Juli\u00e1n Echavarr\u00eda\nLighting Engineer: Carlos Beltr\u00e1n\nElectric: Nilson Florez\nAssistant Lights: Jhonatan Satizabal, Arnulfo Villada\nProduction Design: Camila Agudelo\nAssistant Art: Elizabeth Rend\u00f3n, John Esteban Isaza\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMhvIlADYc", "date_published": "2022-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
