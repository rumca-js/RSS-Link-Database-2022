The name stood for \u201cDearest Granny,\u201d but I only learned that a week ago :) Her actual name was Jane, but she took on the identity of Danny when her grandchildren came into the world. Some of my earliest memories are of her - sitting by her rocking chair, listening to songs and stories, going to her funeral. She was sharp as a tack, and especially loved poetry and riddles. So the chorus of the song is something of a riddle: \u201cThe window of opportunity is never as wide or so narrow as you expect it to be.\u201d I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s very helpful advice, but at least it makes you scratch your head a little. What I love about the video is that it pays homage to her love of riddles too. The visual stunts are so smart and playful. A special thanks to Dom Fera for directing it, and Athena Wheaton for editing. It took a very focused crew to make this video happen and watching it come together was like magic. All that to say I\u2019m very grateful to you all, and I think my great-grandma would love what we made together.\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1vCgeJQjG0SFPCC9ixbCGz?si=Rhvgntj-RIWCp0kujm6_kQ\nApple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nataly-dawn/332859204\n\n\"Danny\" is an original song by Nataly Dawn from her upcoming album \"Gardenview\"\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nDirector of Photography: Christian Colwell\nProducer: Ryan Blewett\nEditor: Athena Wheaton\nAssistant Director: Michael Kiaunis\nHair and Makeup: Z'Dra Jaye\nProduction Designer: Bethany Struble\nWardrobe: Alexandria Allen\nUnit Production Manager: Quinn Cavin\n1st Assistant Camera: Austin Hughes\nGaffer: Alex Forcillo\nBest Electric: Nolan Englund\nKey Grip: Chris Li\nBest Grip: Harrison Bliss\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nVocals: Nataly Dawn\nVibraphone, Harmonica, Wurlitzer: Ross Garren\nGuitar: John Schroeder\nUpright Bass: Eliana Athayde \nDrums: Kyle Crane\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer/Mix: Caleb Parker\nAssistant Engineer: Henri Cash\nMastering: Will Borza\nProduced by: Ross Garren, John Schroeder & Nataly Dawn\n\nLYRICS\nDanny\nI wish that I could see you there\nRight beside your rocking chair\nRecite your poetry\n\nOh Danny\nYour stories in the Bible\nYour mind was never idle\nWhat are you telling me\n\nSaid you\u2019d be surprised that the window\nOf opportunity\nIs never as wide or so narrow\nAs you expect it to be\n\nOh Danny\nYou always had such good advice\nExcept for when I wanted it\nLike I want it now\n\nAnd you\u2019d be surprised that the window\nOf opportunity\nIs never as wide or so narrow\nAs you expect it to be\nAnd I spent my life looking\nFor opportunity\nWhen all of the while it was sitting\nRight next to me\nYeah all of the while you were sitting\nRight next to me", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eecBkwPHZ8g", "date_published": "2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
