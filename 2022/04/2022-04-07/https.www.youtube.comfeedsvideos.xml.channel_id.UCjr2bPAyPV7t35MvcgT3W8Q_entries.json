This can't go on. If you value my videos, please support my independent work on: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nI have never trusted YouTube. I have always considered it a necessary evil for this channel. YouTube search function is used more often than any other search engine except for Google itself. \nYouTube is unavoidable. And this happened because YouTube used to be better than the alternative \u2013 the cable TV. \n\nToday, YouTube has been corrupted and commercialized to the point it\u2019s becoming worse than TV. All videos are riddled with ads and half of those videos are ads themselves. Either sponsored, or affiliated, creators looking for ways to make easy money online. \n\nYouTube is a multi-tier system. \n\nYou see, if you want to make it big on YouTube, you have to play by the rules written by the algorithm. Because MrBeast\u2019s formula is so successful, every channel now has to emulate it. Whether it fits the content or not. \n\nThe algorithm learned this is the only content that works right now. So every YouTuber under the sun is doing it. There is no integrity. Every YouTube video now has to be a shocking and outrageous clickbait. \nThe dick-sucking facial expressions are totally ubiquitous now.  An anecdotal evidence: Here\u2019s a personal finance channel that adopted the cock-throating technique and gets tons of views because of it.\nHere\u2019s another personal finance channel that didn\u2019t adopt the technique and didn\u2019t get the views because of it.\nThe line between entertainment and education is gone. It has been erased by the YouTube algorithm. Every video has to be a sensation. Anything short of that will fail.\n\nOn average, I dedicate anywhere between 5 \u2013 10 hours of work for every minute of my videos. 5 \u2013 10 hours of extensive research, scripting, recording and editing. Most of my videos barely earn $100 or $200. I let you do that math.\n\nSo small creators cannot rely on YouTube ads for their revenue. That\u2019s nothing new. Just take sponsorship money and sign up for affiliate programs.  But that\u2019s the problem with over-commercialization of Internet content. Just consider what my content is. \n\nA lot of my videos are recommending tools and services for people to use to protect their anonymity, privacy and security. In many cases, their safety and even lives may depend on the integrity of this information. Signing up for commercial services means now I\u2019d have to craft my recommendations around the profit incentive of my sponsors. Which is exactly what\u2019s happening to creators that fall down this route. \n\nNow they will tell you that corporate influence is not tainting their recommendations. But unless they are inhumanely immune to incentives, that\u2019s just not the case. \nWould you trust a journalist that takes money from big oil to talk about a war in the Middle East? Or the energy industry? You wouldn\u2019t. So why is it okay for YouTubers to take money from companies they are supposed to be the most critical of? \n\nIf I want to criticize the big tech, government surveillance and failure of authority; if I want to make recommendations on what people should do to protect themselves from unjust overreach by corporations and states, then viewers should be the ones that hold me accountable. \nYouTube is killing my channel. So what are my choices? \n\nRight now I only have about a 170 patrons. That\u2019s not enough to cover a professional editor for high quality video production. But with 500 patrons, I could hire a part-time editor to not only increase the quality of my videos but also make them more frequently. With 1,000 patrons, I could go out into the field  with a small crew and produce full-length documentary features. This is the ultimate goal of this channel. \n\nThis is the only solution I can make peace with. It\u2019s when you, my audience, step up to produce my content. You can sign up for my Patreon-only podcast with a private RSS feed to listen to up to two episodes a week. \n\nIf you stick with me for three months or longer, you\u2019ll be sent a piece of merch designed by me as form of gratitude for your loyalty. Currently I make stickers, mugs, hoodies and shirts. \nI am even considering experimenting with Briar and Cwtch for group chats and forums for my highest tier Patrons. \n\nSo this is my special plea to all of you. If you want this content to exist, if you want me to keep making more videos, become a producer of The Hated One channel. Become my patron at patreon.com/thehatedone\nThe fate of this channel is in your hands. \n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZZ59HOdAbI", "date_published": "2022-04-07 17:06:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
