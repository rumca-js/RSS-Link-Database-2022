Here is everything you need to know about the latest Lego Star Wars game.

The original Lego Star Wars is the granddaddy of the Lego video game empire, a cute and hilarious take on the prequel trilogy, who's success spawned dozens of licensed Lego games. Now we’re returning to a galaxy far far away with Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker saga, a massive collection that takes you through all nine core Star Wars movies, including the final two films in the sequel trilogy, which haven’t been Lego-fied yet. But even though we are returning to films already covered before, don’t expect a simple retread of the previous games. The Skywalker Sega is built from the ground up and makes changes to the traditional Lego formula to stand out.
