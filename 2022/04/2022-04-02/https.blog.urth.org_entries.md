A number of the companies I’ve been interviewing with are using Guide to create an “interview guide” that they send to candidates. I really like this. It includes information about the interview topic, interviewer profiles, and relevant links to pages on the company website and/or blog. For one company, an interviewer profile linked to that person’s GitHub profile, so I took a look. Instead of the standard profile, they have a custom thing with lots of fun stats about their activity on GitHub.
