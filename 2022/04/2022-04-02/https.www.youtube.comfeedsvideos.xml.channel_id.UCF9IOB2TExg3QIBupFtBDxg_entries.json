virus\n\nChanges to variant classification system \n\nVariant of Concern label\n\na detrimental change in biological properties (changes in transmissibility, severity or immune evasion) compared to the current dominant variant(s); and \n\na growth rate potentially compatible with maintaining transmission and/or displacing the current dominant variant. \n\ndesignate new variants based on genomic features and growth\n\nX = BA.1\nE = BA.2\nX = Delta\nF = Delta\n\nTwo are a combination of Delta and BA.1\n\nXD and XF\n\nXD, few cases detected in France, Belgium, Denmark\n\nXT, small cluster detected in UK, (before 15th Feb)\n\nOne recombination of BA.1 and BA.2\n\nXE is a BA.1/BA.2 recombinant\n\nXE evidence of community transmission within England\ncurrently less than 1% of total sequenced cases\n\nUsing the most recent data up to 16 March 2022\n\nXE has a growth rate 9.8% above that of BA.2\n\nPer week\n\nXE biology\n\n763 XE sequences in the UK data \n\nXE is a BA.1 and BA.2 recombinant\n\n3 mutations that are not present in all BA.1 or BA.2 sequences\n\nBA.2 latest \n\nSGTP is a reasonable proxy for BA.2\n\nEngland on 20 March 2022, 93.7% BA.2\n\nEngland on 6th March
