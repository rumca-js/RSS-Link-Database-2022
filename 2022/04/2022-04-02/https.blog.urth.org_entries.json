I really like this. It includes information about the interview topic, interviewer profiles, and relevant links to pages on the company website and/or blog. For one company, an interviewer profile linked to that person\u2019s GitHub profile, so I took a look. Instead of the standard profile, they have a custom thing with lots of fun stats about their activity on GitHub.", "link": "https://blog.urth.org/2022/03/28/yet-another-github-profile-generator/", "date_published": "2022-04-02 14:39:24+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en"}]
