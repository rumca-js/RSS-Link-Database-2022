Now we\u2019re returning to a galaxy far far away with Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker saga, a massive collection that takes you through all nine core Star Wars movies, including the final two films in the sequel trilogy, which haven\u2019t been Lego-fied yet. But even though we are returning to films already covered before, don\u2019t expect a simple retread of the previous games.
