## FPS Games Are In A Strange Place Right Now

First-person multiplayer shooters are in a strange place right now, it’s time to talk about recent changes to Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Fortnite.

Multiplayer shooters are in a strange place right now. We've seen some fascinating recent successes, as well as failures. There are games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 and Warzone that succeeded and then shot themselves in the foot. There are developers who didn’t listen to the community and saw their games fail hard, like with Battlefield 2042. And there are games that might seem like they've gone on longer than their concepts should allow, but still have new ideas to offer, like Fortnite. 

This video deals with how Call of Duty could finally KO Battlefield with its larger maps and modes. We’ll dig into Vanguard’s new Arms Race mode and how it succeeds in many places that Battlefield's 128-player Conquest mode failed. We’ll also talk about what’s still holding Call of Duty back. After that, we’ll dive into what changes Battlefield 2042 is finally starting to deliver through developer DICE's core feedback initiative, and whether there’s hope for the game's future. Finally, we’ll check in on Fortnite’s permanent no-build mode called Zero Build and how the Battle Royale still manages to stay fresh, largely by borrowing ideas from other games. Fortnite continues to be an evolving game that gives players a lot to do outside of chasing that win.

Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific are out now on all major platforms, with the next Modern Warfare expected to release at the end of this year. Battlefield 2042’s Season One has been delayed till Summer. Fortnite’s Zero Build mode is out now.

00:06:23 - Fortnite 
00:10:43 - Call Of Duty

Halo Infinite microtransactions, progression and more are changing in the near future.
#GamingNews #HaloInfinite

343 has already begun to sell some items from bundles individually and it also attempted to "standardize" pricing with the overall goal of lowering prices across the board. The studio also said it understands players want a "career progression" system separate from the battle pass, and this is in the "design phase" now. Thankfully, the per-match XP feature is coming and is expected to launch sometime this year. And in general, 343 acknowledged that players want the Halo Infinite battle pass to feel as if it's offering a greater value to players.
