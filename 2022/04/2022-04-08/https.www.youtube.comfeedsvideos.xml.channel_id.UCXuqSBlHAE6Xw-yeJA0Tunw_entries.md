Believe it or not, after the switch to M1, there has never been a better time to game on Mac. With powerful CPUs and GPUs these new MacBooks and iMacs can game better than pretty much any computer Apple has produced in the past decade. These new devices would make for excellent gaming machines... if it wasn't for Apple's crappy behavior preventing it from happening.
