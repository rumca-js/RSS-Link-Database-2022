Hello, today I want to do a deep full dive analysis about my personal favorite and (in my opinion) in the best VR game ever made. My list of best VR games look something like: Half Life Alyx, Lone Echo (1, 2, and echo arena), walking dead saints and sinners etc, but the TOP of my list is certainly BONEWORKS by developer Stress Level Zero. 

The system created in boneworks is unlike any game out there. It's something really special. I'm really hoping Stress Level Zero's next game is going to be available for more systems so that more people can see what I'm talking about here. Even though the game has been out for two years now, it holds up better than most.. ESPECIALLY with mods. OH, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece.
