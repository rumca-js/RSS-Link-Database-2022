We've seen some fascinating recent successes, as well as failures. There are games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 and Warzone that succeeded and then shot themselves in the foot. There are developers who didn\u2019t listen to the community and saw their games fail hard, like with Battlefield 2042. And there are games that might seem like they've gone on longer than their concepts should allow, but still have new ideas to offer, like Fortnite.\u00a0\n\nThis video deals with how Call of Duty could finally KO Battlefield with its larger maps and modes. We\u2019ll dig into Vanguard\u2019s new Arms Race mode and how it succeeds in many places that Battlefield's 128-player Conquest mode failed. We\u2019ll also talk about what\u2019s still holding Call of Duty back. After that, we\u2019ll dive into what changes Battlefield 2042 is finally starting to deliver through developer DICE's core feedback initiative, and whether there\u2019s hope for the game's future. Finally, we\u2019ll check in on Fortnite\u2019s permanent no-build mode called Zero Build and how the Battle Royale still manages to stay fresh, largely by borrowing ideas from other games. Fortnite continues to be an evolving game that gives players a lot to do outside of chasing that win.\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific are out now on all major platforms, with the next Modern Warfare expected to release at the end of this year. Battlefield 2042\u2019s Season One has been delayed till Summer. Fortnite\u2019s Zero Build mode is out now.\n\nTimecode:\n00:00:33 - Battlefield\n00:06:23 - Fortnite \n00:10:43 - Call Of Duty", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcKeqxpgy08", "date_published": "2022-04-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite Microtransactions & XP Are Changing - More Cat Ears? | GameSpot News", "description": "Halo Infinite microtransactions, progression and more are changing in the near future.\n#GamingNews #HaloInfinite\n\n343 has already begun to sell some items from bundles individually and it also attempted to \"standardize\" pricing with the overall goal of lowering prices across the board. The studio also said it understands players want a \"career progression\" system separate from the battle pass, and this is in the \"design phase\" now. Thankfully, the per-match XP feature is coming and is expected to launch sometime this year.
