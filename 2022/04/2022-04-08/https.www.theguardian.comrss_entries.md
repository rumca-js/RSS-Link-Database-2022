<p>The Roasting Tin author puts a spicy, tropical spin on Easter roast lamb in her monthly recipe for Ocado</p><p>Traditionally, you’d use this lovely al pastor marinade for pork, but it also works beautifully with lamb, which looks so festive when it comes as a whole slow-cooked leg to carve at the table.</p><p>With new-season lamb now at Ocado, I like to make this one of the first things that goes on the barbecue in spring. The lamb cooks low and slow in the oven before a quick stint on the barbecue for a wonderful smoky flavour, perfect with a fresh pineapple salsa and a pile of tortillas alongside.
