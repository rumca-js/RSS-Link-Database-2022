The lamb cooks low and slow in the oven before a quick stint on the barbecue for a wonderful smoky flavour, perfect with a fresh pineapple salsa and a pile of tortillas alongside. If you don\u2019t have a barbecue at your disposal, flash the lamb under a hot grill after the initial four-hour cooking time until it gains a little colour on top.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/feasting-with-ocado/2022/apr/08/rukmini-iyers-recipe-for-slow-cooked-lamb-leg-al-pastor-with-pineapple-salsa\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/feasting-with-ocado/2022/apr/08/rukmini-iyers-recipe-for-slow-cooked-lamb-leg-al-pastor-with-pineapple-salsa", "date_published": "2022-04-08 10:11:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
