Never trust a crypto influencer...

Ben Phillips is a UK influencer who led the Safemoon crypto team in marketing. Publicly he was bullish, saying that he had "diamond hands" and that people should "buy the dip". However privately he was dumping for millions of dollars, which we found out after a whistleblower tipped us off.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
