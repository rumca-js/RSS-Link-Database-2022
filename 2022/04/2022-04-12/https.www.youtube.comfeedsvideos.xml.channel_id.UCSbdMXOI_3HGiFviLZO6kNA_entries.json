Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! I had more fun making this Tuesday Newsday than I have in a LONG time. The Meta Quest 2 gets the V39 update, something called \"airbridge shows up\" but the Cambria new HEATS up as we dig for information on the next flagship VR headset from Meta. Apple seems to be entering soon as well. ON TOP OF THAT, it looks like Pico may be entering the scene with a western released VR headset. We'll find out for sure this Thursday!\n\nOutro Song:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/etherealdelta\n\nMy links: \nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/2hCGM9BYez\nTwitch:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nInvest in Thrillseeker Media Group Inc. \nhttps://www.startengine.com/thrillseekermediagroup\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Intro\n00:41 F8 has been CANCELLED\n01:26 Cambria leaks\n03:43 TREX looks INSANE actually\n05:10 V39 update\n06:40 Air bridge\n07:55 Meme break\n08:00 Apple\n09:12 Pico event\n10:16 HTC\n11:39 QOTW\n12:22 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzYX0JKVZcE", "date_published": "2022-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
