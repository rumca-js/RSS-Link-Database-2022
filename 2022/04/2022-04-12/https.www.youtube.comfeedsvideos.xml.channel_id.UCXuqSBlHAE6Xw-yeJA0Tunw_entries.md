We’ve built a lot of PCs in the last couple years, but unfortunately, they’ve all had something in common – you usually couldn’t build them yourself due to scalping and stock shortages. Finally, this trend is starting to change with prices coming down and stock increasing, so today we’re building a sweet small form factor rig in a special new case to celebrate.
