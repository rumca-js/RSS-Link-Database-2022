From Software's games have always had a somewhat niche audience, but with the release of Elden Ring, the size of that audience seems to have exploded. The Soulsborne formula works exceedingly well when applied to the template for open-world games, it turns out. In fact, you could argue that it's exploring a strange and enormous world, rather than the usual Souls-style difficulty and mechanics, that makes Elden Ring so fun.

The open-world genre is pretty expansive, and as with major winners before it, like Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games or Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring is sure to leave a mark on the field. The question is, what should the rest of the open-world genre learn from Elden Ring?

## FPS Games Are In A Strange Place Right Now

First-person multiplayer shooters are in a strange place right now, it’s time to talk about recent changes to Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Fortnite.

Multiplayer shooters are in a strange place right now. We've seen some fascinating recent successes, as well as failures. There are games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 and Warzone that succeeded and then shot themselves in the foot. There are developers who didn’t listen to the community and saw their games fail hard, like with Battlefield 2042. And there are games that might seem like they've gone on longer than their concepts should allow, but still have new ideas to offer, like Fortnite. 

This video deals with how Call of Duty could finally KO Battlefield with its larger maps and modes. We’ll dig into Vanguard’s new Arms Race mode and how it succeeds in many places that Battlefield's 128-player Conquest mode failed. We’ll also talk about what’s still holding Call of Duty back. After that, we’ll dive into what changes Battlefield 2042 is finally starting to deliver through developer DICE's core feedback initiative, and whether there’s hope for the game's future. Finally, we’ll check in on Fortnite’s permanent no-build mode called Zero Build and how the Battle Royale still manages to stay fresh, largely by borrowing ideas from other games. Fortnite continues to be an evolving game that gives players a lot to do outside of chasing that win.

Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific are out now on all major platforms, with the next Modern Warfare expected to release at the end of this year. Battlefield 2042’s Season One has been delayed till Summer. Fortnite’s Zero Build mode is out now.

Timecode:
00:00:33 - Battlefield
00:06:23 - Fortnite 
00:10:43 - Call Of Duty
