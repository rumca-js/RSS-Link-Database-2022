In a video posted by Red Orb, the player tested this trick out on child Anakin, using an extended combo of attacks from Jedi character Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nEpic Games and The Lego Group have announced a new \"long-term\" deal to help \"shape the future of the metaverse\" and specifically make it safe and fun for children and families. Epic's most popular game, Fortnite, was not mentioned in the company's press release, so it appears whatever Epic and The Lego Group are building together is separate from the battle royale title.\n\nA remake of Max Payne and Max Payne 2 is in the works. These remakes are coming from Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind the original Max Payne games. The studio has reached an agreement with Rockstar to remake both games for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - LEGO Star Wars\n01:31 - LEGO & Epic\n02:31 - Max Payne", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmkmQYjoktA", "date_published": "2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How Hard Has BOTW Advanced Combat Become?", "description": "Breath of the Wild combat has morphed into a complex monster of melding techniques that requires an insane amount of knowledge and frame perfect timing.
