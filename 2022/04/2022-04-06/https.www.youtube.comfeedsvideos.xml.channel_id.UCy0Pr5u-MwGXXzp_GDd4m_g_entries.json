These groups are adamant that they can remember an incident or specific experience, even when it is demonstrably incorrect. \n\nIn 2010, this phenomenon was dubbed the \"Mandela Effect\" by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, who reported having vivid and detailed memories of news coverage of South African anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s. (Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.) Broome reported that \"perhaps thousands\" of other people had the same memory of Mandela's death, and speculated that the phenomenon could be evidence of parallel realities.\n\nOther examples include memories of the title of the Berenstain Bears children's books being spelled Berenstein or the logo of clothing brand Fruit of the Loom featuring a cornucopia. \n\n#sketch #comedy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwzzOvPz7zQ", "date_published": "2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
