Covid-19 or other Acute Respiratory Infections: a Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trial (CORONAVIT)\n\nDecember 2020 to June 2021 \n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22271707v1\n\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04579640\n\nRandomly assigned 6200 U.K. adults\n\npostal finger-prick 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) test\n\nprovision of a 6-month supply of vitamin D\n\nto those with blood 25(OH)D concentration less than 75 nmol/L\n\n3,200 IU/day, n = 1,356\n\n800 IU/day, n = 1,334\n\nNo offer of testing or supplementation, n = 3,100\n\nOutcomes\n\nProportion of participants experiencing at least one swab test- or doctor-confirmed acute respiratory infection (ARI) of any cause\n\nIncidence of swab test-confirmed Covid-19\n\nRESULTS\n\n2,690 (86.8%) had 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/L\n\nExperienced at least one ARI of any cause\n\nHigher dose group\n76 (5.0%)\n\nLower dose group\n87 (5.7%)\n\nNo

group\n78 (2.6%)\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nImplementation of a test-and-treat approach to correcting sub-optimal vitamin D status in the U.K. population was safe and effective in boosting 25(OH)D concentrations of adults with baseline concentrations less than 75 nmol/L. \n\nHowever, this was not associated with protection against all-cause ARI or Covid-19. \n\nIncidence of hospitalization for ARI was low, and we therefore lacked power to detect an effect of the intervention on severity of Covid-19 and other ARIs. \n\n\n\n\n\nPre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with

Israel\n\nPositive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests\n\nHistorical 25(OH)D levels measured 14 to 730 days prior to the positive PCR test.\n\nDesign\n\nPatients admitted with COVID-19 were

patients admitted, 253 had records of a 25(OH)D level prior to COVID-19 infection\n \nIn patients with the severe or critical disease\n\n87.4% had lower vitamin D levels, less than 20 ng/mL\n\nIn patients with mild or moderate disease\n\n34.3% had lower vitamin D levels, less than 20 ng/mL\n\np less than 0.001\n\nPatients with Vit D less than 20ng/ml versus patients with more than 40
