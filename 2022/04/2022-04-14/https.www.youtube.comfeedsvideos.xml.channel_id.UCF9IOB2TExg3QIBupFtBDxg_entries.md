We are alerting the public to two Omicron subvariants, newly emerged and rapidly spreading in upstate New York, so New Yorkers can act swiftly

get fully vaccinated and boosted, 

test following exposure, symptoms, or travel, 

consider wearing a mask in public indoor spaces, 

consult with your healthcare provider about treatment if you test positive.
