An aiming system that also derailed the game's development.\n\nWeird West is a game about giving the player full control over how they tackle any situation so they can craft their own story. That also means giving the player the freedom to shoot absolutely everything. For the game's director Rapha\u00ebl Colantonio (co-director of Dishonored and director of Prey), freedom and control are the core principles of designing an immersive sim. However, one year into the game's development, developer WolfEye Studios realized that the aiming system they had intended for the game contradicted Rapha\u00ebl's design philosophy. What was meant to be a few weeks of development, turned into a six-month nightmare. \n\nThis is the story of the aiming system that broke Weird West, and how it eventually led to a shift in 3D twin-stick-shooters.\n\n#WeirdWest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf2gyaXd4LA", "date_published": "2022-04-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "20 Minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters Gameplay", "description": "Warhammer 40,000 Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters blends the gameplay of strategy classics like XCOM, with the massive world of Warhammer 40k.\n\nWe get to see how these worlds collide as the Grey Knights take on the forces of Nurgle in this 20 minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe reboot of the 1998 game Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate is set to be released 5 May 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ABW0a8AT4o", "date_published": "2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Chrono Cross Original vs Remaster Graphics Comparison", "description": "How does the recent Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition stack up to the original PlayStation release?
