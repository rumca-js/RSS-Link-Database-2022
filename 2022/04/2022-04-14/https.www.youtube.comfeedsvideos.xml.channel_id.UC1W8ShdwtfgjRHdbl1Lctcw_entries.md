I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of San Francisco 1920s, California Street cable car, Chinatown , Harbor from an elevated view , Golden Gate Park , Steinhart Aquarium , Ferry Building , Ferryboats on Bay, U.S.S. Pennsylvania, long shot, crossing the Bay , Coming into ferry slip at Oakland , Lake Merritt, Oakland, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
