In particular, how our brains accomplish the incredible feat of constructing a three-dimensional reality using nothing but 2-D images from our eyes. A young artist and psychology researcher named Adelbert Ames, Jr. developed a series of illusions that help us understand how this process of constructing reality actually works. Sometimes we need to be fooled in order to gain understanding.\n\nWe'd like to acknowledge Dr. Phil Kellman from UCLA for his helpful discussions about the principles of spatial perception at play in these illusions https://kellmanlab.psych.ucla.edu/ \n\nSpecial thanks to Brian from Real Engineering for 3D printing the anamorphic cube for me! https://www.youtube.com/c/RealEngineering \n\nReferences used in this episode: https://sites.google.com/view/references-ames-illusions/home \n\n-----------\nWe\u2019re on PATREON! \nJoin the community https://www.patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nAli Freiburger\nAmy Sowada\nAttila Pix\nBaerbel Winkler\nBarbora Bei\nBurt Humburg\nClinger-Hamilton Family\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nDeliciousKashmiri\nDustin\nEric Meer\nKaren Haskell\nKen Board\nMehdi Damou\nRobert Young\nRoy Lasris\nSalih Arslan\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ6amzHVkeI", "date_published": "2022-04-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
