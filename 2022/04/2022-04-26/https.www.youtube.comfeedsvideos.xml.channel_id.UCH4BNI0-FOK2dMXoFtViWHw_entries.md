Optical illusions are fun, but they can also teach us a lot about how our brains work. In particular, how our brains accomplish the incredible feat of constructing a three-dimensional reality using nothing but 2-D images from our eyes. A young artist and psychology researcher named Adelbert Ames, Jr. developed a series of illusions that help us understand how this process of constructing reality actually works. Sometimes we need to be fooled in order to gain understanding.

We'd like to acknowledge Dr. Phil Kellman from UCLA for his helpful discussions about the principles of spatial perception at play in these illusions https://kellmanlab.psych.ucla.edu/
