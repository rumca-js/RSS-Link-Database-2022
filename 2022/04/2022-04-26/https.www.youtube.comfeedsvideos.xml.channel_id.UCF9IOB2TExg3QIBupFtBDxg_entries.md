WHO, fully vaccinate 70% in every country by June 2022

African Union also wants 70%

At 70%

Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia Nepal

Most others under 20%

Dr. Seth Berkley, chief executive Gavi, Covax

This pandemic is not over yet — far from it — and it’s imperative that countries use the doses available to them to protect as much of their population as possible

Gavi, secured $4.8 billion

Africa’s vaccination rate

Fewer than 17% have received a primary immunization

Last month, vaccinations down 35% in Arica

Dr. Isaac Adewole, Nigeria, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Would like 70%

There was a time people were very desperate to get vaccinated, but the vaccines were not there. And then they realized that without the vaccination, they didn’t die

White House, global covid summit in May, hopes for renewed funding

Democratic Republic of Congo

Covid death rate very low

Surge in measles threatening 20 million children

Christopher Mambula, Doctors Without Border, East Africa

DRC government cannot spare resources for supplementary measles vaccinations

Serum Institute of India

Stopped producing covid vaccines last December

Before omicron

At least 66% of Africans already infected


Shabir Madhi, professor, University of the Witwatersrand

There’s very little value to it. In fact, we will gain much more by getting to more than 90% above the age of 50

## No BA.2 US bounce

Or at least very small one, this is good news. I had anticipated an increase as BA.2 and its sub-variants spread throughout the United States. However, it seems that the BA.1 wave generated more natural  immunity than it did in the UK. Also the infections in the States are mostly mild or asymptomatic.

Beijing, 70 cases since Friday

Three P.C.R. tests over five days

zero Covid strategy

Effectiveness against symptomatic disease 

After 2 doses of the AstraZeneca

Against the Omicron variant

Starts at 45 to 50%

Drops to almost no effect, 25 weeks after the second dose

With 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna

Effectiveness dropped from around 65 to 70%

Down to around 15% by 25 weeks after the second dose

Two to 4 weeks after a booster dose

Effectiveness ranges from around 60 to 75%

Dropping to almost no effect from 20+ weeks after the booster

 Effectiveness against hospitalisation 

Alpha and Delta variants

Higher levels of protection against hospitalisation with all vaccines

Omicron

18 to 64 year olds

All COVID-19 cases admitted via emergency care

VE after a booster peaked at 82.4%

Dropped to 53.6% by 15+ weeks after the booster

Needed oxygen/ventilated

VE 97.1% down to 75.9%

Also

Omicron generally causes milder disease,
in particular among younger individuals

All individuals who are hospitalised are tested for COVID-19
An increasing proportion of individuals hospitalised with a positive COVID- 19 test are likely to have COVID-19 as an incidental finding rather than the primary reason for admission. 

All 3 vaccines give similar protection against hospitalisation

Effectiveness against mortality 

Alpha and Delta

Over 90% protection against mortality with all 3 vaccines

Vaccine effectiveness against mortality with Omicron

At 25-plus weeks following the second dose, 
vaccine effectiveness was around 60%
