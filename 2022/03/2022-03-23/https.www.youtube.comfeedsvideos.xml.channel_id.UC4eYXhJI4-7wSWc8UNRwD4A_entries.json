The mud. Anything you wanna do, put your mind to it.\u201d The sentiment isn\u2019t groundbreaking, but if you\u2019ve made it to the point in the video at which he says this, it\u2019s impossible not to feel the passion of these words. His set is one of the first times we\u2019ve seen the Houston native play with a band. They set up shop in an H-Town performance space, and the stripped-down aesthetic brings things that could be easily lost in his album recordings. The rawness of his voice cuts straight through the live instrumentation. \n\nMaxo Kream\u2019s Tiny Desk (home) concert exemplifies the importance of storytelling in hip-hop music. His discography deals in-depth with the family struggle. It\u2019s also a reminder for all of us to listen to the whole story. Otherwise, you inevitably miss a crucial piece of the incredibly complex puzzle of his life: poverty, gang culture, his complicated relationship with his parents as an immigrant son. He\u2019s named after his father, Emekwanem Ogugua Biosah Sr., who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria. While the setlist veers heavily toward the trauma Maxo has endured throughout his life with songs like \u201cRoaches,\u201d \u201cMAMA\u2019S PURSE\u201d and \u201cFRFR,\u201d he triumphantly contrasts the performance with insight between songs that indicate that much of what he raps about is now in his rearview.  \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cTHEY SAY\u201d\n\u201cRoaches\u201d\n\u201cFRFR\u201d\n\u201cMAMA'S PURSE\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nMaxo Kream: vocals\nOscar Santander: arrangements, piano, guitar\nNicco Martinez: guitar, piano\nTony Bautista: bass\nIan McGilber: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Screenville Films\nAudio: Alfredo De la Garza, Gabriel Medina\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #maxokream", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5de8UjLRZBI", "date_published": "2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Pom Pom Squad", "description": "Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

The opening chords of \"Drunk Voicemail\" \u2013 brash and heavy \u2013 tease the band's lead-in, letting imagination conjure up images of dirty basements and scruffy dishevelment before revealing the truth: five people in cheesy, matching red outfits, led by Mia Berrin in puffy plaid. It's a presentation that reflects the ethos of Pom Pom Squad: to give the often self-serious genres of grunge and punk a much-needed dose of silly camp.\n\nDeath of a Cheerleader was one of the most exciting albums of 2021, a modern take on the Sleater-Kinney ethos supercharged with a Ronnie Spector-esque retro sensibility. In its work, the group aims to deconstruct the idea of the \"cheerleader,\" allowing that central trope to make way for subversive choices both in image and in songwriting. Berrin writes romantically, but in a bitter, dissecting way, and her performance sometimes finds her at odds with the instrumentals; as the band tackles the standout track \"Crying,\" Berrin's voice beautifully cracks and strains, adding a dose of reality to the dream-like instrumental behind her \u2013 including touring band members Lauren Marquez on bass and Camellia Hartman on violin.\n\nAfter \"Drunk Voicemail,\" Berrin makes it a point to say that she and her band \"grew up on\" watching Tiny Desks over the years, learning about what makes a great live performance from watching. Life imitates art, it seems, because the whole band is performing with a sense of seasoned comfort as it breezes through these five songs, inspiring even the most dour viewer to raise their own pom-poms and cheer it on.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Drunk Voicemail\"\n\"Head Cheerleader\"\n\"Cherry Blossom\"\n\"Crying\"\n\"Be Good\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMia Berrin: vocals, guitar\nAlex Mercuri: guitar\nShelby Keller: drums\nLauren Marquez: bass\nCamellia Hartman: violin\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Aysia Marotta & Mia Berrin\nDP/Editor: Aysia Marotta\nCamera Operator: Sara Falco\nSet design: Sinjun Strom\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #pompomsquad", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJe0JcKLWaE", "date_published": "2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
