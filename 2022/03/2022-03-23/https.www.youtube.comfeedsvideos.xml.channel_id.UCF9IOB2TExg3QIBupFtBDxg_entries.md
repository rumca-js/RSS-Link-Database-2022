Vaccines are still hugely effective at preventing severe illness, 

but less effective at stopping people catching and spreading the virus

At the same time, we now have increasing levels of infection-acquired immunity in the population. 

This means that allowing unvaccinated people into places like cafes and bars doesn’t substantially alter the risk of catching Covid there

and pressure on our healthcare system is likely to remain high. 

Keeping mask rules is crucial to limit transmission
