It feels so strange to be announcing this! Like releasing a video makes it official or something…but I’ve made a solo album!!! It’s called Gardenview and it’s coming out in JUNE! There are two tracks you can listen to right now (wherever you listen to music): “Follow the Light” and “Over the Moon.”

LYRICS
Follow the light
I know it’s in there somewhere
Trying to hide
Say does my optimism
Drive you up
The wall

Well that’s too bad
Cause I’ll be fighting for you
Till my dying breath
Whatever comes out then
I hope it makes you smile

Cause I
Can’t
Live
Without
You now

Strap on your boots
Cause I won’t be the first to cut you loose
I know it’s your temperament
To push good things away

So I won’t be too good
No, I'll leave you angry when I know I should
Just say the word
And we can put our knives away

Cause I
Can’t
Live
Without
You now

So please don’t make me
