Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and The Division Mobile Games are coming, the next Battlefield is reportedly in pre-production, and Warzone’s original map may never come back. 
#GamingNews #Warzone

According to a report from The Exputer, Rainbow Six Siege mobile game will be revealed on April 6. The project is developed by Ubisoft in collaboration with Tencent's WeGame and Mobile games based on Assassin's Creed and The Division are also reportedly in the works. 

Pre-production has reportedly begun on the next Battlefield game, and will see the series revert to its familiar roots after changes introduced in Battlefield 2042 weren't well-received. As for Battlefield 2042's future, EA and DICE are still required to release new specialists, modes, weapons, vehicles, and maps as part of its battle pass obligations

According to Raven Software developer Josh Bridge,  Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, Verdansk, will not come back due to a technical issue preventing this from being possible. Instead, Activision is putting more effort into technical optimizations for Warzone to allow for big updates without such massive downloads.

## Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Dual Wielding Magic Gameplay

We catch up with Brick, now the Punchfather, from Borderlands 2 and test our dual-magic-wielding glass cannon Spellshot and Clawbringer build. Many mushroom enemies were harmed in the making of this video.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands recasts the Borderlands series with a fantasy theme. The game builds off of ideas from Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot adventure, which originally released as DLC for Borderlands 2. In Wonderlands, players are still inside a tabletop campaign called Bunkers and Badasses with Tina as the Bunkermaster. In this part of the campaign, The Tangledrift area, a familiar Borderlands 2 character Brick, shows up to take on the role of the Punchfather, basically a fairy that punches things. The rest of the section is very Jack, and the Beanstalk inspired combined with Borderlands loud and brash humor.

In this gameplay clip, we’re showing off the character class Spellshot. This class is a gun wizard who focuses on damage output and dual-wielding magic. Since this section takes part in a later portion of the game, you’ll get to see the multiclass system in action. We’ve combined the Spellshot with the Clawbringer skill trees, which adds a Wyvern Companion. This multiclass combination creates a glass cannon build where the Spellshot does extra damage but only regenerates shields when casting magic or making kills. In order to kill more quickly, you’ll see us dual-wield wands and rapid-fire lightning blasts with our Wyvern Companion flying around, setting enemies on fire.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands releases on March 25th, with the Season One pass starting April 21st. The game will launch for PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you should be aware that only the two more expensive editions of the game have new-gen optimizations.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but this Borderlands spin-off struggles to find its own identity.
