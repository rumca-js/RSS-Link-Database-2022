Many mushroom enemies were harmed in the making of this video.\n\nTiny Tina's Wonderlands recasts the Borderlands series with a fantasy theme. The game builds off of ideas from Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot adventure, which originally released as DLC for Borderlands 2. In Wonderlands, players are still inside a tabletop campaign called Bunkers and Badasses with Tina as the Bunkermaster. In this part of the campaign, The Tangledrift area, a familiar Borderlands 2 character Brick, shows up to take on the role of the Punchfather, basically a fairy that punches things. The rest of the section is very Jack, and the Beanstalk inspired combined with Borderlands loud and brash humor.\n\nIn this gameplay clip, we\u2019re showing off the character class Spellshot. This class is a gun wizard who focuses on damage output and dual-wielding magic. Since this section takes part in a later portion of the game, you\u2019ll get to see the multiclass system in action. We\u2019ve combined the Spellshot with the Clawbringer skill trees, which adds a Wyvern Companion. This multiclass combination creates a glass cannon build where the Spellshot does extra damage but only regenerates shields when casting magic or making kills. In order to kill more quickly, you\u2019ll see us dual-wield wands and rapid-fire lightning blasts with our Wyvern Companion flying around, setting enemies on fire.\n\nTiny Tina's Wonderlands releases on March 25th, with the Season One pass starting April 21st. The game will launch for PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you should be aware that only the two more expensive editions of the game have new-gen optimizations.\n\n#TinyTinasWonderland", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRoY6VFfPNE", "date_published": "2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Review", "description": "Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but this Borderlands spin-off struggles to find its own identity.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsiXTrgeBf8", "date_published": "2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
