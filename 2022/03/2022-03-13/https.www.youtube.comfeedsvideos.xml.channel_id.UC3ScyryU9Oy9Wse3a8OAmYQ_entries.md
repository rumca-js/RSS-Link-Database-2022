In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Putin’s Road to War,” Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute shares her take on Vladimir Putin’s decision-making in the lead-up to the war on Ukraine.

"This was a miscalculation of Napoleonic magnitude," she tells FRONTLINE. "And one of the things we should be worried about now is Vladimir Putin being a rat trapped in a corner and willing to do lots of damage to everything else on his way to failure."

Schake is the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. She previously served at the U.S. State Department, the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. She is the author of several books, most recently "America vs the West: Can the Liberal World Order Be Preserved?"

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE's Mike Wiser on March 4, 2022. It has been edited for clarity and length.
