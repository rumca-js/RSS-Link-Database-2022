An open world Shibuya to run around in? Check. Cat Yokai who've taken over all the local convenience stores. You know it! And for you dog lovers, not only are there plenty of Shiba to pet, but if you give them food they'll dig up a reward for you.\n\nWe also show off the game's spirit finger gun combat, which has you blasting your jutsu at the many evil spirts that have invaded the city. It may be a little simple, but thanks to the slick animations, it's also very satisfying.\n\nGhostwire: Toyko hits PlayStation 5 and PC on March 25, 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HqSmvUfkbg", "date_published": "2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghostwire: Tokyo - High Hopes After The First 5 Hours", "description": "We've gotten to play the first two chapters of Ghostwire: Tokyo, and are excited at the promise the game shows.\n\nJean-Luc's time with the game clarified a lot of what exactly Ghostwire: Tokyo is. In many ways the game is building off of the open world foundation found in developer Tango Gameworks previous game, The Evil Within 2. There's plenty to do in the empty streets of Shibyua with side quests take on, shops to buy from, and collectable to find. The combat, while simple, is increiabley satisfying \n\nBased on his experience, Jean-Luc greatly enjoyed Ghostwire: Tokyo and has high hopes for it as long as it can maintain this level of quality for the rest of the game. Our preview build of the game is running on the PlayStation 5 and the footage you are seeing is in performance mode.\n\n#GhostwireTokyo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkUt394HEbk", "date_published": "2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Will PlayStation Unban Borderlands 3 Cross-Play? | GameSpot News", "description": "Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands will have cross-play at launch, Hogwarts Legacy State of Play is announced for March 17 and Halo Infinite crash bug is fixed on PC in new update\n\nGearbox's Randy Pitchford confirmed the upcoming Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands will have cross-play support for all platforms at launch.
