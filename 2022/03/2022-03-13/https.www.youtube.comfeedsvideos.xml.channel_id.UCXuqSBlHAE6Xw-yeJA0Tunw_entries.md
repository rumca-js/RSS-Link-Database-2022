We're expanding the team behind LTTStore.com so much that we had to get them their own office space, but rather than paying for ANOTHER internet connection we figured, why not share the 10 Gigabit connection we have at the main office... except rather than through a wire... we're doing it wirelessly with the help of Ubiquiti's new AirFibre XG wireless point to point bridge system.

Just how bad is Wish.com for getting water cooling components? Worse than we expected... and we expected it to be terrible.
