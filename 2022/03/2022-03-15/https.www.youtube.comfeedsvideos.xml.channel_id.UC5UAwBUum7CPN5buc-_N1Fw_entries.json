It's a GOOD thing.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoy about using Fedora, is that they push the Linux desktop towards the future. Some call it bleeding edge, but it's not. It's cutting edge: you don't get the absolute latest, but you get the best that's also stable.\n\nFedora was among the first to adopt Wayland, the first to adopt Pipewire, to push Flatpak, portals, the first mainstream distro to push immutable filesystems in Fedora Silverblue.\n\nThis drive towards modern tech was what Ubuntu was doing back in the day: they were implementing the latest versions of GNOME, adopted newly developed programs at the time, like Banshee, or F-Spot, they pushed to have better driver integration, and more software available.\n\nUsing Fedora, I got that same excitement I used to get when I was using Ubuntu: every 6 months, there's a new drop of amazing updates. You get more modern technologies, you get improved security, you get new features right as they're being released, and you get that sense of really taking advantage of all that new stuff the Linux community talks about.\n\nFedora is a \"current\" distro, which means that you get the latest release of all the interesting stuff, like the desktop environments, the linux kernel, the graphics drivers, or wayland. And they do this without sacrificing stability.\n\nFedora, in my experience with it, has been rock solid. In general, I didn't have many problems with any Linux distro that I daily drove, but all of them tended to exhibit small issues after a while.\n\nMy experience with Fedora has been fantastic thanks to this: Flatpak is wonderfully integrated in the GNOME Software app, it's all a one click install, all updates are handled there, I just never think about my system anymore, I just use it. That peace of mind is something I never truly achieved with any other Linux distro\n\nAnother thing I really like is that Fedora has the DEFAULT experience. They ship the desktop as is, without any meaningful extensions, themes, configurations, or tweaks.\n\nIt's just productivity central. GNOME, for me, doesn't need anything else than the default experience. It is extremely efficient once you wrap your head around how it works, and providing me with a crutch, like an always visible dock, or desktop icons, would just compromise that productivity.\n\nMoving to Fedora also had me learn a few things, especially how to use dnf. I didn't need to use it, but I wanted to; and since I was a lot more familiar with APT, I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nTurns out, Fedora has a huge community as well, something Ubuntu has had since it began, so it's another checkmark next to my \"Fedora is the next Ubuntu\" checklist", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9h_0dnSGWk", "date_published": "2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
