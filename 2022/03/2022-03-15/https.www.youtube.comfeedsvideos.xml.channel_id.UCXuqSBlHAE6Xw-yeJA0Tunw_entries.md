I hope you didn’t just buy a new monitor, because Dell Alienware’s new QD-OLED AW3423DW is HERE and it’s giving everything else in this price range a serious run for its money. It's high refresh rate (175Hz) , GSYNC HDR, and OLED. Have we achieved a zero-compromises monitor?!

AMD announced the Radeon Pro SSG in 2016 combining a GPU and onboard SSD - But when it launched in 2017, practically nobody bought it. Was it simply ahead of its time, or was it truly a dud?
