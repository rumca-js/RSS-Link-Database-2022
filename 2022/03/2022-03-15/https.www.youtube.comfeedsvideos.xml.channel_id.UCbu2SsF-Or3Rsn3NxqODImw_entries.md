Grand Theft Auto 5 is out on next gen consoles taking advantage of some quality of life improvements like faster load times. Here's a video comparing the graphics from various cutscenes and gameplay sequences.

GTA V is now available with a fresh coat of paint for next-gen console owners of the Xbox Series S|X or PS5. In this video we do a graphics comparison using original old-gen PS3 footage compared to next-gen gameplay captured on the PS5. It's worth mentioning that the PS5 was running fidelity mode which maxes out its graphics but caps the frame rate to 30 frames per second. The difference becomes less noticeable when compared to a PS4 Pro beyond certain lighting and shading textures, but when compared to the PS3, the differences are stark.

Be sure to like and subscribe to this video and let us know in the comments how you feel about the next-gen release of GTA V, GTA Online, or what you would like to see from GTA VI in the future!
