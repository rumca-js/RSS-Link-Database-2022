Here's a video comparing the graphics from various cutscenes and gameplay sequences.\n\nGTA V is now available with a fresh coat of paint for next-gen console owners of the Xbox Series S|X or PS5. In this video we do a graphics comparison using original old-gen PS3 footage compared to next-gen gameplay captured on the PS5. It's worth mentioning that the PS5 was running fidelity mode which maxes out its graphics but caps the frame rate to 30 frames per second. The difference becomes less noticeable when compared to a PS4 Pro beyond certain lighting and shading textures, but when compared to the PS3, the differences are stark.\n\nBe sure to like and subscribe to this video and let us know in the comments how you feel about the next-gen release of GTA V, GTA Online, or what you would like to see from GTA VI in the future!\n\n#GTAV", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpGYIRF_V1A", "date_published": "2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "ID@Xbox Showcase Livestream March 16th", "description": "Tune in Wednesday, March 16 at 10:00 a.m. PDT for the ID@Xbox Spring showcase.\r\n\r\nXbox is teaming up with twitchgaming to bring you updates and announcements on the latest independent games coming to Xbox.\n\nGet a glimpse of Tunic, Princess Farmer, Onsen Master, There is no Light, Trek to Yomi, Shredders and more at the latest ID@Xbox showcase!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EioyKE7KNFQ", "date_published": "2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Starfield Made for Wanderers Episode 2 - Behind the Scenes", "description": "Learn more about how Bethesda Game Studios is approaching their latest rich, immersive and compelling RPG experience.
