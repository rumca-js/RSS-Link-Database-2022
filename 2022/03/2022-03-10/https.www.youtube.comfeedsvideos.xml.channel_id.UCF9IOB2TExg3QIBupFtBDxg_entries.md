Adverse Event of Special Interest 

is an event for a particular product that should be monitored by a drug or vaccine manufacturing company. 

It can be severe or non-serious, but it can lead to a serious medical condition.

According to the CIOMS Working Group VII

https://cioms.ch

The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS),

international, non-governmental, non-profit organization established jointly by WHO and UNESCO in 1949. 

Such events should be described in protocols or protocol amendments, 

and instruction provided for investigators as to how and when they should be reported to the sponsor.

The original Pzifer appendix is a wall of words with the diagnoses separated by semi-colons. 

More than 95% of the adverse events listed are life-changing. (for the bad)

If you are lucky enough to have a diagnosis from your doctors and say it is not related to the shot, 

show this list to them. 

Tell them that Pfizer is watching out for those complications. 

Many doctors, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants don’t know. 

I didn’t until I read the whole list.

Many of the conditions below are rare. 

That means a doctor may not have seen that condition before or might have forgotten about them from medical school. 

Rare also means there may be no standardized treatment for them.

The diagnosis on the list does not mean they always happen with the COVID-19 shots, 

but anyone who got “vaccinated” and then diagnosed with the illnesses below should be reported to Pfizer or the VAERS. 

The diagnosis may be months or years after the shots. You can still report them.

The World Health Organization is also keeping an eye on the AESIs. AESI monitoring determines if there is a higher incidence of specific diseases in people who had the COVID shots. 

If the incidence is higher in people who had the shots, they should stop using these “vaccines”. 

That is if they do their job.

This list may be from Pfizer, but ALL WHO HAD THE COVID SHOTS WHATEVER THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPORT THEIR DIAGNOSIS.
