You can still report them.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also keeping an eye on the AESIs. AESI monitoring determines if there is a higher incidence of specific diseases in people who had the COVID shots. \n\nIf the incidence is higher in people who had the shots, they should stop using these \u201cvaccines\u201d. \n\nThat is if they do their job.\n\nThis list may be from Pfizer, but ALL WHO HAD THE COVID SHOTS WHATEVER THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPORT THEIR DIAGNOSIS.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EASM6EzCVeg", "date_published": "2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Florida, no childhood vaccinations", "description": "Free PDFs of my two text books, direct link for downloads, http://159.69.48.3/\n\nPhysiology book in hard copy\n\nhttps://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154770452796?mkevt=1&mkcid=16&mkrid=710-127635-2958-0\n\n0:00 start \n1:25 it is essential that health care practitioners review all data\n1:45 to evaluate risk and benefits, unique to each patient \n2:11 when determining what health care services to provide, \n2:37 including the administration of covid-19 vaccines \n2:53 these decisions should be made on an individual basis (Topic on providing unique care according to individual needs)\n3:15 risk of administering a covid-19 vaccine to healthy children may outweigh the benefits\n3:25 Healthy children aged 5 to 17 may not benefit from receiving the currently available COVID-19 vaccine\n3:39 children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine\nLooking at the evidence \n4:00 risk that may outweigh benefits among healthy children with no underlying conditions\n4:12 limited risk of severe illness due to COVID-19\n5:00 Keynotes: Paper was used in Delta times, you ideally want something more current.
