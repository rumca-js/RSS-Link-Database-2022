I didn\u2019t grow up listening to him, so I just recently saw the video of \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d where he pulls Courteney Cox on stage. I\u2019m only a little ashamed of it. But whenever you get to experience that video, whatever stage of life you\u2019re in\u2026it\u2019s a gift.\n\nSpeaking of GIFTS - wow, what a seamless segue - it\u2019s time for us to GIVE the \u201cBest of 2021\u201d record to you.
