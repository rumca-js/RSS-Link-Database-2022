I'll give an up-close look at this replica and its impressive base, while giving my initial reactions!\n\nCheck out this and Middle-earth United Cutlery products here!: https://bit.ly/3FRrn7f\n\nHelm of \u00c9omer: https://bit.ly/3FRrn7f\nSword of \u00c9omer: https://bit.ly/3GXNB9f\n\n\nOfficial Description:\n\u00c9omer was a captain of the king\u2019s cavalry, Marshal of the Mark, and one of Rohan\u2019s mightiest warriors. He bravely fought alongside King Theoden against the forces of Mordor at the battle of Helm\u2019s Deep and on the Pelennor Fields, skillfully wielding his sword, G\u00fathwin\u00eb, and hurling his great spear. In the final stand against the dark lord Sauron, \u00c9omer fought alongside Aragorn with the armies of Rohan and Gondor at the Gates of Mordor. His steel helm featured a brass horse head nose guard extending across the crest and engraved horse and sun motifs. He was recognized by his kinsmen on the battlefield by the long flowing horse tail that crested his great helm. This authentically detailed replica is a reproduction of the actual filming prop built by Weta Workshop and used in \u201cThe Lord Of The Rings\u201d films presented by New Line Cinema. The helm is crafted of reinforced polyresin and genuine leather, with precisely-molded details and coloring.\n\nWhile this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#lordoftherings #unboxing #collectibles", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hRTdK6DxS8", "date_published": "2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
