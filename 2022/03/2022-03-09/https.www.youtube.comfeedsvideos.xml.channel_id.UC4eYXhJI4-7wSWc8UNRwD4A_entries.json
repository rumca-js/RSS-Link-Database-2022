Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 9, 2022\nIt\u2019s less a concert and more witnessing a master thoughtfully creating an atmosphere, a vibe. And for 13 short minutes, I feel seated in Abdullah Ibrahim\u2019s home in Chiemgau, Germany, witnessing seven decades of experience slowly dripping from his fingers and touching my soul.\n\nAbdullah Ibrahim, now 87, has witnessed the horrors of apartheid. He grew up in South Africa and composed what would become known as the \u201canti-apartheid anthem,\u201d \u201cMannenberg.\u201d Nelson Mandela called him \u201cour Mozart.\u201d He also successfully made music under the name Dollar Brand, and worked with jazz legends including Duke Ellington, Max Roach, Don Cherry and Archie Shepp. In 1968, he converted to Islam and changed his name from Dollar Brand; more recently, he became an NEA Jazz Master. In my 18 years directing All Things Considered, I\u2019d often reach for his music to play between news stories to give the audience a chance to think and reflect. His music is like that; it\u2019s mind-opening. \n\nAnd here he is seated at his piano, his white hair luminous, his fingers delicate, while he reflects on the past and helps clarify the present. The music is from his newest album Solotude, a recording made to an empty concert hall in southeast Germany during the 2020 lockdown, which for me became a source of calm when it was released toward the end of 2021. To witness this Tiny Desk (home) concert, I suggest you take these next 13 minutes, turn off your distractions and discover the strength in delicate reflection from a gentle man who has some much to share. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBlue Bolero\u201d\n\u201cSignal On The Hill\u201d\n\u201cOnce Upon A Midnight\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAbdullah Ibrahim: piano\n\nCREDITS\nDirector / Director of Photography: Tobias Corts\nSound Engineer / Edit / Grading: Florian Epple\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #abdullahibrahim", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5i4stj4M30", "date_published": "2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
