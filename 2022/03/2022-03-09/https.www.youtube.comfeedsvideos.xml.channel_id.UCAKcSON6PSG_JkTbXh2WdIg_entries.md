Gang of Youths' frontman David Le'aupepe joins The Current to discuss the Australian alt-rock group's latest record, 'Angel In Real Time'. Reflecting on the loss of his father and exploration into his family history, Le'aupepe dove into a maximalist approach on the release, "... it needed to be offensive to taste making sensibilities. It needed to be a complete violation of all those things. It needed to not be a downtempo miserable, sad, sodden record that everyone expects. There's this weird idea that somehow you can only convey true emotion with sad quiet intimacies and I resent that. I think it's a very old fashioned way to look at musicâ€”to convey things with huge, enormous, sweeping, panoramic-style songs, I think is just as effective, and we wanted to combine the two sensibilities."
