Reflecting on the loss of his father and exploration into his family history, Le'aupepe dove into a maximalist approach on the release, \"... it needed to be offensive to taste making sensibilities. It needed to be a complete violation of all those things. It needed to not be a downtempo miserable, sad, sodden record that everyone expects. There's this weird idea that somehow you can only convey true emotion with sad quiet intimacies and I resent that. I think it's a very old fashioned way to look at music\u2014to convey things with huge, enormous, sweeping, panoramic-style songs, I think is just as effective, and we wanted to combine the two sensibilities.\"\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
