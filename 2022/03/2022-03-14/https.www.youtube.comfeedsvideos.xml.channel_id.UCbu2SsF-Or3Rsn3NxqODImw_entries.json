In many ways the game is building off of the open world foundation found in developer Tango Gameworks previous game, The Evil Within 2. There's plenty to do in the empty streets of Shibyua with side quests take on, shops to buy from, and collectable to find. The combat, while simple, is increiabley satisfying \n\nBased on his experience, Jean-Luc greatly enjoyed Ghostwire: Tokyo and has high hopes for it as long as it can maintain this level of quality for the rest of the game.
