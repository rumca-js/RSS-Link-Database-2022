In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Putin’s Road to War,” Susan Glasser, columnist at The New Yorker and co-author of "Kremlin Rising," discusses how military force has been key to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rise to power.

“One thing that you get from looking at the whole sweep of Putin’s two decades in power is to understand that, for him, the use of military force has accompanied every step along the way of his journey to become Russia’s longest-serving leader since Josef Stalin,” she tells FRONTLINE.

Glasser is a columnist and staff writer at The New Yorker. She previously served as editor of Politico and editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy magazine. She spent four years as a Moscow bureau chief for The Washington Post and is the co-author, with Peter Baker, of "Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the End of Revolution."

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE's Mike Wiser on March 4, 2022. It has been edited for clarity and length.

In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Putin’s Road to War,” Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute shares her take on Vladimir Putin’s decision-making in the lead-up to the war on Ukraine.

"This was a miscalculation of Napoleonic magnitude," she tells FRONTLINE. "And one of the things we should be worried about now is Vladimir Putin being a rat trapped in a corner and willing to do lots of damage to everything else on his way to failure."

Schake is the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. She previously served at the U.S. State Department, the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. She is the author of several books, most recently "America vs the West: Can the Liberal World Order Be Preserved?"
