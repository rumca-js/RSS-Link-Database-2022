Background

Ivermectin has demonstrated different mechanisms of action, coronavirus infection and COVID-19-related comorbidities. 

Prophylaxis combined with the known safety profile of ivermectin

Study to evaluate the impact of regular ivermectin use on subsequent COVID-19 infection and mortality rates.

Prospective, July 2020 and December 2020

Inviting the entire population of Itajaí to a medical visit to enroll in the program,

ivermectin was offered as an optional treatment to be taken for two consecutive days every 15 days at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day. 

Study analysis consisted of comparing ivermectin users with non-users using cohorts

Results

223,128 citizens of Itajaí considered

159,561 included in the analysis

113,845 (71.3%) regular ivermectin users

45,716 (23.3%) non-users

Of these

4,311 ivermectin users were infected, (3.7% infection rate)

3,034 non-users (6.6% infection rate)

A 44% reduction in COVID-19 infection rate

Risk ratio (RR), 0.56

The regular use of ivermectin led to a 68% reduction in COVID-19 mortality

Deaths

25 (0.8%) deaths in the ivermectin group

79 (2.6%) among ivermectin non-users

RR, 0.32

p less than 0.0001

When adjusted for residual variables, reduction in mortality rate was 70%

There was a 56% reduction in hospitalization rate

44 in the ivermectin group

99 in non ivermectin users

After adjustment for residual variables, reduction in hospitalization rate was 67%

p less than 0.0001

Conclusion 

In this large study, regular use of ivermectin as a prophylactic agent was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates.
