AMD announced the Radeon Pro SSG in 2016 combining a GPU and onboard SSD - But when it launched in 2017, practically nobody bought it. Was it simply ahead of its time, or was it truly a dud?

We're expanding the team behind LTTStore.com so much that we had to get them their own office space, but rather than paying for ANOTHER internet connection we figured, why not share the 10 Gigabit connection we have at the main office... except rather than through a wire... we're doing it wirelessly with the help of Ubiquiti's new AirFibre XG wireless point to point bridge system.
