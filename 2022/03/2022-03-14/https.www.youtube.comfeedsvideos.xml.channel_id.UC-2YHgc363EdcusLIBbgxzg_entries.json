But after 74 years of investigating, dozens of theories, and thousands of dollars in scientific tests, we are closer than ever to uncovering the identity of the man found dead on a beach in Australia in 1948.\n\nQuick note, there are a handful of images used in this video that were from recreations or computer renderings that investigators and filmmakers have made over the years. I've pointed it out when possible in the video but I just wanted to make clear that there are some photos in this video that are not from the actual crime scene.\n\nRyan Twombly is the writer/researcher on this video.\n\nWant to support the channel?
