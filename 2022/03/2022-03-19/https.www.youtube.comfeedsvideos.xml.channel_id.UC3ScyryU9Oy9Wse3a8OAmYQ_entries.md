In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Pelosi’s Power,” Eric Cantor, former U.S. representative from 2001 to 2014 (R-Va.) and House majority leader from 2011 to 2014, discusses his view of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s relationship with the Republican Party.

“Nancy Pelosi is a fierce warrior in the partisan battles in Washington,” he tells FRONTLINE. “She really, I believe, carries a disdain for my party and its opposition to what she’s trying to achieve.”

Cantor is currently the vice chairman and a managing director at the investment bank Moelis & Company.

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE’s Jim Gilmore on Nov. 3, 2021. It has been edited for clarity and length.

“Pelosi’s Power” premieres March 22, 2022.
