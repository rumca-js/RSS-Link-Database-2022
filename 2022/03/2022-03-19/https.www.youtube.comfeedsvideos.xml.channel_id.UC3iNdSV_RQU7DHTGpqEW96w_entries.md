While more and more kids aspire to become famous on the Internet, it's probably relevant to take a look at why more and more youtubers are choosing to leave their channels behind and quit YouTube. It's tempting to watch the big players and fantasize about how great it must be to be in their shoes, or to adopt the hustle mentality and quickly work your way into burnout, but sometimes it's good to listen to the stories of those who've been there and walked away, to understand that life is about a whole lot more than "the grind".
