One of the most exciting things in writing is actually creating the world and characters of a story. But sometimes it can be far more difficult to find a way to make a character fit inside the story. The Five Man Band helps highlight what to keep in mind so the audience is less likely to groan when that character shows up. Give characters a role to play. Never go full Last Jedi!
