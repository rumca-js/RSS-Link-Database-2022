<p>The world's population has sky-rocketed from under 1 billion to around 8 billion in only several hundred years? Should we be worried? Overpopulation has become a huge concern among TED talk enthusiasts and social engineer, but is it more than a meme?</p><p>We survey the classical views of population growth and its limits starting in Malthus's <dfn>Principle of Population</dfn> and how and why his assumptions have been overridden by technological development. Regardless, the 1960's saw a resurgence in Populational Control thinking and the "Zero Population Growth" movement, based in the popular work <dfn>The Population Bomb</dfn> by Paul Ehrlich, but also disputed by the optimistic Julian Simon.</p><p>Still, one of the more novel issues is that of Behavioral Sinks in modern societies: Industrial economies that are so well off that they population ceases wanting to reproduce or continue normal human life. Modern man is becoming more like the pampered rats in John B. Calhoun's famed Mouse Utopia experiments.</p><details>ðŸ“š See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1962-calhoun.pdf">The Mouse Population Sink &ndash; "Population Density and Social Pathology"</a> by John B.
