SARS-CoV-2 infection in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis of standardised seroprevalence studies, from January 2020 to December 2021

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.14.22270934v1.full

We report high seroprevalence in Africa,

suggesting greater population exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and protection against COVID-19 disease than indicated by surveillance data

As seroprevalence was heterogeneous, targeted PHSM and vaccination strategies need to be tailored to local epidemiological situations.

South Africa has had waves

Are African deaths simply unrecorded?

Dr. Thierno Baldé, W.H.O.’s Covid emergency response in Africa

We have not seen massive burials in Africa. 

If that had happened, we’d have seen it

Dr. Abdhalah Ziraba, epidemiologist, African Population and Health Research Center in Nairobi, Kenya

A death in Africa never goes unrecorded, as much as we are poor at record-keeping

There is a funeral, an announcement: 

A burial is never done within a week because it is a big event.

For someone sitting in New York hypothesizing that they were unrecorded — well, we may not have the accurate numbers,

but the perception is palpable. 

In the media, in your social circle, you know if there are deaths

Dr. Demby, Sierra Leone health minister

We haven’t had overflowing hospitals. 
We haven’t
There is no evidence that excess deaths are occurring

ONS

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/infections

6.39% in England (1 in 16 people)

6.35% in Wales (1 in 16 people) 

5.92% in Northern Ireland 
(1 in 17 people) 

9.00% in Scotland (1 in 11 people)

People were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 in the two weeks up to 12 March 2022 if they: 

had not previously been infected with COVID-19 

travelled abroad in the last 28 days 

reported being of White ethnicity 

were employed and working 

had not been living in a multigenerational household 

were male 

were not impacted by a disability 

worked in a care home 

were children or aged around 30 years 
had not had contact with hospitals, or were living in a household where no one had contact 

Reinfections were around 10 times higher in the Omicron variant period than in the Delta variant period

The risk of reinfection was around 10 times higher in the period when the Omicron variant was most common (20 December 2021 to 20 March 2022), 

compared with the period when the Delta variant was most common (17 May to 19 December 2021).  

Between 2 July 2020 and 20 March 2022, people were more likely to be reinfected if they: 

were unvaccinated 

had a "milder" primary infection with a lower viral load 

were younger 

lived in more deprived areas

We’ve got very high levels of infection at the moment, as indeed many other countries do

I think the number of infections is beginning to turn, so we may be quite close or at the peak and it may start coming down shortly
Need to look back at lockdown and dissect 

Clear that there were detrimental effects,

should not be undertaken lightly in future
