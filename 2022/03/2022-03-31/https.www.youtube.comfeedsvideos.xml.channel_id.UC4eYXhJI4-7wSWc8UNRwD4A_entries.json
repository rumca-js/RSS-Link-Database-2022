Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space. \n\nFelix Contreras | March 31, 2022\n\u201cMi padre dice asustado / Que me salga de su lado / \u2018Ellos son marijuanos,\u2019\u201d (\u201cMy father warned me / That I shouldn\u2019t hang out with you all / \u2018They are a bunch of potheads,\u2019\u201d) Los Rivera Destino sings in the song \u201cMis Amigos.\u201d \u201cPero son mis hermanos / Y los quiero asi! (\u201cThat may be, but I love those potheads anyway!\u201d)\n\nThe tongue in cheek ode to pasto (marijuana) set to the classic Latin genre bolero perfectly exemplifies how the Puerto Rican group Los Rivera Destino not only delivers impeccable musicianship and a reverential embrace of nostalgia, but also lots of humor.\n\nAll of that is on full display in its Tiny Desk (home) concert recorded in its hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico. College friends Carlos Figueroa, Fernando Tarrazo and Antonio S\u00e1nchez started out making satirical YouTube videos about Puerto Rican politics. But as music became part of their schtick, they broke out as recording artists with a slowed-down bolero version of the reggaeton classic \u201cTe Bot\u00e9.\u201d Next thing they knew, megastar Bad Bunny wanted to record with them.\n\nThe group\u2019s musical trajectory now finds the three friends seated behind their \u201cdesk\u201d for a performance that is equal parts serious and three-ring circus. Los Rivera Destino\u2019s clever wordplay dominates the first song, \u201cEdgar Allan Poe,\u201d before it launches into a bolero and bossa nova-tinged live version of \u201cCastigo.\u201d Originally recorded with the group\u2019s compay (close friend) Pedro Cap\u00f3, it\u2019s performed here with a four-piece band that displays the kind of musical versatility that seems commonplace in Puerto Rico. \n\n\u201cMis Amigos\u201d is a deliriously funny ode to smoking weed. If you don\u2019t speak Spanish, pay close attention to the translated lyrics, which do a great job interpreting both the meaning and the humor of these incredibly talented comedy writers. The last song, \u201cPancakes,\u201d a loving tribute to the doughy breakfast food, wraps up this visual and lyrical treat of a performance by a group that has carved out a singular place in Latin music. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cEdgar Allan Poe\u201d\n\u201cCastigo\u201d\n\u201cMis Amigos\u201d\n\u201cPancakes\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nFernando Tarrazo: bongos, guitar, vocals\nAntonio S\u00e1nchez: egg shaker, vocals\nCarlos Figueroa: vocals\nHiram Molina: Puerto Rican cuatro, bass, keys, vocals\nDiego L\u00f3pez: keys, sampler, vocals\nDavid D\u00edaz: bass, guitar, vocals\nBennett Service: drums\nJomar Figueroa: whistle, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Guri Bellaflores\nDirector: C\u00e9sar Berr\u00edos\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#eltiny #nprmusic #losriveradestino", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tarsyQZCMUs", "date_published": "2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
