Kyle and Adam are joined by Jarret Lemaster to discuss the recent event at the Oscars and our favorite Hero of the Faith: Joel Osteen. 

We have another edition of Babylon Bee Radio courtesy of Austin Robertson. He serves up the fakest news you can get. And how could you forget Weakly News with Adam Yenser? It’s knee-slappin’ - or face-slappin’ - good. 

Then the three vote on what is or is not heresy from various Joel Osteen quotes by putting a dollar in our Heresy Jar. We also look back on previous Joel Osteen headlines. This is followed by a couple’s account of how Putin is affecting their relationship.
