Sincerely, deeply amazed. Not just by the songwriting and singing, but by their vision and big-heartedness. It feels like such a privilege to witness them creating their first record. Ok, I know I shouldn\u2019t fangirl, but we are truly just at the beginning - we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what s\u00e4je is capable of.\n\nSERIOUSLY - just listen to this! They received a GRAMMY nomination for their first original composition and a John Lennon Songwriting Contest award for their second! So we decided to follow s\u00e4je (rhymes with \u2018beige\u2019) as they began the process of self-funding, self-producing, and self-recording their debut album. They\u2019re the ultimate unstoppable DIY super-group! Hope this video inspires you. It certainly inspired me.\n\nhttp://www.sajevoices.com\nhttp://www.patreon.com/sajevoices\nhttp://www.instagram.com/sajevoices\nhttp://www.youtube.com/sajevoices\n\ns\u00e4je is:\nSara Gazarek\nAmanda Taylor\nJohnaye Kendrick\nErin Bentlage\n\nDocumentary featuring: \nEngineer: Pete Min\nStudio: Lucy\u2019s Meat Market\nKeys: Dawn Clement + Gerald Clayton\nBass: Ben Williams\nDrums: Christian Euman \nSpecial Guest: Jacob Collier\n\n#saje #documentary #grammys", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-hps7RPG0", "date_published": "2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
