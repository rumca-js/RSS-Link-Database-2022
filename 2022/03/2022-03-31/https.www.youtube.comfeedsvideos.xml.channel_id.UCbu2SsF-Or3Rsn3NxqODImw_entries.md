It's time to kick back, relax, and throw some god hands at each other.

Our favorite fighting game about high schoolers who jump into TVs is back on the PS4 and PC. A sequel to the beloved Atlus JRPGs, Persona 4 and Persona 3, Arena Ultimax (known in Japan as Persona 4: The Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold) is a wonderful fighting game and certainly not one to be missed.

GameSpot's Persona Boys; Evan Langer, Ben Janca, and Jean-Luc Seipke, are here to hang out and have a good time with you! Challenge us in the ring or just vibe on this chill Friday.

E3 is officially canceled, Xbox Game Pass could be getting a family plan and Battlefield 2042 is getting major map changes. 

A spokesperson for the ESA told VentureBeat that E3 will return in 2023 with a "reinvigorated showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations." While E3 2022 may not be going ahead, Geoff Keighley's annual Summer Game Fest is coming back this year, though there are no details yet regarding the specifics of the show.

According to a report from Windows Central, Microsoft has wanted to create a Family Plan.
This plan will reportedly use Microsoft's Family Account system already in place for Office 365, and up to five players within the same country can share a subscription.

In a new blog post, Battlefield community lead Adam Freeman outlined all the feedback DICE has gathered from the game's community and the changes it will be making as a result, with most of those initially revolving around Battlefield 2042's Renewal and Kaleidoscope maps. All of those concerns are being addressed and will be coming in the near future.

GameSpot's console crew Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan, break down why Sony's new PlayStation Plus tiers aren't setting the gaming world on fire.

Learn more about what the crew think of this new subscription service from Sony.

#PlayStationPlus #GamePass

After months of speculation, PlayStation has finally announced changes to its PlayStation Plus scheme. PS+ will now offer three tiers: PlayStation Plus Essential, which is akin to the current PS Plus subscription, PS Plus Extra, which offers a library of 400 PS4 and PS5 games to download and play, and the most expensive tier, PS Plus Premium, which offers an additional 350 games from the PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PSP libraries. 

Comparisons are already being made to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's subscription service that offers a rotating catalogue of over 100 games, and day one releases of major Xbox titles. So we gathered GameSpot's trusty Console Crew: Tamoor Hussain, Jordan Ramée, and Lucy James to discuss the pros and cons of PlayStation's new tiers, and the gang are... not exactly impressed. 

For more on changes to PlayStation Plus, as well as updates as to the games leaving and joining Xbox Game Pass, make sure to keep your eyes on GameSpot.
