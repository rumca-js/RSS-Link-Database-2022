The Booster Course Pass will include stages from previous Mario Kart entries and will be released in waves until the end of 2023.\n\nIn this video we\u2019ll be comparing Choco Mountain from Mario Kart 64 on Nintendo 64, Sky Garden from Mario Kart: Super Circuit on Game Boy Advance, and Shroom Ridge from Mario Kart DS on Nintendo DS. Mario Kart 64 was captured on Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online app, Mario Kart: Super Circuit was captured on the GBA Wii U Virtual Console, and Mario Kart DS was captured on the DS Wii U Virtual Console. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was captured on the Nintendo Switch as well.\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass is available now for $24.99, or free if you buy the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass subscription. Wave 1 includes Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. Additional waves will be revealed in the future.

However, unlike the third-person survival horror of those games, Ghostwire Tokyo is something we rarely see, a Japanese-developed first-person shooter. So lets break down everything you need to know about the latest game from Tango Gameworks, Ghostwire Tokyo. \n\nThe game places you into the shoes of a young student in Tokyo named Atiko Izuki, who wakes up after being hit by a car. After, Izuki is saved by KK, not to the singing dog from Animal Crossing, but a mysterious spirit who merges with Izuki a la Shadow of Mordor, giving Izuki new supernatural abilities. This ultimately proves to be incredibly helpful given that nearly all of Tokyo\u2019s residents have mysteriously disappeared, and dark spirits now roam the streets, looking to take down anyone who might still be left. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:24 - Story\n2:08 - Gameplay\n3:28 - Movement\n3:40 - Combat\n5:53 - Developers\n7:12 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ognfavFee8", "date_published": "2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hogwarts Legacy Developer Reacts To Microtransaction Rumors | GameSpot News", "description": "Hogwarts Legacy developers confirm no microtransactions in the game, Hogwarts Legacy is coming to Nintendo Switch, and Valve has improved Elden Ring on Steam Deck.\u00a0\u00a0\n#GamingNews #HogwartsLegacy #EldenRing\n\nJessie\u2019s article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/\n\nPlayers had speculated that Hogwarts Legacy would include microtransactions, but Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood set the record straight over on Twitter.
