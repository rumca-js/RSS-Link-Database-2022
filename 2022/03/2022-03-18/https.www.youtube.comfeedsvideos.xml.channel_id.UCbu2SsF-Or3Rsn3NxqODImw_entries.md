With Wave 1 of the new Booster Course Pass coming to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and bringing back courses from previous Mario Kart games, we've put the old and new courses head-to-head to see the graphical differences.

It’s been 5 years since the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and 8 years since  Mario Kart 8 on Wii U, and while many had hoped for Mario Kart 9, Nintendo has decided to release DLC for 8 Deluxe instead. The Booster Course Pass will include stages from previous Mario Kart entries and will be released in waves until the end of 2023.

In this video we’ll be comparing Choco Mountain from Mario Kart 64 on Nintendo 64, Sky Garden from Mario Kart: Super Circuit on Game Boy Advance, and Shroom Ridge from Mario Kart DS on Nintendo DS. Mario Kart 64 was captured on Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online app, Mario Kart: Super Circuit was captured on the GBA Wii U Virtual Console, and Mario Kart DS was captured on the DS Wii U Virtual Console. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was captured on the Nintendo Switch as well.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass is available now for $24.99, or free if you buy the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass subscription. Wave 1 includes Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. Additional waves will be revealed in the future.

## Ghostwire Tokyo - Everything To Know

Ghostwire Tokyo is a new IP from The Evil Within studio Tango Gameworks. However, unlike the third-person survival horror of those games, Ghostwire Tokyo is something we rarely see, a Japanese-developed first-person shooter. So lets break down everything you need to know about the latest game from Tango Gameworks, Ghostwire Tokyo. 

The game places you into the shoes of a young student in Tokyo named Atiko Izuki, who wakes up after being hit by a car. After, Izuki is saved by KK, not to the singing dog from Animal Crossing, but a mysterious spirit who merges with Izuki a la Shadow of Mordor, giving Izuki new supernatural abilities. This ultimately proves to be incredibly helpful given that nearly all of Tokyo’s residents have mysteriously disappeared, and dark spirits now roam the streets, looking to take down anyone who might still be left.

Jessie’s article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/

Players had speculated that Hogwarts Legacy would include microtransactions, but Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood set the record straight over on Twitter. Following the State of Play and despite no formal announcement from Warner Bros. or Nintendo, the FAQ for Hogwarts Legacy reveals that Hogwarts Legacy will be available on Nintendo's console.

Valve has finally fixed some of the major issues plaguing Elden Ring players on Steam Deck. Although the stuttering issues seem to be resolved on that platform, the issue is still present on standard PC versions of the game.
