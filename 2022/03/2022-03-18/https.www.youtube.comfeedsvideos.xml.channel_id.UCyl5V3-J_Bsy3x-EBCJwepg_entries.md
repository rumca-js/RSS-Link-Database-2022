A new edition of Babylon Bee Radio is hot off the air waves (is that a thing?). Austin uses his sensual voice to give you the fake news that really matters.

Need more fake news? Check out headlines written by kids and some unsolicited headlines from the deep underdark that perhaps should never have seen the light of day.

We also sit down with Patrick Newman to discuss government cronyism. Did you know the government has been corrupt since the beginning of time? Now you do!
