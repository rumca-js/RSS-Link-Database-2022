The latest firmware update has gone live for PS4 and PS5 consoles, adding several new features and tweaking the user interface. Enhancements to Game Base and Trophy cards, as well as accessibility features like mono audio for headphones, have all been added. In a blog post, Sony also teased that variable refresh rate support will be coming to PS5 soon.

From Software has released a new update for Elden Ring in the form of patch 1.03.2. The developer confirmed that this is an extension to the recently released patch 1.03-and will resolve several bugs that were found when it was pushed live.

In the new season of Vanguard multiplayer, players can look forward to a new 12v12 mode called Arms Race. This mode is set on a new large-scale map and calls on players to capture and hold bases.

## Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Dual Wielding Magic Gameplay

We catch up with Brick, now the Punchfather, from Borderlands 2 and test our dual-magic-wielding glass cannon Spellshot and Clawbringer build. Many mushroom enemies were harmed in the making of this video.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands recasts the Borderlands series with a fantasy theme. The game builds off of ideas from Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot adventure, which originally released as DLC for Borderlands 2. In Wonderlands, players are still inside a tabletop campaign called Bunkers and Badasses with Tina as the Bunkermaster. In this part of the campaign, The Tangledrift area, a familiar Borderlands 2 character Brick, shows up to take on the role of the Punchfather, basically a fairy that punches things. The rest of the section is very Jack, and the Beanstalk inspired combined with Borderlands loud and brash humor.

In this gameplay clip, we’re showing off the character class Spellshot. This class is a gun wizard who focuses on damage output and dual-wielding magic. Since this section takes part in a later portion of the game, you’ll get to see the multiclass system in action. We’ve combined the Spellshot with the Clawbringer skill trees, which adds a Wyvern Companion. This multiclass combination creates a glass cannon build where the Spellshot does extra damage but only regenerates shields when casting magic or making kills. In order to kill more quickly, you’ll see us dual-wield wands and rapid-fire lightning blasts with our Wyvern Companion flying around, setting enemies on fire.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands releases on March 25th, with the Season One pass starting April 21st. The game will launch for PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you should be aware that only the two more expensive editions of the game have new-gen optimizations.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but this Borderlands spin-off struggles to find its own identity.

Kirby the Super Tuff Pink Puff is back for an all new 3D adventure, and with its March 25, 2022 release date right around the corner, here’s everything to know about Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a 3D platforming adventure game developed by HAL Laboratory, the company that’s been making Kirby games since the very beginning. It’s not an open world game however, it's still split up into linear levels like previous platforming Kirby adventures. Each stage is a 3D environment with hidden Waddle Dees to discover and optional hidden objects, and some of those stages include boss fights like the two characters I mentioned before, Gorimondo and Clawroline. You’ll also collect Capsule Toys and Star Coins, Capsule Toys are just fun collectibles, and Star Coins can be used in Waddle Dee Town.

To get from level to level there is an overworld map where you can use the Warp Star to fly around, and on top of main levels there are also Treasure Road levels, a sort of race to the finish style mini-game where you’re given a specific copy ability or mouthful mode and have to try and beat the level as fast as possible. Each level has a target time as well that rewards you with more star coins if you hit it. Beating these levels mainly rewards you with rare stones you can also use in Waddle Dee Town.

One of the brand new features in Forgotten Land is Mouthful Mode where you can suck up objects and take advantage of their abilities. Some of the Mouthful Mode abilities we know about are Car Mouth, which turns Kirby into a car for faster traversal and to ram into enemies. Vending Mouth which turns Kirby into a vending machine and gives Kirby the ability to shoot cans at enemies. Cone Mouth which lets Kirby slam into objects using the pointy side of the cone. Scissor-Lift Mouth which gives Kirby a way to reach high places. Ring Mouth which, unlike the doorbell, shoots out gusts of wind which can help push boats across water or spin fans. Lightbulb Mouth can illuminate dark areas. Arch Mouth turns Kirby into a paraglider and allows him to fly. And there’s even Water-Balloon Mouth which fills up Kirby with water that can be used to spray enemies or clean up goo.
