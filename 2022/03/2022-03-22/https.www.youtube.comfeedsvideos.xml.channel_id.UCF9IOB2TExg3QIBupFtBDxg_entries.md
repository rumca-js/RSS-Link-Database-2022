UK infections highest ever in the pandemic so far.

New Zealand

Stop vaccine passes and vaccine mandates for some of the workforce, early April

Stopping gathering limits in outdoor settings

Requirements to use the Covid-19 tracer app when entering businesses.

Vaccines are still hugely effective at preventing severe illness, 

but less effective at stopping people catching and spreading the virus

At the same time, we now have increasing levels of infection-acquired immunity in the population. 

This means that allowing unvaccinated people into places like cafes and bars doesn’t substantially alter the risk of catching Covid there

At least as many people will be infected on the way down the mountain as on the way up, 

and pressure on our healthcare system is likely to remain high. 

Keeping mask rules is crucial to limit transmission

China

All housing compounds under ‘closed management’

Local lockdowns, mass testing and citywide closures

Dozens of officials have been punished or sacked for virus control failures

Only around half of Chinese aged over 80 have been double-vaccinated

For young healthy adults, MODERNA SUBMITS AMENDMENT TO THE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR AN ADDITIONAL BOOSTER DOSE OF ITS COVID-19 VACCINE IN THE U.S.

(Pfizer, 65 and older for 4th shot)

request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,

for an amendment to the emergency use authorization,

to allow for a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273),

in adults 18 years of age and older who,

have received an initial booster of any of the authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines. 

(A booster dose of the Modern, 50 µg authorized for emergency use in the U.S. under EUA for adults 18 years and older)

Clinical trials are ongoing for Moderna's Omicron-specific booster (mRNA-1273.529),

and a bivalent Omicron-specific booster (mRNA-1273.214).

Questions

Will the 4th shot increase antibodies?

Is it an emergency for a healthy 18 year old to get a 4th dose of vaccine today?

Can beneficial endpoints be demonstrated for the individual?

What n would be needed to demonstrate these beneficial outcomes?

Will the 4th shot reduce T cell immunity for internal viral proteins?

If someone has had omicron infection, will a 4th dose increase beneficial outcomes further?

Is it time to end emergency shortcuts and get back to RCTS?

Will there be guarantees a 4th dose will not be mandated once emergency use authorization is granted?

Full FDA Approval of a COVID-19 Vaccine: What You Should Know

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/full-fda-approval-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-should-know

The approval system for vaccines uses scientific data and exacting standards,
to ensure safe and effective vaccines
Review processes include

Clinical trials
The FDA requires rigorous testing of vaccines through a series of clinical trials,

to make sure they work and are safe before authorizing or approving them for the public. 

The laboratories that conduct the trials are independent from the vaccine companies and the government, 

process is not biased.

Risks and benefits

must demonstrate that the benefits of a vaccine are greater than its risks for those who will be vaccinated

Continual monitoring

the FDA may pause the administration of vaccine to do more studies,

and ensure that the problem does not outweigh the vaccine’s benefit.

Manufacturing guidelines

test the vaccine doses in batches (lots),

to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the vaccines remain consistent and reliable.
