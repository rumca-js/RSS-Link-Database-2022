A year after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, around two-thirds of Republican voters believe his election was illegitimate, and the idea that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump is now a defining issue of the Republican Party.

In a new investigative collaboration, FRONTLINE and ProPublica trace the hidden sources of misinformation about the 2020 election, demonstrating how a handful of people have had an outsized impact on the current U.S. crisis of democratic legitimacy.

Watch the trailer, above, for “Plot to Overturn the Election.” The full documentary will be available March 29 at 10p ET.

In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Pelosi’s Power,” Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi offers her own perspective on her decades in Congress and shares details about key legislative battles.

“I said, 'Well, we have an opportunity of a generation,'" she tells FRONTLINE. "We’re not going to let anything stand in our way to pass the Affordable Care Act. If there is a big fence blocking us, we will push open the gate. If that doesn’t work, we’ll climb the fence. If that doesn’t work, we’ll pole-vault in.’”

Pelosi was first elected as a U.S. representative (D-Calif.) in 1987. She served as speaker of the House from 2007 until 2011 and resumed the role again in 2019.

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE’s Jim Gilmore on Dec. 6, 2021. It has been edited for clarity and length.
