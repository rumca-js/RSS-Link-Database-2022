Our first debate quickly spirals into a discussion on how we take back the Internet and build a resilient decentralized infrastructure that is not dependent on any central point of failure.\n\nThe Hated One proposes how Briar, Cwtch and other peer-to-peer solutions could re-decentralized the Internet as it was intended back in the 1990s. Closed Ntwrks talks extensively about how self-hosting is a lot easier and more useful solution for privacy, security and information freedom issues than is commonly understood.\n\nTowards the end of the podcast, we encourage people to get involved in helping open source projects grow, maintain and and expand. Likewise, communities should engage in activism and political movements to force bad legislation out and invite good legislation that promotes Internet freedom and privacy.\n\nAt the end of the podcast, we also share our mobile privacy setups and how we believe GrapheneOS is the most important security project of our time. \n\nThis podcast collaboration between The Hated One and Closed Ntwrk could be the beginning of a beautiful series on the most important topics of the Internet age.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Why Closed Ntwrk makes privacy podcast\n00:03:55 Why privacy matters\n00:07:40 Privacy doesn't matter\n00:19:30 Paying for privacy\n00:21:50 Privacy optimism\n00:29:00 Self hosting is hard but important\n00:36:10 The Hated One's vision of a peer-to-peer Utopia\n00:58:00 The Internet is recentralized\n01:04:15 Hacker wars over peer-to-peer Utopia\n01:08:00 Let's help each other\n01:14:55 Signal is not a long-term solution\n01:18:40: Get involved politically\n01:32:18 Doing away with centralization\n01:51:39 The community needs to support projects\n02:03:48 What is our mobile privacy setup\n02:13:07 GrapheneOS is badass\n02:25:03 Nextcloud and selfhosting\n02:30:34 Extreme privacy decisions\n02:45:15 How The Hated One works and struggles on YouTube\n02:56:25 We will return!\n\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C2z7pViZ4o", "date_published": "2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
