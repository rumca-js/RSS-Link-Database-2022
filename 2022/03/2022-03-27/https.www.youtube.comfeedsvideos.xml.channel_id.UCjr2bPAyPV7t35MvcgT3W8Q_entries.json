This is how you do it. \nBecome a producer of independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nPolice now have the ability to harass protesters with arrests, threats and coercion all the way back to their homes and offices. Attending a protest with a phone will now tell the police exactly who are you, who you communicate with and where you live. \n\nYour phone has four main radio signals, all of which can compromise your security:\n    \u2022 Cellular radio \u2013 is your phone\u2019s most revealing data point. Your SIM card has a unique IMSI number that is broadcast indiscriminately into all directions. The police can capture this number with so called IMSI catchers, find your real phone number and even intercept your calls and SMS texts.\n    \u2022 WiFi \u2013 is the second most common data point. Police can setup a rogue hotspot to trick your phone into connecting to it without you noticing and they can start monitoring your traffic in real time. \n    \u2022 Police can also use Bluetooth beacons to catch your phone\u2019s unique identifier. They could also try to exploit known Bluetooth vulnerabilities to attack your device with malicious payload.\n    \u2022 GPS is broadly used for precise locations services, but this one is the safest data point. Your phone is only a receiver of GPS signals and doesn\u2019t transmit any information. Your phone may, however, store GPS coordinates, which may be revealed to the police if they capture and unlock your phone.\n\nSurveillance is the best tool to silence dissent. This is why if you care about your cause, you are going to have to care about protecting the identity of you and your fellow protesters. Your goal must be to become unidentifiable. \n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive guide to become anonymous in the street.  The goal is extreme anonymity and no middle-ground compromises. This guide will be split into two parts \u2013 Digital security, and physical security. Make sure to follow and understand every step in both of these parts as they are both equally required to remain anonymous.\n\nSources\nEFF's guide on attending a protest: https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest\nIMSI Catchers: https://www.eff.org/wp/gotta-catch-em-all-understanding-how-imsi-catchers-exploit-cell-networks\n- Stingrays: https://www.wired.com/2015/10/stingray-government-spy-tools-can-record-calls-new-documents-confirm/\n- https://www.wired.com/2014/06/feds-told-cops-to-deceive-courts-about-stingray/\nHow to prepare your phone for a protest: https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/06/04/how-do-i-prepare-my-phone-for-a-protest\nProtest privacy - photos: https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/03/12/photos-privacy\nBurner Phone tutorial by The Intercept: https://theintercept.com/2020/06/15/protest-tech-safety-burner-phone/\nRogue WIFI hotspots: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/07/28/flying-drone-can-crack-wifi-networks-snoop-on-cell-phones/\nDataminers spy on social media: https://theintercept.com/2020/07/09/twitter-dataminr-police-spy-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protests/\nAnonymous Twitter account: https://theintercept.com/2017/02/20/how-to-run-a-rogue-government-twitter-account-with-an-anonymous-email-address-and-a-burner-phone/\nFacial recognition in Hong Kong protest: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html\n\nList of all apps and services mentioned (no affiliation)\nGrapheneOS: https://grapheneos.org/\n- Download: https://grapheneos.org/releases\n- Install: https://grapheneos.org/install\n\nF-Droid: https://f-droid.org/\nOrbot: https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/\nTor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/\nAurora Store: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store\n\nKeepassDX: https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX\nTutanota: https://tutanota.com/\nProtonmail: https://protonmail.com/\nSimpleLogin: https://simplelogin.io/\nAegis Authenticator: https://getaegis.app/\nSignal: https://signal.org/\nBriar: https://briarproject.org/\nWire: https://wire.com/en/\nAnonymous Twitter: https://twitter3e4tixl4xyajtrzo62zg5vztmjuricljdp2c5kshju4avyoid.onion/\nScrambled Exif: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/\nImagePipe: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/\nObscuraCam: https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/\nOsmAnd: https://osmand.net/\n\nCredits\nMusic By: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJH-UJyENs", "date_published": "2022-03-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
