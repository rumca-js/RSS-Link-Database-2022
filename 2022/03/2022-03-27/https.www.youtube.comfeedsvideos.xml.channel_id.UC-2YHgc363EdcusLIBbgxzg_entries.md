In 1969, President Nixon created a commission to set the course for NASA's Post-Apollo years. What they came up with was a bold, ambitious vision of the future. One with multiple space stations, moon bases, regular travel to and from space with airline-like frequency, and people on Mars in the 1980s.

It was overly optimistic and naive to say the least. But many of their ideas stuck around and shaped everything that's come since. It's an interesting look at a wild future that could have been.
