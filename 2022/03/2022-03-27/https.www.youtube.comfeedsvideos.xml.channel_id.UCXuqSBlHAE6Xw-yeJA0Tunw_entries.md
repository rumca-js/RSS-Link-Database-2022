Thanks to Kioxia for sponsoring this video! Check out the CD6 NVME SSD at https://lmg.gg/rkDFz

$1,000,000 is how much this entire system costs, not including a YEAR of work hours from different companies to make this happen! Kioxia, AMD, NVIDIA, Supermicro, and WEKA combined their efforts, and they have blown our minds.
