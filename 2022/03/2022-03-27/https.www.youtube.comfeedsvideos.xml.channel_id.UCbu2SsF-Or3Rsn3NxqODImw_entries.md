## History of Borderlands

Few games have promised and then delivered as much mayhem as Borderlands, the loot ‘em up from Gearbox Software. With the release of its spin-off, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, we decided it was time to take a look back, so here’s the History of Borderlands.

Since 2009, Gearbox Software's Borderlands series has been full to the brim with explosions, quirky characters, mountains of loot, and of course, hundreds of thousands of guns to collect. With the release of the latest spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, we thought it was a perfect time to look back on how Borderlands was made, and the impact the series has had on the world of gaming.

Borderlands launched shoulder to shoulder with juggernauts like Uncharted 2, Halo 3: ODST, and Modern Warfare 2 in 2009, but was a surprise hit, meaning that sequels and spin-offs, and pre-sequels weren't far behind. Borderlands was a juggernaut, with players loving its humor, gameplay, as well as mixing and matching the abilities of the playable Vault Hunters. From Handsome Jack to series mascot Claptrap, there's been no shortage of quotable and lovable Borderlands characters. The series also experimented with Tales from the Borderlands, a narrative adventure game made by Telltale Games in collaboration with Gearbox.

In our Tiny Tina's Wonderlands review, Darryn Bonthyus gave the game 7/10, saying that the game is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but struggles to find its own identity. For more on Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, make sure you subscribe to GameSpot.
