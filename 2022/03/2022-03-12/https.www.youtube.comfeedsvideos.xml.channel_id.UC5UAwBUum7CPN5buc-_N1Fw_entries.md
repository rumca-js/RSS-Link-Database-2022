To install Heroic, we'll need to go into the desktop mode, so go to the Steam Menu, then to "Power", and hit "Switch to desktop". Now you're in. Just remember to use a mouse and keyboard, either through bluetooth or plugged in via a USB C hub, because navigating that desktop with the right touch surface can be fiddly, and 

The desktop mode has an "app store", called Discover, it's the blue shopping bag, in the main bottom bar, right after the Steam Deck logo that's also your menu.

Once Heroic is open, just login to your Epic Games account using the login buttons that appear by default. After a short loading time, your games will appear in the library. 

You can now search, download them, update them, download any DLC, and start them. You als have a filter to only display installed games.

You can also access the store with the "Store" tab on the left, and even grab these free games if you want. You'll notice you also got access to the GoG store, so you can login there, and download and install your GoG games as well.

The settings have a few interesting things you can change. By default, your games will install in a Games folder, in your main user directory. You can change that here, and even select the SD card as the default location, if you want. 

To do that, hit the little folder icon, then, in the file manager that opens, go to "Other locations" in the sidebar, then Computer, run, media, then the Sd card name, mine was named mmcb something once I formatted it using the steam deck. Click "choose", and you now have changed the default install path.

In the "Other" settings, you can also toggle an FPS counter, choose to run your games offline, or create shortcuts automatically after installing a game.

Of course, these games will run through the same technology Valve uses on Steam: proton. This means that not all games will work, to check which games have compatibility, you can click the game, then the "Tools" tab, and click "check compatibility". It will take you to ProtonDB, the ultimate resource to see what runs and what doesn't.

By default, Heroic will use the latest official version of Proton, but if the compatibility reports tell you a game runs better with another version, you can also install that. Just use the "Wine manager" in the bottom left of Heroic, and install the version you need for a specific game.

Once that's done, head over to the library, hover over the game, and click the little cog icon. There, you can change the Wine version to the one you need to use. That's also where you can choose so sync saved games, or turn on auto sync to automatically keep your progress in sync with your other computers. You can also add launch arguments to the game, for example to skip cinematics in certain titles.

## The Steam Deck transformed how I play games

The Steam Deck completely transformed how I play games and how I connect with them at an emotional level, and I'm not alone in this...
