Originally built by the Gondorians of the Second Age, Helm's Deep would come to play a pivotal role in the protection of the lands and people of Rohan. Named for King Helm Hammerhand, the defensive system would boast a deeping wall and the great fortress of the Hornburg, named for the king's own horn.  In the later third age, heroes like Théoden, Aragorn, Éomer, Gimli, and Legolas would face off against the armies of Saruman, defending the Keep.
