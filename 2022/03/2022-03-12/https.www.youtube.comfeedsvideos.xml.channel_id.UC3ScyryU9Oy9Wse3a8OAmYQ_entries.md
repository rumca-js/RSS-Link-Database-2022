In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Putin’s Road to War,” columnist Eugene Robinson shares his analysis of Vladimir Putin's ambitions.

"I think he wants to be a great historical figure for Russia," he tells FRONTLINE. "I think he wants to be in the line of Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Lenin, Stalin. I think it's Putin the Great is what he wants to be."

Eugene Robinson is a columnist and an associate editor for The Washington Post, where he writes on politics and culture.
