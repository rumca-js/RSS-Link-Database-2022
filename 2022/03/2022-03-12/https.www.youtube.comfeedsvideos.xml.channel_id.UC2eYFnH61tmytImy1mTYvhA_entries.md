The last of the terminal-interface programs I haven't done a video on: LF the file browser. I have a lot of shortcuts in mine, but also image previews with ueberzug and special icons, and tips as well.

All of my lf configuration files (and those for everything else) are on my dotfiles git repository:

It should probably be in your Linux distro's package repository.
