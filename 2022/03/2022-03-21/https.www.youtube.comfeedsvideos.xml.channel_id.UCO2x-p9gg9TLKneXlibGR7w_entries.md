Robot vacuums have sucked (get it?) at mopping—until now.

In the last few years, robotic vacuum cleaners have gotten immensely more useful thanks to camera vision obstacle avoidance and auto-empty stations. Because, what good is a "do it all" robot if you have to maintain it every day or two? But even as robot vacuums have gotten more maintenance free, they've never been able to tackle a big part of floor cleanup: mopping. Dragging a slightly damp pad behind the robot's path is hardly a pathway to a clean floor and vibrating pads aren't much of an improvement. Not only does the new ECOVACS X1 OMNI actively SCRUB the floor, but it even has a station that periodically cleans the pads, fills up the robot's water reservoir, and even dries the pads after a cycle allowing for truly maintenance-free operation. This video is sponsored, yes, but this vacuum is unreasonably cool and I love it (they can't pay me to say that)!
