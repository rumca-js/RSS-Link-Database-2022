This year we return again, virtually, with another round of Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | March 22, 2022\nSetting the scene with a winding tour of the jam-packed gathering of musicians in a mystical recreation of her childhood casita, Chicago-based singer KAINA offers her Tiny Desk (home) concert viewer a temporally unhinged invitation to come over to her house after school.\n\nIt doesn't take much to imagine what it was like in the vocalist's childhood home: salsa bouncing off the walls, arepas flowing from the kitchen, no one allowed to go home unfed (thanks in part to her Venezuelan and Guatemalan parents). KAINA is channeling that same casita-born energy into her performance here. She opens the performance with the title track to her new album, \"It Was a Home,\" a twinkly piece complete with nostalgic riffs and soft percussion. She mentions that she was featured in Saba's 2018 Tiny Desk, but this is her first time owning the performance herself \u2014 and she hardly takes a beat after the song is over to bask in the glory of her center-stage experience before she takes her time naming every person on stage \u2013 and off \u2013 who built the 15-minute performance. Moving on to her upbeat, zanier number, \"Apple,\" she brings more \"friends\" (instrumentalists, vocalists and puppets included) on screen for the performance. Closing with a full-bodied, chorally-backed performance of \"Casita,\" she once again takes the time to give the voices around her equal space alongside her own.\n\nBut her community \u2013 these featured musicians, the city of Chicago, Latinas across the country \u2013 aren't the only people she's elevating here. She's using this space, her casita and this moment in her career to speak to her inner child, as she describes in \"It Was a Home.\" She's assuring her that when she's all grown up she'll use her voice to shine a light on her casita, beseeching the entire world to marvel at its beauty.\n\nSET LIST\n\"It Was a Home\"\n\"Apple\"\n\"Casita\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKAINA: vocals\nMichael Hilger: keyboards  \nSen Morimoto: keyboard, vocals \nRyan Person: drums \nBrian Sanborn: guitar \nQuinn Cochran: guitar, vocals \nMichael Cantella: bass \nBackground Vocalists: NNAMD\u00cf, Paige Pohlad, Kara Jackson\n\nCREDITS\nDirected & Produced by: Bitchcraft Collective \nCinematographer: Matt Hatleberg\nEdited by: Jack Cronin\nAudio: Brok Mende\nPuppeteers: Frances Farlee, Ashley De La Torre, Quinn Regan, Izzi Vasquez\nProducer: Kaleb Eisenmann \nExecutive Producers: Sar\u00f3 & Matt Hatleberg \nCo-Directors: Kaden Maloney & Rachel Cole \nUPM: Alexis Vergara\n1st Assistant Director: Erica Martens\nSet Designers: Kaden Maloney, Rachel Cole & Alexis Vergara \nSteadicam Operator: Brian Delisi\nB Cam Operator: Luciana Salinas\n1st Assistant Camera: Doug Birch\nGaffer: Ted Holmwood\nKey Grip: Chris \"Skoach\" Owsiany\nColorist/DIT: Spencer Hagerman\nFriends of Friends Recording\n\nSpecial Thanks:\nBryan Casallo\nPogi Studios \nCamera Ambassador \nAtlas Lighting \nMagnanimous Media \nJosh Jones\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen \nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #kaina", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSK5fJpqs5I", "date_published": "2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Yard Act", "description": "Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

It\u2019s a fitting location for the band from Leeds, which has around 70 shows lined up to celebrate its debut album The Overload including the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. Yard Act\u2019s music is filled with brash sounds aimed at capitalism, equality, or lack thereof, and all done with both venom and humor.\n  \nJay Russell\u2019s drum machine sits on a tiny table and kicks off the song, with Ryan Needham\u2019s simple bassline and Sam Shjipstone\u2019s guitar tones setting the backdrop for James Smith\u2019s narrations. \u201cRich\u201d is our opener, a song that James Smith wrote imagining a world where one might actually make music for a living. James Smith told me that it was a kind of \u201chypothetical exercise in what I\u2019d do if all of a sudden I had a lot of money, as someone who\u2019s never had money and never expected to.\u201d The lyrics humorously imagine the song being used in Hollywood films where the protagonist gets rich, and in turn making James rich. It\u2019s a searing, tongue-in-cheek look at capitalism and our money-obsessed culture, a theme that takes different forms through different characters in this wry and compelling five-song set. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cRich\u201d\n\u201cPayday\u201d\n\u201cLand Of The Blind\u201d\n\u201cFixer Upper\u201d\n\u201c100% Endurance\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJames Smith: vocals\nSamuel Shjipstone: guitar\nRyan Needham: bass\nJay Russell: drum machine\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jonny Ridout\nAudio: Pete Flinton, Jay Russell\nRecorded at the Trades Club green room, Hebden Bridge\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #yardact", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id-t3IVNREo", "date_published": "2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
