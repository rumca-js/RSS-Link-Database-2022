In the podcast, The Hated One and Closed Ntwrk discuss privacy, security, surveillance and decentralization. Our first debate quickly spirals into a discussion on how we take back the Internet and build a resilient decentralized infrastructure that is not dependent on any central point of failure.

The Hated One proposes how Briar, Cwtch and other peer-to-peer solutions could re-decentralized the Internet as it was intended back in the 1990s. Closed Ntwrks talks extensively about how self-hosting is a lot easier and more useful solution for privacy, security and information freedom issues than is commonly understood.

Towards the end of the podcast, we encourage people to get involved in helping open source projects grow, maintain and and expand. Likewise, communities should engage in activism and political movements to force bad legislation out and invite good legislation that promotes Internet freedom and privacy.

At the end of the podcast, we also share our mobile privacy setups and how we believe GrapheneOS is the most important security project of our time. 

This podcast collaboration between The Hated One and Closed Ntwrk could be the beginning of a beautiful series on the most important topics of the Internet age.
