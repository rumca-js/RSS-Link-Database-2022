Cyberpunk 2077 gets a new patch, Fuzzy Xbox Controllers revealed for Sonic The Hedgehog 2 sweepstakes, Cyberpunk’s expansion is not switching engines and a Witcher dev promises no crunch while working on the new game.

Cyberpunk 2077 has received a new update, 1.52, that fixes issues related to missing loot, broken animations, and teleporting wrecked cars. Other fixes include clearing bugs in quests like Automatic Love and Path of Glory as well as your vehicle spawning closer to V when it's summoned.

Xbox revealed custom controllers that are not being offered for sale commercially, but fans can enter a sweepstakes to win them. The controllers come in Sonic Blue and Knuckles Red and feature coatings meant to represent real-world hedgehogs.
 
On March 22, CD Projekt Red announced a new Witcher game is in development that will be built using Unreal Engine 5. Despite the studio’s partnership with Epic, it will not disown REDengine anytime soon. CD Projekt said in a statement that the upcoming expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 will be developed using REDengine instead of Unreal 5.

Kirby the Super Tuff Pink Puff is back for an all new 3D adventure, and with its March 25, 2022 release date right around the corner, here’s everything to know about Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a 3D platforming adventure game developed by HAL Laboratory, the company that’s been making Kirby games since the very beginning. It’s not an open world game however, it's still split up into linear levels like previous platforming Kirby adventures. Each stage is a 3D environment with hidden Waddle Dees to discover and optional hidden objects, and some of those stages include boss fights like the two characters I mentioned before, Gorimondo and Clawroline. You’ll also collect Capsule Toys and Star Coins, Capsule Toys are just fun collectibles, and Star Coins can be used in Waddle Dee Town.

To get from level to level there is an overworld map where you can use the Warp Star to fly around, and on top of main levels there are also Treasure Road levels, a sort of race to the finish style mini-game where you’re given a specific copy ability or mouthful mode and have to try and beat the level as fast as possible. Each level has a target time as well that rewards you with more star coins if you hit it. Beating these levels mainly rewards you with rare stones you can also use in Waddle Dee Town.

One of the brand new features in Forgotten Land is Mouthful Mode where you can suck up objects and take advantage of their abilities. Some of the Mouthful Mode abilities we know about are Car Mouth, which turns Kirby into a car for faster traversal and to ram into enemies. Vending Mouth which turns Kirby into a vending machine and gives Kirby the ability to shoot cans at enemies. Cone Mouth which lets Kirby slam into objects using the pointy side of the cone. Scissor-Lift Mouth which gives Kirby a way to reach high places. Ring Mouth which, unlike the doorbell, shoots out gusts of wind which can help push boats across water or spin fans. Lightbulb Mouth can illuminate dark areas. Arch Mouth turns Kirby into a paraglider and allows him to fly. And there’s even Water-Balloon Mouth which fills up Kirby with water that can be used to spray enemies or clean up goo.

Before its full release on April 5, we had the chance to check out a preview of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. TT Games' new LEGO Star Wars game adds character skill trees, a cover-based shooting mechanics, and a melee combo system.

The Skywalker Saga is not a collection of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, and Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens--this entirely new entry in developer TT Games' series features brand-new and original levels, cutscenes, voice acting, hub areas, and gameplay mechanics. Each of the nine episodes can be played in any order, and the storylines of each episode have been tweaked to incorporate details from beyond the nine mainline movies.

CD Projekt Red has finally announced that a new game in The Witcher series is in development. While CDPR isn't ready to share any details on the next Witcher game just yet, the company did briefly touch on the company shifting to Unreal Engine 5 as part of a multi-year strategic partnership with Epic Games.

Sony Interactive Entertainment is buying gaming veteran Jade Raymond's new studio, Haven, in a move that comes after the two companies announced plans to work together on a new IP, a AAA multiplayer experience for PlayStation 5.

Steam Deck now supports Xbox's cloud gaming service. Microsoft says it worked closely with Valve to enable support, which is now available through Microsoft's Edge browser.
