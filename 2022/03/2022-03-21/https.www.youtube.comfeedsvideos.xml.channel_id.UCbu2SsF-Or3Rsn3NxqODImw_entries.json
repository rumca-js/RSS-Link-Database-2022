It\u2019s not an open world game however, it's still split up into linear levels like previous platforming Kirby adventures. Each stage is a 3D environment with hidden Waddle Dees to discover and optional hidden objects, and some of those stages include boss fights like the two characters I mentioned before, Gorimondo and Clawroline. You\u2019ll also collect Capsule Toys and Star Coins, Capsule Toys are just fun collectibles, and Star Coins can be used in Waddle Dee Town.\n\nTo get from level to level there is an overworld map where you can use the Warp Star to fly around, and on top of main levels there are also Treasure Road levels, a sort of race to the finish style mini-game where you\u2019re given a specific copy ability or mouthful mode and have to try and beat the level as fast as possible. Each level has a target time as well that rewards you with more star coins if you hit it. Beating these levels mainly rewards you with rare stones you can also use in Waddle Dee Town.\n\nOne of the brand new features in Forgotten Land is Mouthful Mode where you can suck up objects and take advantage of their abilities. Some of the Mouthful Mode abilities we know about are Car Mouth, which turns Kirby into a car for faster traversal and to ram into enemies. Vending Mouth which turns Kirby into a vending machine and gives Kirby the ability to shoot cans at enemies. Cone Mouth which lets Kirby slam into objects using the pointy side of the cone. Scissor-Lift Mouth which gives Kirby a way to reach high places. Ring Mouth which, unlike the doorbell, shoots out gusts of wind which can help push boats across water or spin fans. Lightbulb Mouth can illuminate dark areas. Arch Mouth turns Kirby into a paraglider and allows him to fly. And there\u2019s even Water-Balloon Mouth which fills up Kirby with water that can be used to spray enemies or clean up goo.\u00a0\n\n#Kirby #ForgottenLand", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suG3-SozEQs", "date_published": "2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The MIX 10th Anniversary Showcase", "description": "Tune in to the MIX\u2019s 10th anniversary showcase, featuring announcements, trailers, new gameplay and more, bringing together some of the hottest developers and publishers around the world.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wksmDMGa4g", "date_published": "2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghostwire: Tokyo Review", "description": "Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to open-world games, but its unique setting, tremendous attention to detail, and singular combat make it stand out amongst its contemporaries.\n\n#GhostWireTokyo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxCh-Y3gEBM", "date_published": "2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga - The Final Preview", "description": "Before its full release on April 5, we had the chance to check out a preview of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.
