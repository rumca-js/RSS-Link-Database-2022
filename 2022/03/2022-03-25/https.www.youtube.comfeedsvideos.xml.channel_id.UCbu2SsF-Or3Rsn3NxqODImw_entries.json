It has more moving parts to keep track of than its predecessors, and it also happens to be the trickiest entry from a puzzle and combat perspective. While the Forgotten Land is still fairly straightforward, there are some tricks of the trade we picked up throughout our time with the game. We've rounded up 10 tips and tricks for Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Our Kirby and the Forgotten Land beginner's guide includes combat and puzzle tips as well as general advice to help you get the most out of your time with the game.\n\nFor more on Kirby and the Forgotten Land we've got you covered here on GameSpot:\n\n10 Minutes of Gameplay: https://youtu.be/jeiXmLpQ0VY\nReview (written version): https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/\nReview (video version): https://youtu.be/pwPe7ntbDBM\nEverything to Know: https://youtu.be/suG3-SozEQs\nThings I Wish I Knew (written version): https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-tips-and-tricks-11-things-you-should-know/1100-6501906/\n\n#Kirby", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6jiuOsHcVc", "date_published": "2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Which Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands Class Is Right For You?", "description": "There are six starting character classes in Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands, and whether you want to be a hammer swinging fire god or a badass dual wielding gun wizard, or you just can\u2019t decide what you want to be, we have you covered.\n\n00:14 - Spore Warden\n03:23 - Spellshot\n06:36 - Brr-Zerker\n11:06 - Clawbringer\n15:01 - Graveborn\n21:30 - Stabbomancer\n\nTiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands departs from the core Borderlands series and allows you to make your own character. Instead of a vault hunter, you\u2019ll play as a highly customizable Fatemaker. When it comes to how you\u2019ll fight, you get to choose one of six starting classes: Brr-Zerker, Clawbringer, Graveborn, Spellshot, Spore Warde, or Stabbomancer. Later in the game, you can multiclass and build your hero using a second skill tree from another class. That means you\u2019ll be able to come up with some pretty wild and powerful builds with the ability to do things like bring multiple pets with you into battle.\n\nIt can be pretty daunting trying to decide on a starting class, so in this video, we\u2019re going to give you a rundown of each and to help you figure out which one is right for you. There are easy solo classes like the Stabbomancer, which focuses on critical damage and can go invisible to escape bad situations. There are team-player classes like the Clawbringer, which can buff the party with fire damage while running around smashing things with a hammer. For original Borderlands fans who love Salvador the Gunzerker, you have something similar in the Spellshot, which can dual-wield magic. Druid/ranger types will love the ranged class Spore Warden. Glass cannon types will appreciate the Graveborn, and Krieg fans will enjoy running into and smashing things with the Brr-Zerker.\u00a0\n\nTiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands releases on March 25 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you need to purchase the more expensive editions of the game for new-gen optimizations. Its first post-launch content season begins starting April 21 and developer Gearbox has said it'll add a seventh class at a later point.\n\n#tinytinaswonderlands", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGyX-93W_Zg", "date_published": "2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Everything We Want In The New Witcher Game", "description": "With novels, games, comics and now a television show, the Witcher is arguably bigger than ever.
