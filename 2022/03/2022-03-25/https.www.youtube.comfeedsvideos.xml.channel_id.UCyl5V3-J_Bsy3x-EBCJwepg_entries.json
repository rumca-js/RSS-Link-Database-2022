We also take a look at several suspicious accounts that haven\u2019t been banned. Weird. We have another edition of Babylon Bee Radio courtesy of Austin Robertson. He serves up the fakest news you can get. And how could you forget Weakly News with Adam Yenser? You\u2019re so insensitive. Dr. Fazale Rana of Reasons To Believe visits The Bee to discuss transhumanism and how it may, or may not, relate to Locutus of Borg. But no one thinks to ask him about Robocop. Sad.\n\nThis episode is also brought to you by:\n\nMy Patriot Supply: https://preparewithbee.com\n\nAllegiance Gold: https://allegiancegold.com/bee\n\nDonors Trust: http://www.donorstrust.org/bee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-HH5q9s4V4", "date_published": "2022-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
