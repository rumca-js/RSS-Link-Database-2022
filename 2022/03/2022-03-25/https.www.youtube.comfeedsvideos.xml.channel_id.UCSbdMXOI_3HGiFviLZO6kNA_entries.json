I have been so excited to cover the HaritoraX, a full body tracking method that doesn't require any basestations or special external hardware- and IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD! I got to try the HaritoraX at CES but finally I got my hands on the full production unit- and I am impressed. Full body tracking for all users, Quest 2, Index, Reverb G2, doesn't matter. Plus, FBT on the go! \n\nINVEST IN THRILLSEEKER MEDIA GROUP:\nhttps://www.startengine.com/thrillseekermediagroup\n\nOutro music:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/etherealdelta/magic\n\nMY LINKS:\nTwitch.tv/thrilluwu\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\nTwitter.com/Thrilluwu\n\nHaritoraX link: https://en.shiftall.net/products/haritorax\n\n00:00 INTRO\n00:55 FULL BODY TRACKING BACKGROUND\n02:00 HARITORAX SETUP\n04:14 TRACKING\n07:32 SLIMEVR/ OPEN SOURCE FUL BODY TRACKING\n10:01 HARITOTAX FUTURE\n11:48 OUTRO", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ4EnAgDA9E", "date_published": "2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
