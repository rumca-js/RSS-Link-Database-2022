Kyle and Adam are joined by Chandler Juliet to discuss The Babylon Bee’s recent ban from Twitter. We also take a look at several suspicious accounts that haven’t been banned. Weird. We have another edition of Babylon Bee Radio courtesy of Austin Robertson. He serves up the fakest news you can get. And how could you forget Weakly News with Adam Yenser? You’re so insensitive. Dr. Fazale Rana of Reasons To Believe visits The Bee to discuss transhumanism and how it may, or may not, relate to Locutus of Borg. But no one thinks to ask him about Robocop. Sad.
