Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 9, 2022\nIt\u2019s less a concert and more witnessing a master thoughtfully creating an atmosphere, a vibe. And for 13 short minutes, I feel seated in Abdullah Ibrahim\u2019s home in Chiemgau, Germany, witnessing seven decades of experience slowly dripping from his fingers and touching my soul.\n\nAbdullah Ibrahim, now 87, has witnessed the horrors of apartheid. He grew up in South Africa and composed what would become known as the \u201canti-apartheid anthem,\u201d \u201cMannenberg.\u201d Nelson Mandela called him \u201cour Mozart.\u201d He also successfully made music under the name Dollar Brand, and worked with jazz legends including Duke Ellington, Max Roach, Don Cherry and Archie Shepp. In 1968, he converted to Islam and changed his name from Dollar Brand; more recently, he became an NEA Jazz Master. In my 18 years directing All Things Considered, I\u2019d often reach for his music to play between news stories to give the audience a chance to think and reflect. His music is like that; it\u2019s mind-opening. \n\nAnd here he is seated at his piano, his white hair luminous, his fingers delicate, while he reflects on the past and helps clarify the present. The music is from his newest album Solotude, a recording made to an empty concert hall in southeast Germany during the 2020 lockdown, which for me became a source of calm when it was released toward the end of 2021. To witness this Tiny Desk (home) concert, I suggest you take these next 13 minutes, turn off your distractions and discover the strength in delicate reflection from a gentle man who has some much to share. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBlue Bolero\u201d\n\u201cSignal On The Hill\u201d\n\u201cOnce Upon A Midnight\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAbdullah Ibrahim: piano\n\nCREDITS\nDirector / Director of Photography: Tobias Corts\nSound Engineer / Edit / Grading: Florian Epple\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #abdullahibrahim", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5i4stj4M30", "date_published": "2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Patricia Kopatchinskaja: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | March 8, 2022\nViolinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and pianist Joonas Ahonen, like most of us right now, are concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kopatchinskaja hails from Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine and declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Ahonen is from Finland, which borders Russia in the east and was once under the Russian Empire until the 1917 Revolution.     \n \n\u201cWe are outraged,\u201d the violinist says. And the music the two have chosen to play, in her Vienna apartment, is appropriate in both its bold surface features and deeper connections. The two movements from Beethoven\u2019s Violin Sonata No. 7 have never sounded more fiercely provocative. No dainty singing line in the scherzo for Kopatchinskaja; her Beethoven cries out with insistence. And the finale finds Ahonen\u2019s piano explosive in its urgency. Beethoven, Kopatchinskaja reminds us, was a supporter of human rights and a defier of despotism. They follow with rarely heard, arresting music by George Antheil, a Trenton, N.J. native and Beethoven devotee, who triumphed in Europe before settling in Hollywood in the 1930s. His Violin Sonata No. 1, with its wailing blocks of sound and mechanical rhythms, defines his 1920s style which has been compared to cubism in painting.\n\nAt age 44, Kopatchinskaja is considered one of today\u2019s most courageous, forward-thinking violinists. Her restless spirit has led her in diverse musical directions ever since she was a youngster. \u201cMy first teacher was the rain,\u201d she wrote in a piece for The Strad. \u201cI listened to the drops. They were the first short, round notes in my childhood imagination.\u201d Thankfully, in this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she allows us to eavesdrop on her teeming creativity.\n \nSET LIST\nBeethoven: Violin Sonata No. 7 in C minor: III.
