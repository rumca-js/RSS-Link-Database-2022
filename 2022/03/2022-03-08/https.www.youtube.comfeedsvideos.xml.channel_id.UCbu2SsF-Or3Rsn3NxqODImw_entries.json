Here's where to find every Sacred Tear in Elden Ring. #EldenRing\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:33 - 1. Church of Pilgrimage, Weeping Peninsula\n0:59 - 2. Fourth Church of Marika, Weeping Peninsula\n1:28 - 3.

First Church of Marika, Mountaintops of the Giants\n6:30 - 12. Church of Repose, Mountaintops of the Giants\n7:24 - Conclusion\n\nElden Ring Sacred Tears are among the most important items in the game. These are how you\u2019ll upgrade your Flasks of Crimson and Cerulean Tears, and as you\u2019d expect from such useful items, you won\u2019t find them growing on trees. Sacred Tears are less random and are found in churches, though actually reaching some of these abandoned holy places is often more difficult than searching high and low for Seeds.\n\nSacred Tears are much rarer than Golden Seeds and increase how much HP or FP your Flasks restore with each use. They\u2019re exceptionally useful as you increase your Vigor and Mind stats, and you can get several early in the game. Sacred Tears are found in churches, though not every church has one. In this video, we show the locations and how to reach each Sacred Tear we've found.\n\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out Tamoor Hussain's Elden Ring review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, \"From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_fvB1uG0o", "date_published": "2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Exoprimal Reveal Trailer | State of Play March 2022", "description": "Capcom is back at it with dinosaurs and exosuits in Exoprimal.

Videos like this one from YouTuber Garden of Eyes show that these buildings are far from empty and may not have just been cut content. In fact, each area\u2019s level of detail has led many to speculate about what these colosseums could be used for. Some guesses across social media include: challenges, special boss fights, and a PvP arena.\n\nThe news comes via a new Halo Infinite development update, where developer 343 Industries has broken down current high-priority issues affecting the game, what fans can expect in Season 2, and updates on co-op and Forge. Clever fans did find a way to glitch their way into Halo Infinite co-op shortly after the game's launch, even if doing so risked corrupting the game's save data and it was more than a little buggy.\n\nSquare Enix and Luminous Productions announced that Forspoken has been delayed to October 11. It was originally set to launch on May 25. Forspoken follows a young woman named Frey Holland from New York City who is transported to Athia, a mystical and fantastical world where she must find her way home.
