Elden Ring Sacred Tears are among the most important items in the game. These are how you’ll upgrade your Flasks of Crimson and Cerulean Tears, and as you’d expect from such useful items, you won’t find them growing on trees. Sacred Tears are less random and are found in churches, though actually reaching some of these abandoned holy places is often more difficult than searching high and low for Seeds.

Sacred Tears are much rarer than Golden Seeds and increase how much HP or FP your Flasks restore with each use. They’re exceptionally useful as you increase your Vigor and Mind stats, and you can get several early in the game. Sacred Tears are found in churches, though not every church has one. In this video, we show the locations and how to reach each Sacred Tear we've found.

If you want to know more about the game, check out Tamoor Hussain's Elden Ring review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, "From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience."

Elden Ring might get colosseum based DLC, Halo Infinite Co-Op gets delayed again, and Forspoken delayed to October. 

Recently, several modders have finally found their way past the locked doors and explored these restricted locations. Videos like this one from YouTuber Garden of Eyes show that these buildings are far from empty and may not have just been cut content. In fact, each area’s level of detail has led many to speculate about what these colosseums could be used for. Some guesses across social media include: challenges, special boss fights, and a PvP arena.

The news comes via a new Halo Infinite development update, where developer 343 Industries has broken down current high-priority issues affecting the game, what fans can expect in Season 2, and updates on co-op and Forge. Clever fans did find a way to glitch their way into Halo Infinite co-op shortly after the game's launch, even if doing so risked corrupting the game's save data and it was more than a little buggy.

Square Enix and Luminous Productions announced that Forspoken has been delayed to October 11. It was originally set to launch on May 25. Forspoken follows a young woman named Frey Holland from New York City who is transported to Athia, a mystical and fantastical world where she must find her way home. Forspoken's original release date of May 25 was revealed during The Game Awards back in December.

GTA V next-gen prices have been released, PlayStation State of Play is coming March 9, and a Dead Space Remake stream is coming March 11. 

Prices of Grand Theft Auto V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions have been revealed and both platforms have discounts that will last until June 14. Unfortunately, existing owners of GTA V will not get a free upgrade when the new versions release on March 15. 

Sony has revealed the next PlayStation State of Play will take place on March 9. According to the announcement, the event will run for about 20 minutes and will mainly focus on games from Sony's Japanese publishing partners.

There will also be a stream for the upcoming Dead Space remake on March 11. According to developer Motive Studios, the event will offer fans early looks at development and what goes into the remake of a game." The stream’s title is “The Sound Of Fear Reimagined. Audio Developer Livestream”, so it seems like it’ll be heavier on what you’ll hear in the game instead of what you’ll see.
