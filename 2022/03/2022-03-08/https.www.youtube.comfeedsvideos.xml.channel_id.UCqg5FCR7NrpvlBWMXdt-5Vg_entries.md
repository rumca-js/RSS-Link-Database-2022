Xbox ended 2021 on a strong note with a lot of momentum, but due to troubles with Halo Infinite's multiplayer, and a lack of updates on new games three months into the new year, a lot of that momentum has slowed down. What's going on?

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
