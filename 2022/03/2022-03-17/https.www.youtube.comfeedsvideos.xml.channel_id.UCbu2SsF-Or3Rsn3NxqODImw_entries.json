However, unlike the third-person survival horror of those games, Ghostwire Tokyo is something we rarely see, a Japanese-developed first-person shooter. So lets break down everything you need to know about the latest game from Tango Gameworks, Ghostwire Tokyo. \n\nThe game places you into the shoes of a young student in Tokyo named Atiko Izuki, who wakes up after being hit by a car. After, Izuki is saved by KK, not to the singing dog from Animal Crossing, but a mysterious spirit who merges with Izuki a la Shadow of Mordor, giving Izuki new supernatural abilities. This ultimately proves to be incredibly helpful given that nearly all of Tokyo\u2019s residents have mysteriously disappeared, and dark spirits now roam the streets, looking to take down anyone who might still be left. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:24 - Story\n2:08 - Gameplay\n3:28 - Movement\n3:40 - Combat\n5:53 - Developers\n7:12 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ognfavFee8", "date_published": "2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hogwarts Legacy Developer Reacts To Microtransaction Rumors | GameSpot News", "description": "Hogwarts Legacy developers confirm no microtransactions in the game, Hogwarts Legacy is coming to Nintendo Switch, and Valve has improved Elden Ring on Steam Deck.\u00a0\u00a0\n#GamingNews #HogwartsLegacy #EldenRing\n\nJessie\u2019s article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/\n\nPlayers had speculated that Hogwarts Legacy would include microtransactions, but Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood set the record straight over on Twitter.
