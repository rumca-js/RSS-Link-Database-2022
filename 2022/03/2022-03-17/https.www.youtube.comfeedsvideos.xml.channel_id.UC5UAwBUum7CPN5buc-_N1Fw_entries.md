KDE fixed their corners:

Heroic Games Launcher is now on Flathub.

Speaking about the Steam Deck, it can now run Windows, thanks to drivers that Valve dropped.

And since the Deck is so popular, every studio out there is outlining their policy towards it, or their lack thereof. Xbox Studios, for example, gave a noncommintal answer, saying that each studio under that umbrella is free to publish games on Steam with or without proton support for anticheat.

There areissues with the "steam deck verified" program

Fortunately, we're going to get a lot more games soon on the Deck thanks to Valve, because they decided to gift a Steam Deck to the Lutris developers.

Still, we do have more than 1300 certified and playable games now on the Deck
