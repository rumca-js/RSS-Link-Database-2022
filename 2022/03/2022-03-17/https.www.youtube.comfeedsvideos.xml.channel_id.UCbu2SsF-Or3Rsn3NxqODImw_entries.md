Ghostwire Tokyo is a new IP from The Evil Within studio Tango Gameworks. However, unlike the third-person survival horror of those games, Ghostwire Tokyo is something we rarely see, a Japanese-developed first-person shooter. So lets break down everything you need to know about the latest game from Tango Gameworks, Ghostwire Tokyo. 

The game places you into the shoes of a young student in Tokyo named Atiko Izuki, who wakes up after being hit by a car. After, Izuki is saved by KK, not to the singing dog from Animal Crossing, but a mysterious spirit who merges with Izuki a la Shadow of Mordor, giving Izuki new supernatural abilities. This ultimately proves to be incredibly helpful given that nearly all of Tokyo’s residents have mysteriously disappeared, and dark spirits now roam the streets, looking to take down anyone who might still be left.

Players had speculated that Hogwarts Legacy would include microtransactions, but Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood set the record straight over on Twitter.

Valve has finally fixed some of the major issues plaguing Elden Ring players on Steam Deck. Although the stuttering issues seem to be resolved on that platform, the issue is still present on standard PC versions of the game.

Elden Ring is still packed full of secrets, so here's our very own Dave Klein (aka DaveControl) with 10 more things you might now know about FromSoftware's latest epic. 

It's not unusual for FromSoftware games to keep secrets hidden for years after their release. While Elden Ring may have just launched, the internet has come together to unpack its secrets, and it's got many of them. Luckily, our Soulsborne expert Dave Klein is here with another ten things you may not have found on your playthrough.

From hints at George RR Martin's involvement, what happens if you kill Melina, to why Gatekeeper Gostoc is such an asshole, we've got a number of cool things that we've stumbled across from playing Elden Ring. If Varre has left you puzzled, or you're wondering how to kick in Elden Ring, or just how to remove the debuff from Fia's huge, it's all here for you in the video above.

We awarded the game 10/10 in our Elden Ring review, with Tamoor Hussain calling it a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.

Supermassive Games announces The Quarry, Elden Ring gets a Thomas the Tank Engine mod, and Elden Ring sells 12 million copies. 
#GamingNews

The Quarry is a  "teen horror" more in line with what players saw in Until Dawn. The game focuses on a group of nine counselors hanging out at Hackett's Quarry Summer Camp on the last day of the season. The Quarry is set to launch on June 10 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

Thomas the Tank Engine has invaded Elden Ring. The children's TV icon has been modded into all sorts of games, and now he can appear right in the middle of the Lands Between. You can find the mod at NexusMods if you want to try it for yourself.
