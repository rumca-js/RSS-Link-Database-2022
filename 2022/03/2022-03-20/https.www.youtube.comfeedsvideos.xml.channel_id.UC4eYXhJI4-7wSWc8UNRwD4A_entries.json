In 2020, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned last March as an online festival. We programmed a virtual \"stage\" of Tiny Desk (home) concerts in 2021 in a series called Tiny Desk Meets SXSW. This year we return again, virtually, with another round of Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.\n\nBob Boilen | March 21, 2022\nBefore the English band Yard Act set foot on stage at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge, England, the band set up its instruments in the green room and performed this Tiny Desk (home) concert. It\u2019s a fitting location for the band from Leeds, which has around 70 shows lined up to celebrate its debut album The Overload including the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. Yard Act\u2019s music is filled with brash sounds aimed at capitalism, equality, or lack thereof, and all done with both venom and humor.\n  \nJay Russell\u2019s drum machine sits on a tiny table and kicks off the song, with Ryan Needham\u2019s simple bassline and Sam Shjipstone\u2019s guitar tones setting the backdrop for James Smith\u2019s narrations. \u201cRich\u201d is our opener, a song that James Smith wrote imagining a world where one might actually make music for a living. James Smith told me that it was a kind of \u201chypothetical exercise in what I\u2019d do if all of a sudden I had a lot of money, as someone who\u2019s never had money and never expected to.\u201d The lyrics humorously imagine the song being used in Hollywood films where the protagonist gets rich, and in turn making James rich. It\u2019s a searing, tongue-in-cheek look at capitalism and our money-obsessed culture, a theme that takes different forms through different characters in this wry and compelling five-song set. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cRich\u201d\n\u201cPayday\u201d\n\u201cLand Of The Blind\u201d\n\u201cFixer Upper\u201d\n\u201c100% Endurance\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJames Smith: vocals\nSamuel Shjipstone: guitar\nRyan Needham: bass\nJay Russell: drum machine\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jonny Ridout\nAudio: Pete Flinton, Jay Russell\nRecorded at the Trades Club green room, Hebden Bridge\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #yardact", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id-t3IVNREo", "date_published": "2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
