It turns out that mothballing an entire terminal isn't quite as easy as turning out the lights.\n\nThanks to all the team at Gatwick Airport! (To be clear, this isn't a sponsored video: I approached them about filming this, and I'm grateful for the access. I did not expect to get out on the airfield.)\n\nBonus fact for pulling down the description: this was filmed on Wednesday, when the cloud of Saharan dust was in the atmosphere. I had to do a lot of colour-correction to make the outside scenes look normal!\n\nCamera by Matt Gray: https://mattg.co.uk\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA3RXeds0_g", "date_published": "2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
