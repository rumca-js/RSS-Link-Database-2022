The streets of Los Santos have never looked better and Rockstar Games is ready to hold your hand through the process. Join Richie as he breaks down the process of returning to Grand Theft Auto Online for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nGTA Online has been around for nearly 10 years and with the launch of the next-gen version, there's no sign of slowing down. Since you may be asking yourself if it's worth diving back into the mean streets of Los Santos with a fresh start, we've made this video to show you exactly what that looks like.\n\nA fresh start in GTA Online can be alluring. You're able to create an all-new custom character, and you're given loads of opportunities to rank up quickly. Not to mention you're given 4 million GTA bucks to get you going. The whole online system has also been streamlined to help new players start off on the right (or wrong) foot. You can now choose from four criminal careers- Executive, Gun Runner, Nightclub Owner, or Biker. From there, the real fun begins. Finding missions, joining crews and ranking up all await first time players. For classic players, the nostalgia will instantly kick in as you re-live early level missions dating back to 2013. Overall GTA Online is in a fun place, so if you're lucky enough to have a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, it may just be worth it to start fresh.   \n\n#GTAOnline", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddEF1i5GP0", "date_published": "2022-03-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Tiny Tina's Wonderlands - Everything To Know", "description": "Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands is a spin-off Borderlands game and takes place inside a Bunkers and Badasses roleplaying campaign. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about loot, guns, magic spells, majestic unicorns, starting classes, the tabletop overworld, co-op, and more.\u00a0\n\nTiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands is Gearbox\u2019s latest take on the Borderlands series and expands on tabletop roleplaying themes from Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. Dragon\u2019s Keep was originally DLC for Borderlands 2. The game is set inside a Bunkers and Badasses tabletop campaign run by Tiny Tina as the Bunker Master. Wonderlands sports a cast of new characters, but features several returning faces as well, like Tina, Butt Stallion, and Mr. Torgue. Newer characters Valentine, Frette, and The Dragon Lord are played by notable voice actors Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s Andy Samberg, comedian, actor, writer Wanda Sykes, and Arrested Development\u2019s, Will Arnett. Ashly Burch, fresh from her star turn as Aloy in Horizon Forbidden West returns as Tina.\n\nThe gameplay in Wonderlands departs from the Borderlands series with changes like a tabletop overworld, random encounters, a host of magic spells, wards, new classes based around the use of swords, hammers, and other fantasy weapons, as well as lots and lots of medieval-themed guns. Players are no longer locked to pre-made Vault Hunters and can fully customize their character, choose a backstory, voice, and pick one of six starting classes: the Brr-Zerker, Clawbringer Graveborn, Spellshot, Spore Warden, and Stabbomancer. Each class can be combined with any one of the other classes later in the game, which is called multiclassing. That allows for min/max builds or just bringing along multiple pets.\u00a0\n\nWonderlands releases on March 25th with the Season One pass starting April 21st. The game will launch for PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you should be aware that only the two more expensive editions of the game have new-gen optimization", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Avvs-hNH8M", "date_published": "2022-03-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
