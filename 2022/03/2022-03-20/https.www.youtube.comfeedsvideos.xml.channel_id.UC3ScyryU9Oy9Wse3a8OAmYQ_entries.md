In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Pelosi’s Power,” David Axelrod, who served as a campaign strategist and political adviser to President Barack Obama, discusses Nancy Pelosi’s early life and how it shaped her political career.

“She is completely formed by her experiences as the daughter of a ward boss and mayor of Baltimore,” he tells FRONTLINE. “She has the sensibilities of an old-time ward boss.”

Axelrod is the director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago and a political commentator for CNN.

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE’s Michael Kirk on Nov. 4, 2021. It has been edited for clarity and length.

In an interview for the FRONTLINE documentary “Pelosi’s Power,” The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson discusses Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump was a bridge too far for her, and she was not able to have those sorts of relationships with Trump or his team,” he tells FRONTLINE. “But with prior Republicans in the White House and in Congress, she was able to talk and laugh and wheel and deal in a sort of way that was at times delightful to watch.”

The following interview was conducted by FRONTLINE’s Jim Gilmore on Oct. 28, 2021. It has been edited for clarity and length.

Cantor is currently the vice chairman and a managing director at the investment bank Moelis & Company.
