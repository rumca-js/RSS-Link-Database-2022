[{"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "The Economy Is Fake, the Jobs Are Fake, the Money Is Fake", "description": "<p>You can't roast people too badly for being \"antiwork\" when most jobs are simply useless nowadays. Surveys have shown that around half of people report either their job is totally useless, or that it's unclear to them if there is any social benefit to their work whatsoever. How has this happened? Why do people put so much effort into what is, in effect, play work.</p><p>We talk about David Graeber's article, book and concept of <dfn>Bullshit Jobs</dfn>, jobs so inane that even the people working them can't justify their existence. This brings up economic questions of hyper-production, the Consoomerist economy, post-scarcity and of course the alleged panacea of Universal Basic Income (UBI).</p><p>At the root of all of it is a public-private plastic economy based on easy and highly inflationary money, which strips people of savings and keeps people working like good wagies from cradle to the grade on jobs that exist just to keep the fake economy going. Comments on the psychological effects of Bitcoin and hard money included.</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://odysee.com/Antiwork_mod_lol:f\">Very funny Antiwork R*dditor appears on Fox News</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/\">The original Bullshit jobs article</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp\">\"Why It's Bad to Have High GDP\"</a></li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00:00\tThe Fake Economy\n00:01:09\tVirgin antiwork Redditor vs. Chad Fox News\n00:03:01\tDavid Graeber's BS Jobs\n00:06:08\tAn example of a BS job in the German military\n00:08:09\tHow many people have fake jobs?\n00:09:22\tIs it just a government problem?\n00:16:12\tThe Coofvid Lockdown and \"Non-essential workers\"\n00:18:31\tDefining Modern Wageslavery and on \"Employees\" and Time\n00:22:52\tThe anatomy of BS job types\n00:25:30\tGoons and Cigarette Ads\n00:27:09\tFake non-software jobs\n00:30:25\tThis is NotRelated.xyz\n00:31:38\tLONG Donation reading\n00:46:12\tThe culture of Wagecuckery and Hyperproduction\n00:49:50\tGraeber and the Wagie mindset\n00:50:17\tUniversal Basic Income (UBI) and Post-Scarcity\n00:53:18\tUBI and the Wagie Uprising\n00:56:28\tThe Inflation Run\n00:59:09\tShould I care about inflation?\n01:00:06\tLife in a deflationary economy\n01:02:19\tWhat are BS jobs in the inflationary economy?\n01:04:38\tWould Graeber agree?\n01:06:01\tInflation as theft\n01:07:07\tWhy high GDP is bad\n01:09:36\tThe example of the Bitcoiner mindset\n01:10:54\tWill gold and Bitcoin destroy the economy?
