Here's our recommended route to take through this huge new area, and how to find the ones beyond. #EldenRing\n\nThe Lands Between is a huge sprawl of various locations, and Elden Ring starts you off in the vast area of Limgrave. While it can take you many hours to examine every nook and cranny and defeat each of its bosses, you should brace yourself for more huge areas to come. You can either defeat Godrick the Golden or skip Stormveil completely, but either way, the next area, Liurnia of the Lakes is ready to present you with another challenge.\n\nIt's easy to get lost, so in this video, our very own Souls expert Dave Klein (aka Dave Control) walks you through the recommended path to get through Liurnia of the Lakes and the surrounding area. He also points out key NPCs and their locations, like Sorceror Thops, as well as where to find Sacred Tears in the area. The path quickly forks, so Dave guides you through Liurnia Highway, Academy of Raya Lycaria, and to the Church of Vows where you'll find another important NPC for those using sorceries and incantations: Miriel, Pastor of Vows. He also advises you on when to tackle Caria Manor, and the Siofra River, both tough areas in the game. This is a very in-depth guide, and there's much more to dig into, so make sure you watch along or use the timestamps if you get stuck. \n\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out Tamoor Hussain's Elden Ring review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, \"From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.\" \n\n#EldenRing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpGR8JLE4c8", "date_published": "2022-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To MORE Cyberpunk 2077 Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Cyberpunk 2077, including Johnny Silverhand\u2019s Malorian Arms, the Palica Smart Shotgun, and, of course, the talking gun, SKIPPY.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:44 - Johnny Silverhand's Malorian Arms\n02:21 - HJSH-18 Masamune\n03:57 - DB-4 Palica Smart Shotgun\n05:13 - DR5 Nova\n06:45 - Kongou\n08:52 - DA8 Umbra\n10:10 - Guillotine SMG\n12:19 - DR-12 Quasar\n14:46 - SKIPPY\n17:50 - Achilles\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down more of the guns from Cyberpunk 20772 and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-oKcfS3dvc", "date_published": "2022-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Triangle Strategy Review In Progress", "description": "Triangle Strategy strips away some of Final Fantasy Tactics' systems while adding extra nuances of its own to make a unique homage.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-to4o-FA30", "date_published": "2022-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "CD Projekt Shows Support For Ukraine | GameSpot News", "description": "CD Projekt suspends game sales in Russia, Nintendo releases a Kirby and The Forgotten Lands demo, and Bungie releases Hotfix 4.0.0.2 for Destiny 2.\n\nCD Projekt, the parent company of Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red, has joined global efforts to levy sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

With a legacy known for cutting edge graphics and astounding attention to detail, GT7 carries on the torch in its PS5 version.

In this comparison video, we put the two versions side-by-side through numerous races, training sessions, loading times, and more.
