<p>Otaci is a Moldovan border town, on the opposite side of the Dniester River lies the Ukrainian city of Mohyliv-Podilskyi. As refugees spill over the bridge that links the two, local people are rallying together to provide them with warm food, shelter, internet and free onward travel in cars and taxis.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Putin's invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February, more than 1 million people have fled across the closest borders. The conflict could result in the 'largest refugee crisis this century', the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months.

<p>The world has reacted with revulsion to stark images of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. But televisions in Moscow show a different story entirely, says Andrew Roth</p><p>When Russian state TV announced the invasion of Ukraine last week, it did not use the words “attack”, “invasion” or “war”. Instead it reported on a “special military operation” in the neighbouring country designed to liberate a nation that would welcome its forces to free it from fascism.</p><p>The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent <strong>Andrew Roth </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that this initial distortion of the facts did not last the week. Instead, as the war grew more intensive and Russian forces met with fierce resistance, there was a subtle change in what Russians were told was going on. Yes, casualties were being taken, major cities were being targeted, but it was a necessary sanction against a government propped up by an imperialist west, determined to humiliate Russia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/04/what-russians-are-being-told-about-the-war-in-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>
