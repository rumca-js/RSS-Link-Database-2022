Polls have shown that around half of people report either their job is totally useless, or that it's unclear to them if there is any social benefit to their work whatsoever. How has this happened? Why do people put so much effort into what is, in effect, play work.\r\n\r\n We talk about David Graeber's article, book and concept of Bullshit Jobs, jobs so inane that even the people working them can't justify their existence. This brings up economic questions of hyper-production, the Consoomerist economy, post-scarcity and of course the alleged panacea of Universal Basic Income (UBI).\r\n\r\n At the root of all of it is a public-private plastic economy based on easy and highly inflationary money, which strips people of savings and keeps people working like good wagies from cradle to the grade on jobs that exist just to keep the fake economy going. Comments on the psychological effects of Bitcoin and hard money included.\r\n\r\n Antiwork R*dditor appears on Fox News: https://odysee.com/Antiwork_mod_lol:f The original Bullshit jobs article: https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/ \"Why It's Bad to Have High GDP\": https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp\r\n\r\n00:00:00 The Fake Economy\r\n00:01:09 Virgin antiwork Redditor vs. Chad Fox News\n00:03:01 David Graeber's BS Jobs 00:06:08 An example of a BS job in the German military\n00:08:09 How many people have fake jobs?\n00:09:22 Is it just a government problem?\n00:16:12 The Coofvid Lockdown and \"Non-essential workers\"\n00:18:31 Defining Modern Wageslavery and on \"Employees\" and Time\n00:22:52 The types of BS jobs\n00:25:30 Goons and Cigarette Ads\n00:27:09 Fake non-software jobs\n00:30:25 This is NotRelated.xyz\n00:31:38 LONG Donation reading\n00:46:12 The culture of Wagecuckery and Hyperproduction\n00:49:50 Graeber and the Wagie mindset\n00:50:17 Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Post-Scarcity\n00:53:18 UBI and the Wagie Uprising\n00:56:28 The Inflation Run\n00:59:09 Should I care about inflation?\n01:00:06 Life in a deflationary economy\n01:02:19 What are BS jobs in the inflationary economy?\n01:04:38 Would Graeber agree?\n01:06:01 Inflation as theft.\n01:07:07 Why high GDP is bad\n01:09:36 The example of the Bitcoiner mindset\n01:10:54 Will gold and Bitcoin destroy the economy?
