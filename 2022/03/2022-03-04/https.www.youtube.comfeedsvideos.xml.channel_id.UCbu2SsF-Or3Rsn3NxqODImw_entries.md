So you finished Elden Ring's Limgrave section and have made it into Liurinia of the Lakes - whether that be by defeating Godrick the Golden or by skipping Stormveil entirely. Here's our recommended route to take through this huge new area, and how to find the ones beyond. #EldenRing

The Lands Between is a huge sprawl of various locations, and Elden Ring starts you off in the vast area of Limgrave. While it can take you many hours to examine every nook and cranny and defeat each of its bosses, you should brace yourself for more huge areas to come. You can either defeat Godrick the Golden or skip Stormveil completely, but either way, the next area, Liurnia of the Lakes is ready to present you with another challenge.

It's easy to get lost, so in this video, our very own Souls expert Dave Klein (aka Dave Control) walks you through the recommended path to get through Liurnia of the Lakes and the surrounding area. He also points out key NPCs and their locations, like Sorceror Thops, as well as where to find Sacred Tears in the area. The path quickly forks, so Dave guides you through Liurnia Highway, Academy of Raya Lycaria, and to the Church of Vows where you'll find another important NPC for those using sorceries and incantations: Miriel, Pastor of Vows. He also advises you on when to tackle Caria Manor, and the Siofra River, both tough areas in the game. This is a very in-depth guide, and there's much more to dig into, so make sure you watch along or use the timestamps if you get stuck. 

If you want to know more about the game, check out Tamoor Hussain's Elden Ring review in progress. He gave it a 10/10 saying, "From Software's latest is a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience."

A new trailer for Kirby and the Forgotten Land has been released today that goes over the game's enemies, the Beast Pack, and the multiple transformations Kirby can use. To help anyone who's still on the fence about picking up the next Kirby game, Nintendo has also released a sizable demo on the Switch's eShop.

In the latest patch update, Bungie is tightening up a number of smaller and more persistent issues in the game, which range from general maintenance to ensuring that players can't abuse an exploit on Savathun's Throne World.

Gran Turismo 7 is another stunning flagship game for the PlayStation platform. Check out our comparison between a base PS4 against the PS5 and see for yourself how the now nine-year-old PS4 holds up against next-gen hardware.  

Gran Turismo by developer Polyphony Digital launches on both PS4 and PS5 systems. With a legacy known for cutting edge graphics and astounding attention to detail, GT7 carries on the torch in its PS5 version. Surprisingly, however the base PS4 version holds up remarkably well for hardware that's nearly a decade old. In this comparison video, we put the two versions side-by-side through numerous races, training sessions, loading times, and more. Our PS5 was captured using "Performance Mode" which focuses on the game's framerate, while the PS4 lacks the option. Gran Turismo 7 March 4th for PlayStation platforms.
