And that, right there, was the night in a nutshell: glum for one side, glee for the other.</p><p>Frank Lampard’s decisions to bring on first the Ukrainian Vitalii Mykolenko and then the former Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli were greeted with the unique generosity of a crowd that cheered five unanswered home goals, and that was as positive as the evening got for a coach whose three away games at Everton have now been lost by an aggregate score of 10-1. In all they have not won a Premier League away game since August, part of a run of three wins in their first four since revealed to be the falsest of dawns.

<p>This shocking drama uses the real experience of hundreds of warehouse ‘pickers’ to tell the grim story of those who enable our internet shopping habits</p><p>It may not turn you full communist by the end of its single hour, but it’s hard to imagine that new screenwriter Helen Black’s punchy fact-based drama Life and Death in the Warehouse (BBC Three) won’t help shift every viewer’s individual dial to walk to an independent shop next time they need something. It’s a grim story of the behind-the-scenes work that provides us consumers with a life of unparalleled convenience.</p><p>Our stage is set in an Amazonian warehouse. I use the adjective to mean “massive” only, you understand. Although the online retail giant Amazon has been accused of and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/amazon-accused-of-treating-uk-warehouse-staff-like-robots">associated with many of the practices</a> depicted in Life and Death’s tale of abused and exploited workers, it has rejected all such claims and its name – heaven forfend! – is never mentioned here. A series of opening captions says only that the recent boom in online shopping has created an invisible army of about 1 million warehouse workers, hundreds of whose experiences at various places have been used as the basis for the drama. “Some of these companies you will know, others you won’t have heard of,” it explains. Between the captions, scenes of a woman miscarrying in a toilet cubicle play out, before we move back in time to where this emblematic catastrophe began.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/life-and-death-in-the-warehouse-review-the-terrible-true-cost-of-online-shopping">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bloomsbury theatre, London<br /></strong>The comic duo offer up another entertaining set as they track their journey through dating apps, heavy drinking and moments of mortification</p><p>Prompted by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/bros-after-the-screaming-stops-review">much-discussed Bros documentary</a>, Flo &amp; Joan’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/15/flo-joan-review-comedys-soho-theatre-london">last show</a> fretted at the acrimonious end to which sibling musical partnerships must tend. This one looks through the other end of the telescope, at the prospect of these “singing spinster sisters” doomed to singledom and a 60-year co-dependency. That doesn’t seem such a grim fate given the fun that Flo, Joan (AKA Nicola and Rosie Dempsey) and their audience have across two hours of their touring set Sweet Release. If its new suite of comic songs isn’t quite as big-hitting as the 2019 vintage, this is another entertaining offer from the Dempseys, crowd-pleasing and well woven together.</p><p>The chat between songs feels looser, too. Nicola, on keyboard, is still taciturn. Rosie, on vocals and sometimes drums, is still dotty. But the dynamic feels less engineered to be awkward than in the past. What seems spontaneous may not be always be so, mind you, given how many casual asides are recycled as lyrics and punchlines later in the show. That brings a neat sense of structure to the evening, whose numbers track the duo’s journey through dating apps, moments of mortification, and – reviving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTViy5WK-EY">a back catalogue hit</a> – nights (and jobs) lost to heavy drinking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/07/flo-joan-sweet-release-review-bloomsbury-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>PM’s plan – already all but forgotten – resembled something a toddler might come up with for a school assembly</p><p>Over the weekend, we were told that Boris Johnson had a six-point plan with which he would lead the west to victory over Russia in Ukraine. However, on closer inspection – and on contact with reality – that plan didn’t seem to amount to much more than you would expect from a toddler who had been asked to come up with something for a primary school assembly to help other children understand the war. Or something that Gavin Williamson – make that <em>Sir</em> Gavin – might have dreamed up.</p><p>1: Get humanitarian aid to Ukraine and be nice to refugees. 2: Support Ukraine’s efforts to do whatever Ukraine wants to do. 3: Increase sanctions on Moscow – though not on anyone we quite like, even if they owe their billions to Vlad the Invader. 4: Tell Russia to shut up and go away. 5: Tell Russia to shut up and go away a bit louder if Russia hasn’t already shut up and gone away. 6: Try to ensure it never happens again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/boris-johnsons-six-point-plan-for-ukraine-turns-out-to-be-six-vague-principles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The mistake was to think Ukrainians were waiting to be liberated by Russian soldiers and that the west was too divided to help</p><p>Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine is a turning point in history. But no one knows who will emerge victorious as one era ends and another is born. Before this war, the momentum was with Mr Putin, whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/21/syria-idlib-putin-assad-winners-iran" title="">military adventurism paid off</a> in the last decade while the United States, humbled by Iraq, turned inward. However, the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine has been a criminal mistake. Russian soldiers are killing civilians, who share a Slavic identity, and flattening cities in land that gave birth to their country’s culture. Mr Putin’s unprovoked war against a smaller, democratic neighbour has resulted in 1.7 million people fleeing their homes. This is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/international-court-of-justice-to-fast-track-ruling-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine" title="">humanitarian crisis</a> on the edge of Europe. If war was just a battle for public opinion, Mr Putin would have lost by now.</p><p>Moscow understands this dynamic which might explain why it cynically undermined peace talks by offering humanitarian corridors for trapped populations only to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-humanitarian-corridors-ukraine-war-mariupol-kyiv" title="">shell Ukrainians</a> who attempt to use them. This bodes ill for talks later this week between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministries in Turkey. Moscow, perhaps for public consumption at home, is seeking to play peacemaker in a war that it started. The Kremlin’s spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-russian-military-action-will-stop-moment-if-ukraine-meets-2022-03-07/" title="">Reuters</a> that Russia was ready to halt military operations “in a moment” if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, such as recognising Crimea as Russian territory and giving two Russian-majority regions independence. It is hard to see how any government in Kyiv could survive in power if it signed such a “land-for-peace” deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-putins-war-in-ukraine-moscows-on-the-losing-side">Continue reading...</a>

Whoever replaces her in the UK’s highest-profile policing job must know that confidence in the police’s approach to female victims of sexual and violent crimes has fallen very low.</p><p>A review of the way that police dealt with several earlier reports about Wayne Couzens exposing himself is ongoing. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has announced that tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG) is to become a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/khan-and-patel-to-clash-over-campaigns-to-protect-women" title="">strategic policing requirement</a>, on an equivalent footing with terrorism, organised crime and child sexual abuse. She has also launched a campaign aimed at highlighting the scale of the problem, and encouraging men to change their behaviour. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/18/new-police-lead-on-violence-against-women-says-trust-has-been-broken" title="">Maggie Blyth</a>, the police’s national lead on VAWG, has admitted that one problem is the attraction policing can hold for men who seek opportunities to exert power over women. With this in mind, it is a relief that efforts are now being made to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/generation-women-turned-off-career-police" title="">recruit more women</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-how-to-convict-rapists-put-experts-in-charge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If the UK is going to need gas well into the 2030s, it would surely be better to get it close to home</p><p>The first lesson of the gas crisis is old and boring: the UK should get serious about insulating its leaky properties. If all homes that have energy performance certificate band D were upgraded to band C, the UK’s total gas demand would fall by 7%, and imports by 15%, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit calculates. Given the UK’s wretched record in insulation versus European peers, that sounds a small but easy win.</p><p>The second part – the supply side – is where the trickier stuff starts. The broad energy direction has been set towards nuclear and renewables, but there’s no getting away from the fact that gas will be in the mix for a long time yet. Virtually all transition scenarios imagine it, and you have to be an extreme optimist to believe UK consumers can quickly be converted to the joys of heat pumps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/07/looking-at-new-north-sea-gas-supplies-may-not-be-palatable-but-is-pragmatic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trine Dyrholm elevates this painterly period drama with a masterfully understated performance as Denmark’s Queen Margrete </p><p>Blending the grand visuals of a sweeping epic with the psychological unease of a chamber piece, Charlotte Sieling’s feature probes the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_I_of_Denmark">Denmark’s Queen Margrete</a>, a visionary ruler who brokered the historic Kalmar Union that – for the first time – united Norway, Sweden and Denmark against the threat of a German invasion.</p><p>But her reign also saw a bizarre mystery in the Scandinavian region, which forms the emotional beating heart of this stately film. On the eve of the engagement between Margrete’s adopted son Erik (Morten Hee Andersen), and Princess Philippa (Diana Martinová), daughter of England’s Henry IV, news broke that the Queen’s biological son King Olaf (Jakob Oftebro) had returned from the dead. This sudden arrival not only unsettled political coalitions but also sent the usually stoic Margrete into a state of distress. Since she was not at his side when Olaf died, her maternal grief encouraged her to believe that Olaf had survived. On the other hand, her monarchical rationality questioned if he was merely an impostor sent to her doorsteps to disrupt a sought-after alliance with England.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/margrete-queen-of-the-north-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What if Henry VIII’s wives were a pop group? The makers of the smash hit recall how Catherine of Aragon was very much Beyoncé, Anne Boleyn had Lily Allen vibes – while Jane Seymour was a sort of Adele</p><p>In 2017, Cambridge University’s musical theatre society invited applications for an original show that it could take to the Edinburgh fringe. Toby Marlow and I were third years at the university, and had talked about doing a musical together for ages, so he applied, saying he would write a show with pop music and lots of women at its centre. Representation of women on stage was in the cultural conversation – later that year #MeToo happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/07/anne-boleyn-tiara-claires-accessories-how-we-made-six-musical-beyonce-lily-allen-adele">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Collaboration drew from monochrome and straight lines of artist’s early work as well as more ‘explosive, feminine side’</p><p>The American artist Frank Stella once said that he “could tell a story with shapes”. Paris fashion week has done this too, all the way from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/02/dior-and-saint-laurent-an-elevated-discussion-between-past-and-future">Christian Dior’s triumphant postwar</a> new look to the more recent apocalypse-luxe of Vetements’ oversized streetwear.</p><p>Stella McCartney, whose clothes tend to be about cool silhouettes rather than embroidery or ruffles, has long felt an affinity with Stella that goes beyond their sharing a name. Stella by Stella, presented on the rooftop of the Pompidou Centre, was both a fashion collection and a celebration of the artist.<br /><br />Stella’s 1988 collage piece Ahab was transposed “pure and direct from the canvas” on to fluid stretch viscose dresses, McCartney said. Other prints were dissected, with elements taken out “to extract something more palatable and wearable” that would be appealing rather than overwhelming on a blouse or dress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/07/stella-mccartney-dissects-work-of-artist-frank-stella-for-paris-collection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wanderlust may be surging once more – but will travel really help us find what we’re looking for?</p><p>In 2019, the United Nations World Tourism Organization reported that international travel had increased to a record <a href="https://www.unwto.org/global/press-release/2019-01-21/international-tourist-arrivals-reach-14-billion-two-years-ahead-forecasts" title="">1.4 billion</a> tourist arrivals. It predicted a 3% to 4% annual increase in coming years. That didn’t happen, of course. At the end of 2021, international tourist arrivals were 72% below pre-pandemic levels with 1 billion fewer arrivals than two years earlier.</p><p>This is despite airlines’ ingenuity. During Australian lockdown, Qantas organised flights to nowhere: one left Sydney for a fly-by tour of Byron Bay and the Gold Coast, the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru; another in May last year took passengers to 43,000ft to see the blood-red supermoon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/07/the-big-idea-is-tourism-bad-for-us-globalisation-flight-holiday">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the first time, a IPCC report has acknowledged the role of misinformation. But it still doesn’t name the culprits</p><p>People who do not spend their days reading climate reports or scouring the archives of oil companies are often surprised to hear that the fossil-fuel industry has been part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since its inception. And it’s not just the IPCC. Oil companies have been involved in the entire international effort on climate change since it began in the late 1980s – and here’s a pro tip: they’re there for a reason, and it’s not decarbonisation.</p><p>The second part of the IPCC’s most recent report was <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">published last week</a>, and it finally acknowledged the oil industry’s biggest contribution to the climate space thus far: misinformation. This was followed closely by another new-to-the-IPCC topic: maladaptation, which refers to measures ostensibly geared towards warding off climate change, but which “may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare”, according to the IPCC.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/climate-solutions-big-oil-ipcc-report">Continue reading...</a>

## There is a heavy burden of being black in white spaces | Elijah Anderson

<p>White gatekeepers repeatedly approach Black people with a disingenuous ‘can I help you?’ It never stops</p><p>When an anonymous Black person enters the white space, often the people there immediately try to make sense of him or her – to determine “who that is”, or to figure out the nature of the person’s business and whether they need to be concerned. When the Black person is unknown, stereotypes can rule perceptions, creating a situation that can estrange the Black person. In these circumstances, almost any Black person can experience distance, especially a young Black male – not as a measure of his merit as a person but because of his Black skin and its indication of “outsider” status in the white space. Thus, such a Black person is burdened with a deficit of credibility, especially in comparison with their white counterparts.</p><p>Strikingly, a Black person’s deficit may be minimized or tentatively overcome by a performance, a negotiation, or what some Blacks refer to derisively as a “dance”, through which individual Blacks may be inclined to show white people and others that ghetto stereotypes do not apply to them personally; in effect, they perform for credibility or for acceptance. This performance can be as deliberate as dressing well and speaking in an educated way or as simple as producing an ID or a driver’s license in situations in which this would never be demanded of whites.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/being-black-in-white-spaces-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fresh from receiving a MacArthur Foundation grant – and releasing an album inspired by Kate Bush and ghostly folk – the daring singer is already absorbed in the next challenge</p><p>In 2020, Cécile McLorin Salvant kept getting calls from an unknown number. Like any self-respecting millennial, she ignored them. “They called me so many times and I didn’t answer because no one answers a number that they don’t know,” she says, speaking by Zoom from her New York apartment.</p><p>When she finally picked up the phone, she “freaked out”. It was the MacArthur Foundation calling to tell her she had been chosen as one of its fellows, an honour that comes with a grant of $625,000 (£475,000) paid over five years. Given that Covid-19 meant her tour had been cancelled, it couldn’t have come at a better time. “It felt like a validation that went beyond music,” says the 32-year-old musician. “It felt like a validation of the way that I think. That’s a huge compliment. It’s the greatest honour.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/jazz-genius-cecile-mclorin-salvant-in-periods-of-loneliness-and-fear-its-instinctual-to-want-to-talk-about-love">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for linguine with white fish and citrus juice | A kitchen in Rome

<p>A simple pasta supper of linguine with white fish in lemony, garlicky oil – just remember to start slowly …</p><p>Driving, jogging, dancing, convincing … Starting from cold is rarely a good idea. Except in some cooking, and especially olive oil in a pan. And especially for someone like me, who for years often began cooking by plonking a frying pan on a flame, pouring in olive oil, adding chopped garlic or <em>soffritto</em>, then marvelling as the little bits seized like cotton in a flame and turned into bitter crisps. Even when I tried to be cautious, lowering the flame and my eyes, there was still a good chance of burned edges. And it always felt like a race.</p><p>The solution arrived like an airdrop; two words, from the cook and teacher <a href="https://terroirtalk.org/fabrizia-lanza">Fabrizia Lanza</a>.<em> Start cold.</em> That is, put the oil, garlic, chilli and zest in the pan away from the heat, away from the stove, on the other side of the room, if need be. Because, of course, it isn’t really cold, but room and hand temperature – ideal for getting things started, a pre-warm-up warm-up, if you like. Only when all the elements are ready, and you have put a pan of water on for the pasta, does the pan go on a low flame. In the case of today’s recipe for linguine with white fish and citrus, a <em>really</em> low flame. The lowest of the low, so the volatile oils and scents in a clove of garlic (peeled and crushed gently with the flat of a knife), a small dried red chilli or pinch of dried red chilli flakes and the freshly grated zest of an unwaxed lemon and an orange can infuse six tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and the room.</p><p>UK readers: <a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000098761&amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe">click to buy these ingredients</a> from Ocado</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/07/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-linguine-with-white-fish-and-citrus-juice">Continue reading...</a>

## Next stop, Sylvia Plath! Why it is time to redraw the London Underground map

<p>The official London tube map has only three stops named after women. Together with the actor Emma Watson and the author Rebecca Solnit, I’ve been working on a feminist alternative. Here’s the story behind our contribution to International Women’s Day</p><p>When I was a baby feminist, I would argue with friends that public space was political. I had been radicalised by my teenage years, sick to the back teeth of street harassment from men who seemed to think that the streets were theirs to roam freely, while women were relegated to decoration. It wasn’t a regular occurrence, but it happened enough times to enrage me. Walking home from school in London, in uniform, I had been followed, had my arm snatched and had been approached at least once by a man who displayed stalking tendencies. As I grew older, I understood these actions as displays of dominance and I was disgusted. Alongside my indignation, I was crushingly disappointed. I had been raised in this city and hated that this kind of behaviour was an impediment to my teenage desire for autonomy and freedom.</p><p>I had been navigating public transport by myself for years at that point, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go. Once I had exhausted my immediate surroundings on foot, I’d take the Piccadilly line to gigs at the now bulldozed Astoria on Charing Cross Road. I’d jump on the Hammersmith and City line, a portal to dancing all day at Notting Hill carnival. The Circle line made me feel like an intellectual in the museums of South Kensington. There was no option back then to outsource travel plans to a clever little app, so in order to go anywhere I, like everyone else, would have to study the tube map to find out how to get to my destination. If I was feeling brave, I’d sometimes jump on the tube at Turnpike Lane and work it out as I went along, peering at the mini maps inside the train carriage and looming awkwardly over whoever was sitting in the seat beneath. I didn’t need a car. The map in my pocket opened up my city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/next-stop-sylvia-plath-why-it-is-time-to-redraw-the-london-underground-map">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No one believed he could make a light gun that worked on modern TVs. But Andrew Sinden persevered with his dream to revive a dying game genre</p><p>Almost every console and computer, from the Sega Dreamcast to the humble Amstrad CPC, once had its very own light gun. Whether you were shooting ducks with the NES Zapper or downing baddies in Time Crisis on the PlayStation, they were ubiquitous – yet now they are all but extinct. Andrew Sinden aims to change that: he’s on a crusade to make light-gun games mainstream again. “I’d consider the project has failed if I don’t manage to do that,” he says.</p><p>It all began around four years ago, when Sinden’s parents were cleaning out their loft. They came across his old NES, and asked him whether he still wanted it. “Of course, the answer was yes,” recalls Sinden. “And what I really wanted to do was play Duck Hunt with my kids.” But after hooking up the console to his television, he was dismayed to find that nothing happened when he pulled the Zapper’s trigger. “I completely forgot that light guns didn’t work on modern TVs,” he admits. “It was a real disappointment, because I thought Duck Hunt on a 50-inch TV would be amazing. I used to play it on a 14-inch TV!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/07/duck-hunt-light-gun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At least 15,000 flights have taken off from UK airports since March 2020 at less than 10% capacity or even with no passengers at all. The Guardian’s environment editor, Damian Carrington, attempts to find out why</p><p>When the Covid pandemic struck in 2020, one of the hardest-hit industries was aviation. Passengers, either confined to their homes under lockdown or fearful of getting stuck abroad, simply stopped flying. But as the Guardian’s environment editor, <strong>Damian Carrington</strong>, tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>something strange was going on: just because planes didn’t have any passengers, that didn’t necessarily mean they didn’t keep flying. These flights, with few or no passengers, are known as ‘ghost flights’.</p><p>According to newly revealed official figures, almost 15,000 ghost flights have departed from UK airports in March 2020 and September 2021. Flying is one of the most polluting and carbon-intensive activities people can undertake and ghost flights have angered those campaigning for action on the climate crisis. Carrington explains that some of these flights are a result of the long-established system forcing airlines to maintain flights in their airport ‘slots’ or risk losing their position to rivals. But this doesn’t explain those flights in the pandemic period when the slot system was paused. So why did airlines continue to fly heavily polluting empty flights?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/07/the-scandal-of-britains-ghost-flights-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
