Here\u2019s the story behind our contribution to International Women\u2019s Day</p><p>When I was a baby feminist, I would argue with friends that public space was political. I had been radicalised by my teenage years, sick to the back teeth of street harassment from men who seemed to think that the streets were theirs to roam freely, while women were relegated to decoration. It wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence, but it happened enough times to enrage me. Walking home from school in London, in uniform, I had been followed, had my arm snatched and had been approached at least once by a man who displayed stalking tendencies. As I grew older, I understood these actions as displays of dominance and I was disgusted. Alongside my indignation, I was crushingly disappointed. I had been raised in this city and hated that this kind of behaviour was an impediment to my teenage desire for autonomy and freedom.</p><p>I had been navigating public transport by myself for years at that point, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go. Once I had exhausted my immediate surroundings on foot, I\u2019d take the Piccadilly line to gigs at the now bulldozed Astoria on Charing Cross Road. I\u2019d jump on the Hammersmith and City line, a portal to dancing all day at Notting Hill carnival. The Circle line made me feel like an intellectual in the museums of South Kensington. There was no option back then to outsource travel plans to a clever little app, so in order to go anywhere I, like everyone else, would have to study the tube map to find out how to get to my destination. If I was feeling brave, I\u2019d sometimes jump on the tube at Turnpike Lane and work it out as I went along, peering at the mini maps inside the train carriage and looming awkwardly over whoever was sitting in the seat beneath. I didn\u2019t need a car.

The Guardian\u2019s environment editor, Damian Carrington, attempts to find out why</p><p>When the Covid pandemic struck in 2020, one of the hardest-hit industries was aviation. Passengers, either confined to their homes under lockdown or fearful of getting stuck abroad, simply stopped flying. But as the Guardian\u2019s environment editor, <strong>Damian Carrington</strong>, tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>something strange was going on: just because planes didn\u2019t have any passengers, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean they didn\u2019t keep flying. These flights, with few or no passengers, are known as \u2018ghost flights\u2019.</p><p>According to newly revealed official figures, almost 15,000 ghost flights have departed from UK airports in March 2020 and September 2021. Flying is one of the most polluting and carbon-intensive activities people can undertake and ghost flights have angered those campaigning for action on the climate crisis. Carrington explains that some of these flights are a result of the long-established system forcing airlines to maintain flights in their airport \u2018slots\u2019 or risk losing their position to rivals. But this doesn\u2019t explain those flights in the pandemic period when the slot system was paused. So why did airlines continue to fly heavily polluting empty flights?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/07/the-scandal-of-britains-ghost-flights-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/07/the-scandal-of-britains-ghost-flights-podcast", "date_published": "2022-03-07 03:00:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
