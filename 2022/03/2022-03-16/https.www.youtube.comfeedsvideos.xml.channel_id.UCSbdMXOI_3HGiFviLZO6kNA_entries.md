Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR  news. I so far have gotten dozens if not hundreds of messages from people that STILL have practically bricked VR headsets due to an odd server outage at Meta, meanwhile V38 drops, the Oculus logo is gone, and turns out, nobody really cares about the metaverse anymore.
