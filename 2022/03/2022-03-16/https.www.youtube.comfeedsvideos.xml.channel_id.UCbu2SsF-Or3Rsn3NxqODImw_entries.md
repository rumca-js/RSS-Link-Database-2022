Elden Ring is still packed full of secrets, so here's our very own Dave Klein (aka DaveControl) with 10 more things you might now know about FromSoftware's latest epic. 

It's not unusual for FromSoftware games to keep secrets hidden for years after their release. While Elden Ring may have just launched, the internet has come together to unpack its secrets, and it's got many of them. Luckily, our Soulsborne expert Dave Klein is here with another ten things you may not have found on your playthrough.

From hints at George RR Martin's involvement, what happens if you kill Melina, to why Gatekeeper Gostoc is such an asshole, we've got a number of cool things that we've stumbled across from playing Elden Ring. If Varre has left you puzzled, or you're wondering how to kick in Elden Ring, or just how to remove the debuff from Fia's huge, it's all here for you in the video above.

We awarded the game 10/10 in our Elden Ring review, with Tamoor Hussain calling it a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.

Supermassive Games announces The Quarry, Elden Ring gets a Thomas the Tank Engine mod, and Elden Ring sells 12 million copies. 
#GamingNews

The Quarry is a  "teen horror" more in line with what players saw in Until Dawn. The game focuses on a group of nine counselors hanging out at Hackett's Quarry Summer Camp on the last day of the season. The Quarry is set to launch on June 10 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

Thomas the Tank Engine has invaded Elden Ring. The children's TV icon has been modded into all sorts of games, and now he can appear right in the middle of the Lands Between. You can find the mod at NexusMods if you want to try it for yourself.

## GTA 5 | PS3 vs PS5 4K Graphics Comparison

Grand Theft Auto 5 is out on next gen consoles taking advantage of some quality of life improvements like faster load times. Here's a video comparing the graphics from various cutscenes and gameplay sequences.

GTA V is now available with a fresh coat of paint for next-gen console owners of the Xbox Series S|X or PS5. In this video we do a graphics comparison using original old-gen PS3 footage compared to next-gen gameplay captured on the PS5. It's worth mentioning that the PS5 was running fidelity mode which maxes out its graphics but caps the frame rate to 30 frames per second. The difference becomes less noticeable when compared to a PS4 Pro beyond certain lighting and shading textures, but when compared to the PS3, the differences are stark.

Be sure to like and subscribe to this video and let us know in the comments how you feel about the next-gen release of GTA V, GTA Online, or what you would like to see from GTA VI in the future!
