I'll give an up-close look at this replica and compare it to And\u00faril and Herugrim - another Rohan sword!\n\nCheck out this and Middle-earth United Cutlery products here!: https://bit.ly/3GXNB9f\n\nG\u00fathwin\u00eb, Sword of \u00c9omer: https://bit.ly/3GXNB9f\nHelm of \u00c9omer: https://bit.ly/3FRrn7f\n\nOfficial Description:\n\u00c9omer was a captain of the king\u2019s cavalry, Marshal of the Mark, and one of Rohan\u2019s mightiest warriors. He skillfully wielded his royal sword, G\u00fathwin\u00eb, and used it to slay many Orcs and Uruks of Isengard that dared trespass into Rohan. He bravely fought alongside King Theoden against the forces of Mordor at the battle of Helm\u2019s Deep and on the Pelennor Fields. In the final stand against the dark lord Sauron, \u00c9omer fought alongside Aragorn with the armies of Rohan and Gondor at the Gates of Mordor. This authentically detailed replica is a reproduction of the actual filming prop built by Weta Workshop and used in The Lord Of The Rings films presented by New Line Cinema. This 34\u201d long sword was made using only the finest grade materials and craftsmanship available. It features brass-finished, cast metal hilt parts, a genuine leather-wrapped grip, and a 27\u201d stainless steel blade with engraved fuller grooves.\n\nWhile this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#lordoftherings #unboxing #lotr", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlXAoxsypLM", "date_published": "2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
