Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | March 17, 2022\nOur Tiny Desk (home) concert series has brought us to some very special places, but few can match the distinction of being inside Ludwig Van Beethoven\u2019s house.\n \nViolinist Daniel Hope is the current president of Beethoven-Haus, where the great composer was born in 1770 in Bonn, Germany. Far more than a cultural curiosity, the house is, as Hope calls it, \u201cthe nerve center\u201d for dozens of Beethoven scholars. It\u2019s also a museum, library, publishing house and performance space.    \n \nWe often ask artists to perform at their own \u201ctiny desk\u201d of some sort. But the desk in this concert cannot be matched. On display, in front of Hope and pianist Sylvia Thereza, is Beethoven\u2019s own traveling desk, a compact model he used to write letters and perhaps compose music. \n \nThe music Hope chose for this special performance makes a most unexpected connection between Beethoven and St. Patrick\u2019s Day. Beginning around 1810, Beethoven was commissioned to arrange his own versions of folk tunes from the British Isles. These were intended for amateurs to play at home, but with Beethoven nothing was ever easy. One of these tunes, a theme with variations, is called \u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Day,\u201d which fits with Hope\u2019s Irish heritage. The violinist begins with a bittersweet arrangement of the Londonderry Air, better known as \u201cDanny Boy\u201d when sung. But the soul of this concert is surely the slow movement of Beethoven\u2019s Sixth Violin Sonata, with its aching melody that unfolds like prayerful song, wafting through the halls where the composer once walked.  \n \nSET LIST\nTraditional: \u201cLondonderry Air (Danny Boy)\u201d\nBeethoven: Violin Sonata No. 6 in A: II.
