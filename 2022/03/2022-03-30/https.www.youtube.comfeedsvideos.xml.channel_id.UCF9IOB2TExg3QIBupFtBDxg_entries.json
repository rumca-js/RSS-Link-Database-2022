against COVID-19 disease than indicated by surveillance data\n\nAs seroprevalence was heterogeneous, targeted PHSM and vaccination strategies need to be tailored to local epidemiological

numbers,\n\nbut the perception is palpable. \n\nIn the media, in your social circle, you know if there are deaths\n\nDr. Demby, Sierra Leone health minister\n\nWe haven\u2019t had overflowing
