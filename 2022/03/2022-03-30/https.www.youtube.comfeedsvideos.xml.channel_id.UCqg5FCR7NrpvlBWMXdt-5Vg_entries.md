Sony has revealed their the new PlayStation Plus model with updated tiers to compete with Microsoft's Game Pass, but we're wondering if they're making a mistake to not include their first party games at launch on the service through any tier. Oh, and the sequel to Breath of the Wild 2 got delayed again, so we'll talk about that.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
