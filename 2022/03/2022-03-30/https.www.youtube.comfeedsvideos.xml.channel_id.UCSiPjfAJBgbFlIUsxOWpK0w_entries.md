I am just amazed by säje. Sincerely, deeply amazed. Not just by the songwriting and singing, but by their vision and big-heartedness. It feels like such a privilege to witness them creating their first record. Ok, I know I shouldn’t fangirl, but we are truly just at the beginning - we’ve only scratched the surface of what säje is capable of.

SERIOUSLY - just listen to this! They received a GRAMMY nomination for their first original composition and a John Lennon Songwriting Contest award for their second! So we decided to follow säje (rhymes with ‘beige’) as they began the process of self-funding, self-producing, and self-recording their debut album. They’re the ultimate unstoppable DIY super-group! Hope this video inspires you. It certainly inspired me.
