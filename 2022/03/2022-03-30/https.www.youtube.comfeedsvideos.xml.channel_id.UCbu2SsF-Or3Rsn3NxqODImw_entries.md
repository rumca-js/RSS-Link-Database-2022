E3 is officially canceled, Xbox Game Pass could be getting a family plan and Battlefield 2042 is getting major map changes. 

A spokesperson for the ESA told VentureBeat that E3 will return in 2023 with a "reinvigorated showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations." While E3 2022 may not be going ahead, Geoff Keighley's annual Summer Game Fest is coming back this year, though there are no details yet regarding the specifics of the show.

According to a report from Windows Central, Microsoft has wanted to create a Family Plan.
This plan will reportedly use Microsoft's Family Account system already in place for Office 365, and up to five players within the same country can share a subscription.

In a new blog post, Battlefield community lead Adam Freeman outlined all the feedback DICE has gathered from the game's community and the changes it will be making as a result, with most of those initially revolving around Battlefield 2042's Renewal and Kaleidoscope maps. All of those concerns are being addressed and will be coming in the near future.

After months of speculation, PlayStation has finally announced changes to its PlayStation Plus scheme. PS+ will now offer three tiers: PlayStation Plus Essential, which is akin to the current PS Plus subscription, PS Plus Extra, which offers a library of 400 PS4 and PS5 games to download and play, and the most expensive tier, PS Plus Premium, which offers an additional 350 games from the PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PSP libraries. 

Comparisons are already being made to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's subscription service that offers a rotating catalogue of over 100 games, and day one releases of major Xbox titles. So we gathered GameSpot's trusty Console Crew: Tamoor Hussain, Jordan Ramée, and Lucy James to discuss the pros and cons of PlayStation's new tiers, and the gang are... not exactly impressed. 

For more on changes to PlayStation Plus, as well as updates as to the games leaving and joining Xbox Game Pass, make sure to keep your eyes on GameSpot.

Sony has finally announced its new version of PlayStation Plus, which combines PS Plus and PS Now into a single offering with additional, more expensive tiers available for those seeking extra benefits. Let's compare it to Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass to see how the two popular membership programs in the console space match up. 

#PlayStation #Xbox

After months of speculation, Sony has finally and formally announced the changes it will be making to its PlayStation Plus online service. Launched in 2010, PS Plus has offered free games, cloud storage, access to multiplayer, and discounts on items available on the PlayStation Store. Ever since Xbox launched Game Pass, its subscription service that allows players to download and play games from a rotating catalogue of titles, people have been asking if PlayStation would change PlayStation Plus to compete. 

In this video, we break down the three tiers of the new PlayStation Plus: PlayStation Plus Essential, PlayStation Plus Extra, and PlayStation Plus Premium, and compare their pricing, the games available at each tier, and other benefits, like streaming PlayStation, PS2, PS3, PS, and PSP games. We also compare it to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's offerings, which allows players to play on both an Xbox console and PC, as well as use xCloud streaming technology to play games. 

The changes to PlayStation Plus will be rolling out in June 2022, for more on the changes to the service, as well as the list of the games that will be available, make sure you subscribe to GameSpot.
