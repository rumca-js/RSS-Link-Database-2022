Kyle and Adam are joined by Chandler Juliet to discuss The Babylon Bee’s recent ban from Twitter. We also take a look at several suspicious accounts that haven’t been banned. Weird. We have another edition of Babylon Bee Radio courtesy of Austin Robertson. He serves up the fakest news you can get. And how could you forget Weakly News with Adam Yenser? You’re so insensitive. Dr. Fazale Rana of Reasons To Believe visits The Bee to discuss transhumanism and how it may, or may not, relate to Locutus of Borg. But no one thinks to ask him about Robocop. Sad.

Accomplished radio host—and almost Governor of California—Larry Elder stopped by The Babylon Bee studio to talk about being the black face of white supremacy and to give his thoughts on the recall campaign, that gorilla lady who threw eggs at him, and whether the future of California is truly hopeless. Editor-in-Chief Kyle Mann and Adam Yenser ask the questions in this hard-hitting Babylon Bee interview before inviting Larry to blow off some steam with some eggs we found.

This clever husband has found a way to avoid all his responsibilities: he just deflects blame onto Vladimir Putin. Smart!
