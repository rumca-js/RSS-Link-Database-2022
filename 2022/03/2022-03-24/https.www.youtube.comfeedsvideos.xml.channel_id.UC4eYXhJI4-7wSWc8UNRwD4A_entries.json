In 2020, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned last March as an online festival. We programmed a virtual \"stage\" of Tiny Desk (home) concerts in 2021 in a series called Tiny Desk Meets SXSW. This year we return again, virtually, with another round of Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.\n\nBobby Carter | March 23, 2022\n\u201cI ain\u2019t about to be on all that preaching s***, but Imma tell you this,\u201d Maxo Kream says during his Tiny Desk (home) concert. \u201cI came from nothing! The mud. Anything you wanna do, put your mind to it.\u201d The sentiment isn\u2019t groundbreaking, but if you\u2019ve made it to the point in the video at which he says this, it\u2019s impossible not to feel the passion of these words. His set is one of the first times we\u2019ve seen the Houston native play with a band. They set up shop in an H-Town performance space, and the stripped-down aesthetic brings things that could be easily lost in his album recordings. The rawness of his voice cuts straight through the live instrumentation. \n\nMaxo Kream\u2019s Tiny Desk (home) concert exemplifies the importance of storytelling in hip-hop music. His discography deals in-depth with the family struggle. It\u2019s also a reminder for all of us to listen to the whole story. Otherwise, you inevitably miss a crucial piece of the incredibly complex puzzle of his life: poverty, gang culture, his complicated relationship with his parents as an immigrant son. He\u2019s named after his father, Emekwanem Ogugua Biosah Sr., who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria. While the setlist veers heavily toward the trauma Maxo has endured throughout his life with songs like \u201cRoaches,\u201d \u201cMAMA\u2019S PURSE\u201d and \u201cFRFR,\u201d he triumphantly contrasts the performance with insight between songs that indicate that much of what he raps about is now in his rearview.  \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cTHEY SAY\u201d\n\u201cRoaches\u201d\n\u201cFRFR\u201d\n\u201cMAMA'S PURSE\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nMaxo Kream: vocals\nOscar Santander: arrangements, piano, guitar\nNicco Martinez: guitar, piano\nTony Bautista: bass\nIan McGilber: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Screenville Films\nAudio: Alfredo De la Garza, Gabriel Medina\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #maxokream", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5de8UjLRZBI", "date_published": "2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
