Tesla released its public beta for the "full-self driving" autonomous package that has been promised for over 6 years. After being frustrated with paying for and never receiving any FSD features on my Tesla Model 3, I decided not to opt for the package when purchasing my Tesla Model Y. Not to mention that the price of FSD has risen to a ludicrous $12,000. But, Papa Elon finally delivered. Can the promise of FSD possibly hold up or is it all just one elaborate scam? In this video, we'll test Tesla Full Self-Driving and identify its strengths and many weaknesses that need improvement before even thinking about a wide public release.
