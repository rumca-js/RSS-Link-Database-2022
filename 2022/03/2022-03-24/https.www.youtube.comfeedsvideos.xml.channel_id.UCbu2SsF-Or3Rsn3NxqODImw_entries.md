According to a report from The Exputer, Rainbow Six Siege mobile game will be revealed on April 6. The project is developed by Ubisoft in collaboration with Tencent's WeGame and Mobile games based on Assassin's Creed and The Division are also reportedly in the works. 

Pre-production has reportedly begun on the next Battlefield game, and will see the series revert to its familiar roots after changes introduced in Battlefield 2042 weren't well-received. As for Battlefield 2042's future, EA and DICE are still required to release new specialists, modes, weapons, vehicles, and maps as part of its battle pass obligations

According to Raven Software developer Josh Bridge,  Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, Verdansk, will not come back due to a technical issue preventing this from being possible. Instead, Activision is putting more effort into technical optimizations for Warzone to allow for big updates without such massive downloads.
