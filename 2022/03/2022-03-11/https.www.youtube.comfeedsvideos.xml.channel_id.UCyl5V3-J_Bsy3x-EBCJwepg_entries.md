This week The Babylon Bee discusses how insane gas prices are. Biden seems to think it’s entirely Russia’s fault but we know he’s just being modest. Kyle, Adam, and Jarret also discuss their personal top ten Sci-Fi films (but no one picks The Last Jedi? Weird.) We also sit down with Carl Trueman, the author of a very thick book called The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism, and the Road to Sexual Revolution. He now has a shorter, more approachable book covering the same ground called Strange New World.
