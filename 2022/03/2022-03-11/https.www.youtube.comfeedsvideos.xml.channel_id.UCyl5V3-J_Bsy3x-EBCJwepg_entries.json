Biden seems to think it\u2019s entirely Russia\u2019s fault but we know he\u2019s just being modest. Kyle, Adam, and Jarret also discuss their personal top ten Sci-Fi films (but no one picks The Last Jedi? Weird.) We also sit down with Carl Trueman, the author of a very thick book called The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism, and the Road to Sexual Revolution. He now has a shorter, more approachable book covering the same ground called Strange New World.\n\nYou can pre-order Dr. Carl Trueman\u2019s new book Strange New World now: https://www.amazon.com/Strange-New-World-Activists-Revolution-ebook/dp/B09J1L27BR\n\nFor the much larger book, check out The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism, and the Road to Sexual Revolution: https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Triumph-Modern-Self-Individualism/dp/1433556332\n\nThis episode is also brought to you by Daily Nouri: https://dailynouri.com/\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Private Internet Access: https://privateinternetaccess.com/TheBabylonBee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLWm9OXAiHU", "date_published": "2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
