(for the bad)\n\nIf you are lucky enough to have a diagnosis from your doctors and say it is not related to the shot, \n\nshow this list to them. \n\nTell them that Pfizer is watching out for those complications. \n\nMany doctors, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants don\u2019t know. \n\nI didn\u2019t until I read the whole list.\n\nMany of the conditions below are rare. \n\nThat means a doctor may not have seen that condition before or might have forgotten about them from medical school. \n\nRare also means there may be no standardized treatment for them.\n\nThe diagnosis on the list does not mean they always happen with the COVID-19 shots, \n\nbut anyone who got \u201cvaccinated\u201d and then diagnosed with the illnesses below should be reported to Pfizer or the VAERS. \n\nThe diagnosis may be months or years after the shots. You can still report them.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also keeping an eye on the AESIs. AESI monitoring determines if there is a higher incidence of specific diseases in people who had the COVID shots. \n\nIf the incidence is higher in people who had the shots, they should stop using these \u201cvaccines\u201d. \n\nThat is if they do their job.\n\nThis list may be from Pfizer, but ALL WHO HAD THE COVID SHOTS WHATEVER THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPORT THEIR DIAGNOSIS.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EASM6EzCVeg", "date_published": "2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
