The Dead Space remake gets new gameplay and a new release window, Call of Duty Warzone is coming to mobile, and Halo Infinite does not work on Steam Deck. 

The Dead Space remake is now targeting an early 2023 release. The remake is being handled by EA Motive, the studio behind Star Wars: Squadrons, and will run on the Frostbite engine.

A new blog post on the official Call of Duty website has confirmed that Call of Duty: Warzone is coming to mobile. There is no word yet on whether or not this will become part of the current Call of Duty Mobile or be available as its own app.

Microsoft has detailed which of its games are compatible with Valve's Steam Deck.  Games like Halo Infinite and The Master Chief Collection are both unsupported, as well as Gears of War 5.

However, GTA V may be showing its age, as we’re finally starting to get our first hints of Grand Theft Auto VI, with Rockstar recently confirming that development on the game is “well underway” and rumors constantly swirling about new characters and the game’s location.
