The Lands Between can be an intimidating place for new players, offering much to do, but little in the way of guidance. Here are ten things you should do in Elden Ring's early game to experience the best of what it has to offer. #EldenRing

The world of Elden Ring is absolutely massive, so there’s a good chance there’s something you might have missed, even if it's small. But the small things add up, and are a part of the experience, so we've put together 10 important things to do in Limgrave, the game's first huge open area.

In the above video, we walk you through how to beat Margit the Fell Omen using a handy item, how to activate Boc the Seamster's questline to alter your outfits, and how to find an early game +8 weapon. We also discuss where to track down other NPCs like Roderika and Blaidd, how to progress their questlines, as well as how to avoid getting caught by those nasty transporter traps. 

Elden Ring launched on February 25th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In our Elden Ring review in progress, Tamoor Hussain gave From Software's latest title a rare GameSpot 10/10, calling it "a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience." Make sure to check out the full Elden Ring review in progress on gamespot.com, or watch the video on youtube.com/gamespot. Keep your eyes peeled for Elden Ring guides and walkthroughs coming your way soon, from which Elden Ring class to pick, to Golden Seed locations, and the best starting route to take in the game.

Sadly, as it never came to be…so would you kindly join us as we go over the failed history of the Bioshock film franchise and what we want to see in Netflix’s upcoming adaptation.

Elden Ring’s latest update improves PS5 and PC stability, playing Destiny 2 on Steam Deck may get you banned, and Apex Legends is now playable on Steam Deck.

Developer From Software has released a small update for the game in the form of patch 1.02.2 for PlayStation 5 and PC, which aims to improve gameplay stability.

Following the launch of Valve's Steam Deck recently, Bungie has clarified that Destiny 2 is not supported on the machine, further stating that anyone trying to bypass approved measures for playing the game will be banned.

A new Twitter video, shared by user Cary Golomb, has demonstrated that the first-person battle royale shooter can now be played on the Steam Deck. The short video shows Apex Legends running quite smoothly while the player runs around looking for loot, but because it's only 15 seconds long, there isn't a chance to see how gunplay reacts to the device, so players will need to test it themselves.
