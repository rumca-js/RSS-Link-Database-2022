But the small things add up, and are a part of the experience, so we've put together 10 important things to do in Limgrave, the game's first huge open area.\n\nIn the above video, we walk you through how to beat Margit the Fell Omen using a handy item, how to activate Boc the Seamster's questline to alter your outfits, and how to find an early game +8 weapon. We also discuss where to track down other NPCs like Roderika and Blaidd, how to progress their questlines, as well as how to avoid getting caught by those nasty transporter traps. \n\nElden Ring launched on February 25th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In our Elden Ring review in progress, Tamoor Hussain gave From Software's latest title a rare GameSpot 10/10, calling it \"a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.\" Make sure to check out the full Elden Ring review in progress on gamespot.com, or watch the video on youtube.com/gamespot.
