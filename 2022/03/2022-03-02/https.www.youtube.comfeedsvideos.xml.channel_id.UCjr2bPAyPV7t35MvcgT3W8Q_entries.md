Russia’s invasion in Ukraine is a self-centered ambition of an authoritarian leader. The defense of Ukraine is an ambition of millions of Ukrainians standing up to a foreign autocrat.  
I don’t see this conflict as just a territorial dispute. I see a young, flawed democracy struggling against an old empire ruled by an autocrat. Ukraine is not perfect. Like Russia, corruption and oligarchy have rotten much of the Ukrainian society. 

But unlike Russians, Ukrainians have been free to choose their own leader that best represents their frustration with the corrupt system. The stark differences between Volodomyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin say a lot about what kind of leaders you can get when you subject them to democratic accountability.

There is a big difference between the kind of a leader Zelenskyy is, and the kind of a leader Putin is. It’s not just their personalities. It’s how they rose to power, how they maintain power, how they treat their opposition, respect civil rights, appeal to their people, and what issues they focus on. So let’s compare.
