vitamin D and increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2,\n\nand poorer clinical outcomes\n\nThis study examines\n\nAny relationship exists between,\n\npre-infection serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level,\n\nWith disease severity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nApril 7th, 2020 and February 4th, 2021\n\nPositive polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2,\n\nsearched for historical 25(OH)D levels measured 14 to 730 days prior\n\nDesign\n\nPatients admitted were categorized,\n\ndisease severity and level of 25(OH)D\n\nDeficient, less than 20 ng/mL (n = 133)\n\nInsufficient, 20 to 30 ng/mL (n = 36)\n\nAdequate, 30 to less than 40 ng/mL (n = 30)\n\nHigh-normal, 40 ng/mL or greater (n = 40)\n\nAccounted for changes throughout the year\n\nResults\n\n1,176 patients admitted\n\n253 had records of a 25(OH)D level prior to infection\n\nA lower vitamin D status was more common in patients with the severe or critical disease\n\nIn patients with severe or critical disease\n\n87.4% had less than 20 ng/mL\n\nIn patients with mild or moderate disease\n\n34.3% had Less than 20 ng/mL\n\nP less than 0.001\n\nPatients with vitamin D deficiency (less than 20 ng/mL) \n\n14 times more likely to have severe or critical disease,\n\nOdds ratio 14 (95% confidence interval 4 to 51) p less than 0.001\n\nMortality, patients with sufficient

deficiency of vitamin D was associated with increased disease severity and mortality.\n\nLow vitamin D status has been associated with a range of autoimmune, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases\n\nEssential immunologic mediator\n\nInhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines, \n\nTNF-alpha and IL-6\n\nEpidemiological risk factors for vitamin D deficiency\n\nDarker skin pigmentation\n\nLow sun exposure\n\nSkin-covering clothes\n\nSun creams\n\nDiet low in fish and dairy products\n\nAn association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and an increased risk of acquiring influenza and respiratory viruses\n\nMeta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, 2007 and 2020\n\nVitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infection as compared with placebos\n\nFactors associated with poorer COVID-19 prognoses\n\nGeographic location in northern countries\n\nOlder age\n\nBlack and minority ethnic groups\n\nObesity\n\nPreexisting conditions, diabetes and hypertension\n\nthese risk factors are also independently associated with vitamin D deficiency\n\nDifficult to ascertain a definitive causative effect of baseline vitamin D status on a clinical presentation during active COVID-19 infection\n\nA cosinor model, to account for the cycles of serum vitamin D values across the seasons\n\nVitamin D levels below less than 20
