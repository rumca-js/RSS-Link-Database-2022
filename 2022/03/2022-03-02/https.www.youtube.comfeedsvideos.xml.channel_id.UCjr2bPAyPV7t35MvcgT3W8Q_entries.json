The defense of Ukraine is an ambition of millions of Ukrainians standing up to a foreign autocrat.  \nI don\u2019t see this conflict as just a territorial dispute. I see a young, flawed democracy struggling against an old empire ruled by an autocrat. Ukraine is not perfect. Like Russia, corruption and oligarchy have rotten much of the Ukrainian society. \n\nBut unlike Russians, Ukrainians have been free to choose their own leader that best represents their frustration with the corrupt system. The stark differences between Volodomyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin say a lot about what kind of leaders you can get when you subject them to democratic accountability.\n\nThere is a big difference between the kind of a leader Zelenskyy is, and the kind of a leader Putin is. It\u2019s not just their personalities. It\u2019s how they rose to power, how they maintain power, how they treat their opposition, respect civil rights, appeal to their people, and what issues they focus on. So let\u2019s compare.\n\nSources\nAttitudes of Ukrainians and Russians toward one another: https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2019/03/11/796144-ukraintsev-k-rossii\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy profile\nhttps://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/ukrayina-ta-estoniya-pogliblyat-spivpracyu-dlya-realizaciyi-55861\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Volodymyr-Zelensky\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky\nhttps://www.businessinsider.nl/who-is-volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-president-central-to-trump-scandal-2019-9?\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/zelensky-ukraine-impeachment/602905/\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-servant-people-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-war-russia/\n\nZelenskiy's path to presidency: https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/7896\n\nZelenskiy's approval rating before invasion: \nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1100076/volodymyr-zelensky-s-approval-rating-ukraine/\nZelenskiy's pre-war behavior: https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220218-military-tactics-zelensky-plays-both-sides-in-ukrainian-crisis \n\nZelenskiy's response to the invasion\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/25/russia-ukraine-president-zelensky-family-target/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-speech.html\nhttps://www.axios.com/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-russia-invasion-248d6e91-d48e-4c05-925f-46b7a0e7bf59.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-russia.html\n\nZelenskiy's Facebok post: https://www.facebook.com/zelenskiy.official/posts/3017309331852756\n\nZelenskiy in Pandora Papers: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/4/pandora-papers-ukraine-leader-seeks-to-justify-offshore-accounts\n\nVladimir Putin profile\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Russia/The-Putin-presidency\nhttps://www.forbes.com/profile/vladimir-putin/\nPutin's life and motivation: https://www.yahoo.com/now/vladimir-putin-president-whose-obsession-180810471.html\n\nPutin's approval ratings: https://www.levada.ru/2021/12/14/obostrenie-v-donbasse/\nhttps://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/\nhttps://www.levada.ru/2022/02/24/ukraina-i-donbass-2/\n\nPutin should fear Zelenskiy: https://carnegiemoscow.org/2019/04/18/putin-should-fear-ukraine-s-russia-friendly-front-runner-pub-78948\n\nPutin's reasoning for invasion: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-president-stays-put-russian-invaders-advance-2022-02-25/\n\nRussians protesting the invasion in Ukraine: https://www.politico.eu/article/protests-detained-russia-ukraine-war/\n\nPutin's approval rating: https://theconversation.com/putins-public-approval-is-soaring-during-the-russia-ukraine-crisis-but-its-unlikely-to-last-177302\n\nPutin in isolation: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine.html\n\nCensorship in Russia: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/technology/russia-censorship-tech.html\nPutin's propaganda and censorship of the Ukraine invasion: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/world/europe/russian-economy-ukraine-war.html\nPutin's desire for Ukraine territory: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/briefing/putin-democracy-ukraine.html\n\n\n\n\nCredits\nMusic by: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSWleZnWJg", "date_published": "2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
