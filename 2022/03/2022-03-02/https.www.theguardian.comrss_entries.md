<p>Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious
consequences, including fines, mass arrests and even imprisonment.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the crackdown, Apollinaria Oleinikova, along
with her husband, Arshak Makichyan, and fellow protester Arina Adju have been attending anti-war rallies in Moscow and St Petersburg since the conflict began. As the death toll continues to rise, they say they
feel like they have no choice but to publicly oppose the Kremlin and stand in solidarity with Ukraine</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/mar/02/ukrainians-are-our-friends-the-young-russian-anti-war-protesters-defying-putin-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 16 years in the construction industry, a chance encounter led Nikki Davison to a career teaching in FE – and she hasn’t looked back</p><p>Nikki Davison never planned to teach in further education (FE). The 39-year-old spent the first 16 years of her career in the construction industry – initially as a quantity surveyor (QS) for a major construction company, then as a QS/estimator for a joinery business.</p><p>It was a chance encounter while still working full-time as a QS/estimator that set her on a new career path. She got chatting to a National Vocational Qualification assessor, who was there to monitor her apprentice; the assessor made FE sound exciting, mentioning that Leeds college of building was recruiting for new teachers. “At first I thought it seemed too daunting – I had no experience and didn’t know where to start – but she sent me a link about the programme and how to apply to become an FE teacher and it went from there.”</p><p>Davison’s industry experience gives her real-world references for her students</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/mar/02/from-construction-to-further-education-meet-the-quantity-surveyor-building-futures">Continue reading...</a>
