I was honored to be a guest on Sean Astin's Zoom Event to celebrate his book club wrapping up The Fellowship of the Ring - and Fable was kind enough to let me share the video here on the channel.  Also featuring Don Marshall and SH from Fable, we talk about our appreciation for JRR Tolkien, finding comfort in Middle-earth, Q&A with Sean.  PLUS Sean and Sarah host a Tolkien Trivia Showdown between me and Don!
