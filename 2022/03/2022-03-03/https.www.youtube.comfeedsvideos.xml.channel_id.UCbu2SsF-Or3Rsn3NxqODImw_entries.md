CD Projekt suspends game sales in Russia, Nintendo releases a Kirby and The Forgotten Lands demo, and Bungie releases Hotfix 4.0.0.2 for Destiny 2.

CD Projekt, the parent company of Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red, has joined global efforts to levy sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The deputy minister of Ukraine has called on Sony and Microsoft to also join in on sanctions, though neither has yet done so. Bloober Team is also suspending sales of its games in Russia/Belarus, as a sign of solidarity for Ukraine.

A new trailer for Kirby and the Forgotten Land has been released today that goes over the game's enemies, the Beast Pack, and the multiple transformations Kirby can use. To help anyone who's still on the fence about picking up the next Kirby game, Nintendo has also released a sizable demo on the Switch's eShop.

In the latest patch update, Bungie is tightening up a number of smaller and more persistent issues in the game, which range from general maintenance to ensuring that players can't abuse an exploit on Savathun's Throne World.

Surprisingly, however the base PS4 version holds up remarkably well for hardware that's nearly a decade old. In this comparison video, we put the two versions side-by-side through numerous races, training sessions, loading times, and more. Our PS5 was captured using "Performance Mode" which focuses on the game's framerate, while the PS4 lacks the option. Gran Turismo 7 March 4th for PlayStation platforms.
