I attempt to build my first PC in 20 years. Last time I built a PC it was a slugfest between Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon, and I went team red way back then.

Let's see if I can put together over $3,000 in parts and build a great PC for gaming and creative workâ€”but more importantly: how fast will it compile the Linux kernel?
