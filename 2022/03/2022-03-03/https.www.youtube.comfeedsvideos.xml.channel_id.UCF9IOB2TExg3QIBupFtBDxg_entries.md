58 % up to 17 years, have antibodies infection

Last data, 72,000 blood samples taken in January

Percentage, United States, resolving or past infection with SARS-CoV-2,

but not how much antibody is present,

do not necessarily indicate the percentage of people with sufficient antibody to protect against reinfection

These percentages do not include people who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and have no history of infection.

that low levels of vitamin D patients do much worse than high levels of vitamin D patients.

Vitamin D deficiency prevalence and cardiovascular risk in Israel

Vit D levels, women, 22.7 ng mL

Vit D levels, men, 23.2 ng mL

(vitamin D levels less than 30 ng mL)

Women, 77·5%,

Men, 79·2%

Only little variation when stratified by age

Prevalence of deficiency in Israel, similar to less sunny regions

Pre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with severity of COVID-19 illness

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220208/vitamin-d-deficiency-tied-to-severe-covid

Potential correlation, low vitamin D and increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2,

and poorer clinical outcomes

This study examines

Any relationship exists between,

pre-infection serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level,

With disease severity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2.

April 7th, 2020 and February 4th, 2021

Positive polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2,

searched for historical 25(OH)D levels measured 14 to 730 days prior

Design

Patients admitted were categorized,

disease severity and level of 25(OH)D

Deficient, less than 20 ng/mL (n = 133)

Insufficient, 20 to 30 ng/mL (n = 36)

Adequate, 30 to less than 40 ng/mL (n = 30)

High-normal, 40 ng/mL or greater (n = 40)

Accounted for changes throughout the year

Results

1,176 patients admitted

253 had records of a 25(OH)D level prior to infection

A lower vitamin D status was more common in patients with the severe or critical disease

In patients with severe or critical disease

87.4% had less than 20 ng/mL

In patients with mild or moderate disease

34.3% had Less than 20 ng/mL

P less than 0.001

Patients with vitamin D deficiency (less than 20 ng/mL) 

14 times more likely to have severe or critical disease,

Odds ratio 14 (95% confidence interval 4 to 51) p less than 0.001

Mortality, patients with sufficient vitamin D levels

2.3%

Mortality, patients with deficient vitamin D levels

25.6% mortality rate (p less than 0.001)

Conclusions

Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D was associated with increased disease severity and mortality.

Low vitamin D status has been associated with a range of autoimmune, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases

Essential immunologic mediator

Inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines, 

TNF-alpha and IL-6

Epidemiological risk factors for vitamin D deficiency

Darker skin pigmentation

Low sun exposure

Skin-covering clothes

Sun creams

Diet low in fish and dairy products

An association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and an increased risk of acquiring influenza and respiratory viruses

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, 2007 and 2020

Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infection as compared with placebos

Factors associated with poorer COVID-19 prognoses

Geographic location in northern countries

Older age

Black and minority ethnic groups

Obesity

Preexisting conditions, diabetes and hypertension

these risk factors are also independently associated with vitamin D deficiency

Difficult to ascertain a definitive causative effect of baseline vitamin D status on a clinical presentation during active COVID-19 infection

A cosinor model, to account for the cycles of serum vitamin D values across the seasons

Vitamin D levels below less than 20 ng/mL

Israeli Arabs 64.3%

Israeli non-Arabs 35.7%
