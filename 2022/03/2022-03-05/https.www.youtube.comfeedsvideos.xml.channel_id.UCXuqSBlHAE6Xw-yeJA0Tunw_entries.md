The Xbox Series S has always been tiny and mighty, yet it exists in the shadow of Microsoft's preferred, fridge-shaped, Series X. Now this game console has a trick up its sleeve. It's called the xScreen, an attachable gaming display, that makes the console much more mobile. But is this monitor worth your money?
