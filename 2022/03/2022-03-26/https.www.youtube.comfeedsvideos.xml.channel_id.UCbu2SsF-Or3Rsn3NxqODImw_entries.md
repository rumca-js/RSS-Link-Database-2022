Few games have promised and then delivered as much mayhem as Borderlands, the loot ‘em up from Gearbox Software. With the release of its spin-off, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, we decided it was time to take a look back, so here’s the History of Borderlands.

Since 2009, Gearbox Software's Borderlands series has been full to the brim with explosions, quirky characters, mountains of loot, and of course, hundreds of thousands of guns to collect. With the release of the latest spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, we thought it was a perfect time to look back on how Borderlands was made, and the impact the series has had on the world of gaming.

Borderlands launched shoulder to shoulder with juggernauts like Uncharted 2, Halo 3: ODST, and Modern Warfare 2 in 2009, but was a surprise hit, meaning that sequels and spin-offs, and pre-sequels weren't far behind. Borderlands was a juggernaut, with players loving its humor, gameplay, as well as mixing and matching the abilities of the playable Vault Hunters. From Handsome Jack to series mascot Claptrap, there's been no shortage of quotable and lovable Borderlands characters. The series also experimented with Tales from the Borderlands, a narrative adventure game made by Telltale Games in collaboration with Gearbox.

In our Tiny Tina's Wonderlands review, Darryn Bonthyus gave the game 7/10, saying that the game is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but struggles to find its own identity. For more on Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, make sure you subscribe to GameSpot.

## Which Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Class Is Right For You?

There are six starting character classes in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, and whether you want to be a hammer swinging fire god or a badass dual wielding gun wizard, or you just can’t decide what you want to be, we have you covered.

00:14 - Spore Warden
03:23 - Spellshot
06:36 - Brr-Zerker
11:06 - Clawbringer
15:01 - Graveborn
21:30 - Stabbomancer

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands departs from the core Borderlands series and allows you to make your own character. Instead of a vault hunter, you’ll play as a highly customizable Fatemaker. When it comes to how you’ll fight, you get to choose one of six starting classes: Brr-Zerker, Clawbringer, Graveborn, Spellshot, Spore Warde, or Stabbomancer. Later in the game, you can multiclass and build your hero using a second skill tree from another class. That means you’ll be able to come up with some pretty wild and powerful builds with the ability to do things like bring multiple pets with you into battle.

It can be pretty daunting trying to decide on a starting class, so in this video, we’re going to give you a rundown of each and to help you figure out which one is right for you. There are easy solo classes like the Stabbomancer, which focuses on critical damage and can go invisible to escape bad situations. There are team-player classes like the Clawbringer, which can buff the party with fire damage while running around smashing things with a hammer. For original Borderlands fans who love Salvador the Gunzerker, you have something similar in the Spellshot, which can dual-wield magic. Druid/ranger types will love the ranged class Spore Warden. Glass cannon types will appreciate the Graveborn, and Krieg fans will enjoy running into and smashing things with the Brr-Zerker. 

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands releases on March 25 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you need to purchase the more expensive editions of the game for new-gen optimizations. Its first post-launch content season begins starting April 21 and developer Gearbox has said it'll add a seventh class at a later point.
