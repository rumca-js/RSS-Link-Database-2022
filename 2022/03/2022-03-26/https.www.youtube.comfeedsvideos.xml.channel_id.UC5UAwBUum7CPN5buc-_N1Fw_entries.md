GNOME can be transformed entirely thanks to extensions. The easiest way to get to these is to install the app called "Extension manager". If you don't want an app to do that, you can also just head over to extensions.gnome.org and look at them this way.

One of the most widely seen is dash to panel. It's perfect if you want to replicate a familiar windows-like, or KDE-like layout. It's also super customizable itself, with options like changing the position of the panel itself. It can also be combined with other extensions, like different menus, or the all important AppIndicator extension.

It does what it says: it just lets you add support back for these nasty looking icons in your top bar. 

Don't like a bottom bar? Why not get a dock, always visible? Dash to dock does just that.

You'll get the "Activities" dock from GNOME, but always visible on the bottom, with running app indicators, launchers, separated from apps you haven't pinned, and even a trashcan, the plugged in storage devices, and the applications menu. 

You can also switch to dark or light mode automatically,, thanks to Night Theme switcher. It will simply switch your desktop to dark mode depending on the time of day, or on a manual schedule. 

If you're more into eye candy and a nostalgic of the COmpiz days, you also have the burn my windows extension.

It lets you pick various animations for opening or closing your applications, and even apply them to dialogs. Ranging from actually making your windows catch fire and disappear, to being shredded by claws. If you can't decide, you can pick multiple effects, and have them randomized, and each effect can be tweaked in terms of duration and scale.

What about these desktop icons? For that, why not use Deskop Icons NG? It basically rehabilitates your desktop as an icon and files folder, so you can finally hide that wonderful wallpaper with all sorts of crap you'll never sort through or remember is there.

For fans of eye candy, there's also a nice option, called blur my shell. It will add some nice blur on the background of the activities view, based on your wallpaper. Your search view, activities view, or apps list will definitely look snazzier with this one.

Of course, you might also want to change the look of your GNOME applications. All you need to do is install GNOME Tweaks, and then look for a theme you like. For that, GNOME Look is your friend. 

Once you've downloaded a theme, all you have to do is extract it, and place the resultant folder inside one of 2 directories. Themes go into the .themes folder in your user directory, and icons in the .icons directory.

These are hidden folders, and you might need to create them. Don't forget the "." at the beginning of the name. Showing or hiding hidden folders in Nautilus can be done with the press of COntrol + H.

Once your themes are placed there, open GNOME Tweaks, hit the appearance tab, and choose the theme you want!

Cursors work in the same way, and can be placed in the .icons folder as well.
