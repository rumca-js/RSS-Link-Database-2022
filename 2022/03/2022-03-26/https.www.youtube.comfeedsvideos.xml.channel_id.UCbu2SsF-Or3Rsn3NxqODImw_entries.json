With the release of its spin-off, Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands, we decided it was time to take a look back, so here\u2019s the History of Borderlands.\n\nSince 2009, Gearbox Software's Borderlands series has been full to the brim with explosions, quirky characters, mountains of loot, and of course, hundreds of thousands of guns to collect. With the release of the latest spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, we thought it was a perfect time to look back on how Borderlands was made, and the impact the series has had on the world of gaming.\n\nBorderlands launched shoulder to shoulder with juggernauts like Uncharted 2, Halo 3: ODST, and Modern Warfare 2 in 2009, but was a surprise hit, meaning that sequels and spin-offs, and pre-sequels weren't far behind. Borderlands was a juggernaut, with players loving its humor, gameplay, as well as mixing and matching the abilities of the playable Vault Hunters. From Handsome Jack to series mascot Claptrap, there's been no shortage of quotable and lovable Borderlands characters. The series also experimented with Tales from the Borderlands, a narrative adventure game made by Telltale Games in collaboration with Gearbox.\n\nIn our Tiny Tina's Wonderlands review, Darryn Bonthyus gave the game 7/10, saying that the game is an easily digestible adventure with fantasy flavor, but struggles to find its own identity.

While the Forgotten Land is still fairly straightforward, there are some tricks of the trade we picked up throughout our time with the game. We've rounded up 10 tips and tricks for Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

Instead of a vault hunter, you\u2019ll play as a highly customizable Fatemaker. When it comes to how you\u2019ll fight, you get to choose one of six starting classes: Brr-Zerker, Clawbringer, Graveborn, Spellshot, Spore Warde, or Stabbomancer. Later in the game, you can multiclass and build your hero using a second skill tree from another class. That means you\u2019ll be able to come up with some pretty wild and powerful builds with the ability to do things like bring multiple pets with you into battle.\n\nIt can be pretty daunting trying to decide on a starting class, so in this video, we\u2019re going to give you a rundown of each and to help you figure out which one is right for you. There are easy solo classes like the Stabbomancer, which focuses on critical damage and can go invisible to escape bad situations. There are team-player classes like the Clawbringer, which can buff the party with fire damage while running around smashing things with a hammer. For original Borderlands fans who love Salvador the Gunzerker, you have something similar in the Spellshot, which can dual-wield magic. Druid/ranger types will love the ranged class Spore Warden. Glass cannon types will appreciate the Graveborn, and Krieg fans will enjoy running into and smashing things with the Brr-Zerker.\u00a0\n\nTiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands releases on March 25 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you need to purchase the more expensive editions of the game for new-gen optimizations. Its first post-launch content season begins starting April 21 and developer Gearbox has said it'll add a seventh class at a later point.\n\n#tinytinaswonderlands", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGyX-93W_Zg", "date_published": "2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
