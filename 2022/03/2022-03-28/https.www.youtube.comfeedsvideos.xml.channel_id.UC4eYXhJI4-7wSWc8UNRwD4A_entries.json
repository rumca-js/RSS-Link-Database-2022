Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | March 28, 2022\nFitting many people into a small space has been key to the Tiny Desk formula since its  beginning, so it only makes sense that Madi Diaz would perpetuate the tradition as she presides over a \u201ctiny living room\u201d concert in her Nashville, Tenn. home. \u201cNever have there been so many people in this apartment,\u201d she notes between songs.\n\nDiaz\u2019s living room may not have been designed to accommodate a four-piece string section and a drummer, but together these six musicians make beautiful work of four tracks from the singer-songwriter\u2019s stunning 2021 sleeper History of a Feeling. Opening with \u201cResentment\u201d \u2014 a song she\u2019d originally co-written for Kesha\u2019s 2020 album High Road \u2014 Diaz steers her four-song set toward History of a Feeling\u2019s quieter moments, in the process coaxing new power from career highlights like \u201cNew Person, Old Place.\u201d\n\nOne of the strongest and subtlest breakup albums in recent memory, History of a Feeling works through a broad range of emotions with clear-eyed attention to detail and a willingness from Diaz to examine her own missteps and darkest impulses. So it only makes sense that in this performance, Diaz would give this material restrained arrangements to match \u2014 knowing full well that the songs\u2019 beauty and quietly bold truth-telling would shine through. Her work has rarely sounded richer or more radiant than it does here.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cResentment\u201d\n\u201cNew Person, Old Place\u201d\n\u201cForever\u201d\n\u201cHistory of a Feeling\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nMadi Diaz: vocals, guitar\nAdam Popick: drums\nAnnaliese Kowert, Kristin Weber: violin\nLydia Luce: viola\nKaitlyn Raitz: cello\n\nCREDITS\nDirected and Edited by: Jordan Bellamy \nTracking and Mixing: Konrad Snyder\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #madidiaz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT8nSsHrUf0", "date_published": "2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
