Drawing on firsthand accounts from exiled Russian business tycoons, writers and politicians, as well as the exhaustive research of scholar and best-selling \u201cPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy\u201d author Karen Dawisha, the film examined troubling episodes in Putin\u2019s past, from alleged money-laundering activities and ties to organized crime, to a secret personal fortune said to be in the billions.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
