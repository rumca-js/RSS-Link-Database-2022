Here are ten things you should do in Elden Ring's early game to experience the best of what it has to offer. #EldenRing\n\nThe world of Elden Ring is absolutely massive, so there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s something you might have missed, even if it's small. But the small things add up, and are a part of the experience, so we've put together 10 important things to do in Limgrave, the game's first huge open area.\n\nIn the above video, we walk you through how to beat Margit the Fell Omen using a handy item, how to activate Boc the Seamster's questline to alter your outfits, and how to find an early game +8 weapon. We also discuss where to track down other NPCs like Roderika and Blaidd, how to progress their questlines, as well as how to avoid getting caught by those nasty transporter traps. \n\nElden Ring launched on February 25th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In our Elden Ring review in progress, Tamoor Hussain gave From Software's latest title a rare GameSpot 10/10, calling it \"a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience.\" Make sure to check out the full Elden Ring review in progress on gamespot.com, or watch the video on youtube.com/gamespot.

With new gameplay mechanics like the Deepsight Resonance and battling the new Hive sect known as the Lucent Brood. Destiny is triumphantly showing all the things Bungie has learned from its past releases.\n\nWe've\u00a0 got plenty more coverage for Destiny 2 on GameSpot.com.
