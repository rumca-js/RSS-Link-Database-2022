The Lands Between can be an intimidating place for new players, offering much to do, but little in the way of guidance. Here are ten things you should do in Elden Ring's early game to experience the best of what it has to offer. #EldenRing

The world of Elden Ring is absolutely massive, so there’s a good chance there’s something you might have missed, even if it's small. But the small things add up, and are a part of the experience, so we've put together 10 important things to do in Limgrave, the game's first huge open area.

In the above video, we walk you through how to beat Margit the Fell Omen using a handy item, how to activate Boc the Seamster's questline to alter your outfits, and how to find an early game +8 weapon. We also discuss where to track down other NPCs like Roderika and Blaidd, how to progress their questlines, as well as how to avoid getting caught by those nasty transporter traps. 

Elden Ring launched on February 25th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In our Elden Ring review in progress, Tamoor Hussain gave From Software's latest title a rare GameSpot 10/10, calling it "a masterpiece of open-world design that places exploration and player agency at the heart of the experience." Make sure to check out the full Elden Ring review in progress on gamespot.com, or watch the video on youtube.com/gamespot. Keep your eyes peeled for Elden Ring guides and walkthroughs coming your way soon, from which Elden Ring class to pick, to Golden Seed locations, and the best starting route to take in the game.

Elden Ring’s latest update improves PS5 and PC stability, playing Destiny 2 on Steam Deck may get you banned, and Apex Legends is now playable on Steam Deck.

Developer From Software has released a small update for the game in the form of patch 1.02.2 for PlayStation 5 and PC, which aims to improve gameplay stability.

Following the launch of Valve's Steam Deck recently, Bungie has clarified that Destiny 2 is not supported on the machine, further stating that anyone trying to bypass approved measures for playing the game will be banned.

A new Twitter video, shared by user Cary Golomb, has demonstrated that the first-person battle royale shooter can now be played on the Steam Deck. The short video shows Apex Legends running quite smoothly while the player runs around looking for loot, but because it's only 15 seconds long, there isn't a chance to see how gunplay reacts to the device, so players will need to test it themselves.

Elden Ring is dominating Steam’s best seller list, Steam could team up with Game Pass, and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are announced. 

The list of best-selling games on Steam for the past week has been revealed, and unsurprisingly, From Software's massively anticipated Elden Ring topped the charts, while Destiny 2's Witch Queen expansion also performed well.

Speaking to PC Gamer, Newell said Valve is unlikely to create a similar service of its own, but working with Microsoft to add Game Pass to Steam might be something Valve would consider.

The Pokémon Company has announced the next generation of Pokémon games, Scarlet and Violet, and both are coming to Nintendo Switch later this year.

Elden Ring director comments on the game’s difficulty, Elden Ring PC mod lets you pause the game, and Xbox Game Pass for March includes Guardians Of The Galaxy.    

From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki, Elden Ring’s director, has weighed in on the discussion surrounding the game's difficulty. Speaking to The New Yorker, Miyazaki said he feels apologetic to those who are hesitant to play From Software's games due to their difficulty. 

Modder TechieW's fix is easy to install and use in the PC version of Elden Ring, but you'll need to disable Easy Anti-Cheat to make it run smoothly.

For the first time we have a complete, and exceptional campaign in Destiny 2. It's latest expansion, The Witch Queen, takes all of the best lessons learned from past Destiny games and offers a campaign that rivals those of Bungie's classic Halo games. Here's why.

Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is live and numerous Guardians are eagerly flying into Savathun's Throne World right now. The expansion offers a huge glut of content, including a brand-new story campaign with a Legendary difficulty level, and a rework of what we've come to expect from Destiny 2 campaign missions.

In this video, David shares his opinion on how The Witch Queen has been one of, if not the, best campaigns in Destiny's history with strong callbacks to the heyday of Halo or even Doom. With new gameplay mechanics like the Deepsight Resonance and battling the new Hive sect known as the Lucent Brood. Destiny is triumphantly showing all the things Bungie has learned from its past releases.

We've  got plenty more coverage for Destiny 2 on GameSpot.com. Be sure to stay tuned for our Destiny 2: The Witch Queen review by Phil Hornshaw. If you're hungry for more Destiny content, we'll have links at the end of this video to some of our other breakdowns.
