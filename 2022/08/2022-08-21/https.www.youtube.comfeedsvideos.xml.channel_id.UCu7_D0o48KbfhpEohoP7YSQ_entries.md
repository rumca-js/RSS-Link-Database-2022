Computers crash if they do not have enough voltage. Li-Ion batteries could explode during charging if they were deeply discharged. How can we prevent such events? We need so-called voltage supervisors. Cheap parts with a big effect, which usually do their job in the dark. Letâ€™s tear them to the light and protect your ESP32 or Arduino from not booting correctly and your Raspberry from a crash. We will use KA75330, KA75450, and TPS3839 for our experiments.
