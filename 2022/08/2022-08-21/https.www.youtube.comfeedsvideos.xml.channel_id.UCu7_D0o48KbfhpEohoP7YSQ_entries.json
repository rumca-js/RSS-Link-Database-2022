Li-Ion batteries could explode during charging if they were deeply discharged. How can we prevent such events? We need so-called voltage supervisors. Cheap parts with a big effect, which usually do their job in the dark. Let\u2019s tear them to the light and protect your ESP32 or Arduino from not booting correctly and your Raspberry from a crash. We will use KA75330, KA75450, and TPS3839 for our experiments.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nRaspberry Pi4 US: https://amzn.to/3pP32HZ \nRaspberry Pi4 DE: https://amzn.to/3avMgaG\nKA75330: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFh3FAT\nKA75450: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmK5e7p\nTPS3839G33: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlUdImr\nPower Supply: https://amzn.to/3PykooI or http://bit.ly/2uG5mJR or https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeoZqEn\nESP32 Breadboard friendly: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkWIMfD\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (no additional cost for you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGithub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
