The mod originally got a full release under the name NaturalVision Remastered, but development has continued under the moniker NaturalVision Evolved. In a new trailer, the team behind it shows off their work and outlines recent additions to the mod. This latest update adds parallax roads, pavement, and building interiors, giving the ground more layered textures and granting inaccessible interiors the illusion of depth. A wider variety of vegetation and volumetric clouds lend additional fidelity to the game's natural landscapes. The mod has yet to have a full release, but is in early access beta and you can download it for free on the Razed Mods website.\u00a0\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2022 Pokemon World Championships in London, The Pokemon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara unveiled a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which focused on battle mechanics and online play. The trailer opened with the introduction of a new Pokemon, the Dragon- and Normal-type Cyclizar, which showed off a new move called Shed Tail.\u00a0\n\nAfter a 2021 event that saw the highest streaming numbers in its history, Geoff Keighley will present the 2022 Game Awards on December 8 live from Los Angeles.

The video was met with roaring excitement.\n\nFor fans, the chance to delve into a new world developed by Arkane Lyon was exciting. Internally, however, Deathloop wasn't garnering the same enthusiasm, with a lot of early playtesters not understanding what the game even was.\n\nDana Nightingale, Deathloop's campaign director, tells the story of the redesign that saved the game from near disaster. Early user research had criticized the game for its obtuse and esoteric design, with some players confusing it for a different genre entirely. Much like the premise of the game, Dana had to approach the game's design from many different angles over and over again, until piecing together something coherent for early playtesters to understand only weeks before its official release date.\u00a0\n\nThis is the story of the redesign that saved Deathloop.\n\n#gaming #deathloop #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uzhjl8xh_M", "date_published": "2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "10 Things You Didn't Know About Saints Row", "description": "Although the Saints Row games throw secrets and easter eggs your way at breakneck speed, here are some things you might now know about the bombastic series. \n\nStu here to unravel the mysteries and zany references throughout the Saints Row games. From Arc Numbers to Fight Club, Saints Row is a series that revels in featuring the pop culture references and memes from the zeitgeist of the eras that they came out in. Some of these secrets occur as easter eggs within the games themselves, and some can be found within the development of the series as a whole. I'm excited to see how the series expands on its history of debauchery in the upcoming Saints Row reboot. Saints Row is Available on Playstation, Xbox, and PC.
