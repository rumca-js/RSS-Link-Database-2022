Jurassic World Dominion is the latest entry in the Jurassic Park reboot franchise, which has some good stuff in it and made a bunch of money as per usual. But despite all the positives, the movie also harms itself with a second, very unentertaining plotline in addition to the Chris Pratt one that ultimately drags the entire experience down to the swamps. And so in today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's compare the two main plotlines of the movie to see why one of them doesn't work at all. Here's when you should cut your losses and focus on what actually works in your movie.

This summer, experience the epic conclusion to the Jurassic era as two generations unite for the first time. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are joined by Oscar®-winner Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill in Jurassic World Dominion, a bold, timely and breathtaking new adventure that spans the globe. From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live—and hunt—alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history’s most fearsome creatures. The film features new cast members DeWanda Wise (She’s Gotta Have It), Emmy nominee Mamoudou Athie (Archive 81), Dichen Lachman (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Scott Haze (Minari) and Campbell Scott (The Amazing Spider-Man 2).
