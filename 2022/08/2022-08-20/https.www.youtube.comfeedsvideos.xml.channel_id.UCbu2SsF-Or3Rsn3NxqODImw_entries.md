Although the Saints Row games throw secrets and easter eggs your way at breakneck speed, here are some things you might now know about the bombastic series. 

Stu here to unravel the mysteries and zany references throughout the Saints Row games. From Arc Numbers to Fight Club, Saints Row is a series that revels in featuring the pop culture references and memes from the zeitgeist of the eras that they came out in. Some of these secrets occur as easter eggs within the games themselves, and some can be found within the development of the series as a whole. I'm excited to see how the series expands on its history of debauchery in the upcoming Saints Row reboot. Saints Row is Available on Playstation, Xbox, and PC. Saints Row The Third remastered is available on Playstation, Xbox, PC, and Switch.
