Anyone on that platform that preorders the game, received a beta code during the world championship event, or receives them via online giveaways from Activision or partnered streamers, will have access at this time. On the 18th through the 20th of September, the beta becomes open to all PlayStation players.\n\nGamers on Xbox and PC can jump into their own early access period on September 22nd and 23rd, with the beta becoming available to all players on every platform September 24th through 26th. That means if you\u2019re playing in early access on PlayStation, you have a full ten days of beta to sink your teeth into.\n\nNo modes were confirmed for the beta, but a new map, Marina Grand Prix, which looks to take place on a Formula 1 race track, was shown off and will be playable in September. We\u2019re also hoping to see if Battle Maps will make an appearance which are COD MW 2\u2019s larger scale modes including Ground War. \n\nBut that\u2019s not all! Right before the beta kicks off, on September 15th, a Call of Duty Next event will take place. This will be when you will get your first real look at Modern Warfare 2\u2019s multiplayer, Activision\u2019s next iteration of Warzone, as well as a taste of Warzone for mobile. Yes, Call of Duty currently has a very popular mobile title, that does already include a battle royale mode, but it is something more akin to the BR that was packed in with Black Ops 4 Blackout than the much more popular, stand alone Warzone. \n\nOk, was that enough Call of Duty for you? I think that was enough Call of Duty for you. How about some Tekken?\n\nTIME CODES: \n00:09 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:54 - Tekken\n02:57 - Splatoon 3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObJuAgsHz9M", "date_published": "2022-08-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Tekken Official Teaser Announcement", "description": "A teaser for the next game in the beloved Tekken series dropped at EVO 2022.

We know there's something out there for all skill levels and budgets. If you are a veteran player or just want to try your hand at more slow-paced, methodical, and brain-taxing shooter games, this video is for you. We're about to show you games with great mechanics, levels, and unique ideas around close-quarter combat.\u00a0\n\nWe'll start with an easy first pick: Void Interactive's Ready Or Not, a team-based tactical shooter with very mature themes. This title nails many of the fundamentals of SWAT-style games, including a great communications system, large toolset, constant sense of danger, and incredibly satisfying door-breaching. This game is also very contemporary, which might be tough for some people, so use your own judgment. Then we'll explore a level from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare by Infinity Ward that drastically differed from every other Call of Duty game and put players in some intense shoot-or-don't-shoot scenarios. We'll then move on to a few wildcard picks, the first being Superhot, which allows players the time to think through fast-moving gunfights and feel like Neo from The Matrix. We'll then keep picking titles based on unique ideas, such as the wicked sound design of Insurgency Sandstorm, the meticulously modeled guns and one-handed gun manipulation from Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, and the perma-death seen in the turn-based XCOM series, and entry-level budget picks on Steam like Zero Hour and Ground Branch. Finally, we can't forget the long-running close-quarters PvP tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege, which is going into Year 7.\n\u00a0\nWe hope we found something for everyone on every platform, including PlayStation 5, PSVR, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and those with more complex virtual reality setups. We had to cut a number of other unique titles off this list, so let us know if you want a second part that covers retro games like the older Rainbow Six titles and lesser-known titles like Syndicate.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 Ready Or Not\n2:55 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)\n4:00 - SUPERHOT\n4:50 - Insurgency: Sandstorm\n5:39 - Hotdogs, Horseshoes, & Hand Grenades\n7:00 - Zero Hour & Ground Branch\n8:31 - XCOM\n9:46 - Rainbow Six Siege\n\n\n\n#gamespot #gaming #readyornot #h3vr #rainbowsixsiege", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sljwb-Lb0vI", "date_published": "2022-08-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
