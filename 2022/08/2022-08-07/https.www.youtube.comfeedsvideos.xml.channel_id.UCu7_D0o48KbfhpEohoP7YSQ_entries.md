“Which transistor will work with my project?” Mouser alone lists different 37000 types. We will reduce this number to a “survival kit” for our lab. To do that, we give a little background and do some experiments.
In this video we will:
- Focus on Arduino and ESP projects
- Look at the technology behind the transistors to distinguish the needed from the “nice-to-have”
- Do some tests in typical applications
- And finally, provide rules of thumb and a “survival kit” for your lab
