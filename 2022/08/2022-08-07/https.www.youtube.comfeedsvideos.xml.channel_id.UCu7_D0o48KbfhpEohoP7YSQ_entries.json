We will reduce this number to a \u201csurvival kit\u201d for our lab. To do that, we give a little background and do some experiments.\nIn this video we will:\n- Focus on Arduino and ESP projects\n- Look at the technology behind the transistors to distinguish the needed from the \u201cnice-to-have\u201d\n- Do some tests in typical applications\n- And finally, provide rules of thumb and a \u201csurvival kit\u201d for your lab \n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwyP4Yd0-O49e05kMUJgQQ\n\nLinks:\nN-Channel: \nIRF3708 (TO-220) https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCdJWBV\nSi2302DS (SMD) http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_s7Z334\n\nP-Channel:\nNDP6020P (TO-220) http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_rvulr8\nSi2301 (SMD) http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_sAd55C\n\nTransistor Curve Tracer: https://amzn.to/3biWrUl or https://ebay.us/7BHfW2\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (no additional cost for you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGithub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
