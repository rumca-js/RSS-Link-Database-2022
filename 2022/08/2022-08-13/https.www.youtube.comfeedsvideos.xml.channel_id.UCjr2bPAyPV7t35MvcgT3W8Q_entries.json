If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.\n\nAnonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. \n\nThe Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. \n\nOur first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.\n\nDissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts. \n\nPRIVACY THREAT MODELING\nhttps://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \nLINDDUN strategy for threat modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/post/keys-to-successful-privacy-threat-modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linddun \nhttps://www.linddun.org/_files/ugd/cc602e_cf7e4c6b1d894bdaabc3094c48b26869.pdf \nhttps://www.linddun.org/go-getting-started \nLinkability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linkability \nIdentifiability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/identifiability-1 \nMitigation strategies\nhttps://www.linddun.org/mitigation-strategies-and-solutions \n\nRECOMMENDED TOOLS\nKeepassXC\nhttps://keepassxc.org/ \nBitwarden\nhttps://bitwarden.com/ \nFIDO security keys\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/ \nGrapheneOS\nhttps://grapheneos.org/\nOrbot\nhttps://orbot.app/ \nTor Browser\nhttps://www.torproject.org/ \nTutanota\nhttps://tutanota.com/ \nProtonMail\nhttps://proton.me/ \nBriar\nhttps://briarproject.org/\nOnionShare\nhttps://onionshare.org/\nWire\nhttps://wire.com/en/\nMatrix/Element\nhttps://element.io/\nHow to anonymously install applications\nhttps://www.privacyguides.org/android/#obtaining-applications \nAurora Open Source Software\nhttps://auroraoss.com/\nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Intercept\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4gqRYkA9KE \nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Hated One\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJH-UJyENs\n\nNEWS SOURCES\nGoogle location tracking\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/states-file-new-suits-against-google-over-location-tracking-11643037890 \nChainalysis\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/chainalysis-estimates-2b-stolen-from-cross-chain-bridge-hacks-this-year/ \n\nCredits\nMusic by: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QsQp7DyjE", "date_published": "2022-08-13 15:12:14+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "anonymity"]}]
