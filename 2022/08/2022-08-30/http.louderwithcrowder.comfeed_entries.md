There are many instances in which I hang my head and think, "I'm ashamed to have served in the military." I never thought I'd think such a thing, but then I never thought I would see this country take the turns it's presently taking. When the army is training its soldiers in the ways of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/army-issues-mandatory-gender-training" target="_blank">gender ideology</a>, I'm ashamed. And when the air force is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/specops-lowered-standards-female-quit" target="_blank">allowing substandard airmen to be "helped" through training</a> because it happens to be a female, I'm ashamed. And when the Navy turns to "esports" to recruit "warfighters," I'm ashamed...<br /></p><p>And that's exactly what they're doing! From <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2022/08/30/navy-calls-on-gamers-to-join-its-esports-team/" target="_blank">Military Times</a>, due to poor recruiting numbers, "Navy officials are hoping its esports team — Goats and Glory, a part of the service’s recruiting command — will be one small part of a solution to attract a younger audience."</p><p><em>"Selected sailors will receive three-year orders to the team’s facility in Memphis, Tennessee. [...] the team practices, livestreams and competes in online games, from 'League of Legends' to 'Call of Duty.'"</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>If I didn't know that the US military has become a joke, a terrible punchline, a shell of what it once was, I wouldn't believe this crap. But it has become just that. Where I used to finish work and go home to wreck n00bs in hardcore team deathmatch to unwind, there will be sailors doing this for a living on the taxpayer's dime. But hey, at least these new recruits <em>might</em> help bring in new recruits because, as the team's captain Lt. Aaron Jones says, "One of the group's toughest tasks [...] is attracting new talent."</p><p>But I can't just sh*t on the navy for this idiocy. The <a href="https://airforcegaming.com/" target="_blank">air force</a> and <a href="https://recruiting.army.mil/army_esports/" target="_blank">army </a>both have their own esports organizations, too! So, the American taxpayer is subsidizing a bunch of soft, genderqueer, overly sensitive gamers under the guise of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/army-woke-ad-emma-cringe" target="_blank">recruiting </a>and "as a means of gaining valuable skills that can be applied to making warfighters."</p><p>Does everyone feel confident in our ability to win the next major armed conflict? I have warm and fuzzies about it, guys! I have no doubt some kid who goes by they/them pronouns and manages a whopping 7 killstreak while camping in a corner with a shotgun will be more than capable of gutting commies on the battlefield... God, help us all!</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Internet cringes for 'Mark,' some poor schlub who got friend-zoned to death on a baseball jumbotron

Technically, the murder took place at a Milwaukee Brewers game. But Twitter didn't help matters. Our dearly departed's name is Mark. No one is quite sure who Mark is. What we do know is that Mark got friend-zoned to death for everyone to see, point at, and laugh.</p><p>You know how when you go to a ball game, you can send messages to your loved ones? "Happy Retirement," "I love you," "The test came back negative," and so on. Some--I'll be old-fashioned and assume it's a woman--used the opportunity to broadcast, <em>"Mark - Your friendship means the world to me - <strong>let's not wreck it</strong>."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Everyone say a prayer for Mark <a href="https://twitter.com/BarstoolBigCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BarstoolBigCat</a> <a href="https://t.co/JYj9xp1ufn">pic.twitter.com/JYj9xp1ufn</a><br />— Alf (@Alfaveli) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alfaveli/status/1564441426166956033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <a href="https://t.co/fJv7iBIMCk">pic.twitter.com/fJv7iBIMCk</a><br />— The Black Wolf (@SC_IronWolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/SC_IronWolf/status/1564551574525034497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>For those who don't know a) you're lying, and b) the friend zone is when a guy chases after a girl, may or may not get led on (usually is led on), and eventually gets told she only likes him as a friend. It rarely happens the other way because if a girl likes a guy, he'll usually at least just enjoy the texts of chesticle pictures. But being in the friend zone is brutal when you are in school. Or so I heard.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Same dude.<br />— Justine Bautista (@EASY8for3) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASY8for3/status/1564619626905972736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joeziz59/status/1564446441921200128" target="_blank">An eyewitness to the murder</a> describes the scene as tough. There was a collective gasp from the audience. Then laughter, except for one man who was crying. It is unclear if that dude was Mark, or if Mark was in attendance. I can't decide what would be worse: being in attendance, or not being at the game and finding out on Twitter, or walking the hallway while everyone was snickering at me more than usual.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Mark rn <a href="https://t.co/ni7aHYk9Xd">pic.twitter.com/ni7aHYk9Xd</a><br />— N00NAN (@morniNOONANite) <a href="https://twitter.com/morniNOONANite/status/1564449121515233281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Mark minding his own business, sitting next to Sarah reading the messages on the big board <a href="https://t.co/Mx6CoJvS1R">pic.twitter.com/Mx6CoJvS1R</a><br />— Ryan 🇺🇦 (@ThatOhioKidRyan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatOhioKidRyan/status/1564594042851266562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The question on all our minds now is who the bigger bitch is. Unrequited love is no excuse for a public execution like this. The girl could have sent him a text message or slipped a note into his locker. She could have gotten a friend to do it. Going right to the jumbotron to broadcast to the world you think Mark is a chud but you like the attention he gives you is cruel and unusual.</p><p>The flip side to that is that Mark refuses to get the hint after multiple attempts. Public embarrassment was the final straw.</p><p>Sound off in the comment section of whatever social app brought you here. Are you team Mark or team Executioner?</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

And that's not just the "crimes" being committed against taxpayers by our elected officials. I'm talking <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/january-6th-trump" target="_blank">violent crime</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dc-puppy-thieves-not-charged" target="_blank">out in the streets</a>, as is par for the course in progressive cities these days. It might look easy and fun to people watching at home. One kid decided he was going to get a gun and go commit some crime. Little punk chose the wrong woman to mess with though.</p><p>Her name is Bond Gill. She's a teacher. And she wasn't in the mood.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">They say you never know how you’ll react until you’re in the moment. <br />This video is making the rounds, showing a woman standing her ground to an attempted armed suspect.

Bond was scared at first, as you can imagine, being that someone was pointing a gun at her in a violent city such as DC.

Meh, Go ahead and shoot me. I don't think you have the grapefruits.</p><p>McDouche, in fact, did not have the grapefruits. He ran off.

She also couldn't help but notice no one came to help her. <em>“We need stronger communities.

## 'The nail in the coffin': Allegedly scientific publication ends scientific inquiry at the behest of the woke

When it became controversial to point out the biological evidence for<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/there-are-only-2-genders-cmm" target="_blank"> the gender binary</a>, it became difficult to take science seriously. When it evolved into Tony Fauci's "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fauci-interview-science-law" target="_blank">The Science</a>"<sup>TM</sup>, it became necessary to be exceptionally skeptical of anything coming out of the mouth of anyone purporting to be a scientist. </p><p>And now, thanks to <em>Nature</em>, one of the preeminent scientific publications on the planet, there's no reason to take anything you see published seriously. In fact, if you're reading something published in <em>Nature</em>, from this point forward, it's just leftist propaganda.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

Nothing is going to make boys capable of becoming girls. Nothing is going to make <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fat-studies-crowder-undercover" target="_blank">obesity </a>healthy. And nothing is going to force everyone to adhere to the delusions the left so often promotes.

## 'At least Gotham City had Batman': Female business owners flee Chicago over crime, blame mayor

Uzma Sharif and Teresa Ging are business owners in Chicago who are about to move out of the city <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/boeing-moves-chicago-virginia" target="_blank">with so many others</a> because Chicago is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-atm-thieves-backhoe" target="_blank">crime-invested suckhole</a>. Blame Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who they say refuses to do anything about it.</p><p>That being said, I kinda wonder who they voted for.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>This is the money quote:</p><p><em>"We can't live like this. The city has become--I would even say Gotham City is a little bit better because you have Batman. Here you don’t have Batman. [...] I’m going where they have well-funded police departments and where they want our business."</em></p><p>Two things. One, it's a slap in the face to everything progressive cities stand for. They're going to a place where they FUND their police. Two, Lori Lightfoot does, in fact, look like she could pass as a Batman villain. Lizard Lady or even the Salamatron.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="d6edd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=31304169&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It's no surprise then that Lightfoot--<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lori-lightfoot-italians" target="_blank">who allegedly has a bigger d*ck than</a>, quote, "the Italians"--<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-mayor-small-businesses" target="_blank">last December</a>, victim-shamed small business owners: "<em>I'm disappointed that they're not doing more </em><em>to take safety and make it a priority. For example, we still have retailers who won't institute plans like having security officers in their stores, making sure that they have cameras operational...</em>."</p><p>She also blamed the businesses for not having merchandise <em>“either chained and roped or put behind glass”</em> or systems where customers are <em>"buzzed into stores."  </em>The city she is the mayor of being overrun by crime? Meh, don't blame her. Besides, what are you going to do... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-republican" target="_blank">vote Republican</a>?</p><p>That's why I'm curious who these two female small business owners voted for. If you review their social media history, will you find that they've previously given Lightfoot a thumbs up <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lori-lightfoot-call" target="_blank">when she used violent rhetoric against pro-lifers</a>? Because the reason progressives like Lightfoot get away with so much is the amount of low-information left-wing voters who are easily manipulated by social issues to vote against their self-interests</p><p>Because if they voted for Lightfoot and the other leaders responsible for pro-crime policies driving them from the city, and they are going to vote for leaders who support the exact same things when they move, they should stay in Chicago.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

And Senator Bernie Sanders says it's not far enough. He says all state colleges should be free because education is invaluable. Education like that provided by the "sexploration" research of Dr. B. Ethan Coston.</p><p><a href="https://campusreform.org/article?id=20041" target="_blank">Campus Reform</a> reports that Coston--an associate professor of gender, sexuality, and women's studies at Virginia Commonwealth University--received a $462,748 grant to conduct research regarding "insights into sex/uality, sexual health, eroticism, and pleasure." The project, idiotically and unseriously named the "Sexploration Project," was awarded the grant in December 2021 and is expected to complete its groundbreaking research in April 2024.</p><p>Coston identifies as "white, neuroqueer, trans, cripple punk," which means she's a totally serious academic perfectly suited to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in the pursuit of truth and science!</p><p>Not really.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

San Francisco is one of the worst, and the businesses in the Castro area claim they are going to do something about it.</p><p>If the city won't deal with the burglaries, vandalism, and both the crazy and homeless people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-schoolchildren" target="_blank">littering the street along with human feces</a>, the businesses are going to stop paying taxes.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p><a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/castro-shops-say-they-wont-pay-taxes-unless-city-addresses-crime-and-homelessness" target="_blank">Castro Merchants Association president Terrance Alan says</a> of the struggle these small business owners need to go through, “Every day we wake up and have to help people on the street. We have to clean up feces on the street. We have to clear our people from doorways, so we can open our businesses. It’s not fair."</p><p>I'll give San Francisco 27% credit. The city has gotten too progressive for even San Fran voters, and they're starting to fight back, recalling their <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-recalled-san-francisco" target="_blank">school board</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chesa-boudlin-lashes-out" target="_blank">district attorney</a>. Unclear is if they're going to replace recalled officials with more of the same and expect different results. But hey! You're trying... Kinda.</p><p>What I'm wondering is how far the merchants plan on taking this. The city has done nothing to save or protect the city. The merchants claim they won't pay taxes. The city is going to respond by saying, "Oh, yes you are!"</p><p>What's the association going to do then? Look down at their feet and mumble, "...oh, okay?"</p><p>It's a bold move that other business owners in other progressive cities should do. They're running out of options other than close shop and move to the suburbs. But the association needs to have the balls to stick with it.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Jason Aldean gets chivalrous AF defending wife Brittney against attacks over her 'transgender' tomboy joke

By "broken his silence," he goofed about it on Instagram, which is all the seriousness the haters deserve. </p><p>To recap, Brittney made a joke on her Instagram page as she was getting herself all dolled up, saying "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittney-aldean-tomboy-instagram" target="_blank">I’d really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my tomboy phase. I love this girly life.</a>" Two other country artists wouldn't calm down about it. Aldean's response was simple. Two words: "My Barbie."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="0c5e0" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31300161&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>This is in reference to Maren Morris' catty comment, "'It’s so easy to, like, not be a scumbag human? Sell your clip-ins and zip it, Insurrection Barbie.'" Get it? Because Brittney is a Trump supporter and has blonde hair.</p><p>Morris was responding to Cassadee Pope, who started the drama by tweeting, "Here we are, hearing someone compare their 'tomboy phase' to someone wanting to transition. Real nice."</p><p>Odd response, because it was clear Brittney wasn't commenting on someone wanting to transition. She was commenting on parents putting their political agenda before their child's well-being and sending them for life-altering surgery over what in many cases is a phase. Nevertheless, Jason persisted. He commented on the initial post where he praised his in-laws. "I'm glad they didn't too, 'cause you and I wouldn't have worked out."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="aeecd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31300163&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Not that Brittney needs <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-instagram-kids-shirt" target="_self">Jason defending her</a>. She's a country girl who can stick up for herself. As opposed to a progressive girl, who claims she doesn't need a man speaking for her, then complains no men are speaking up.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Tax officials now using Google to locate taxpayers with "undeclared" swimming pools

<img class="rm-shortcode" id="f3491" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31299810&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Some of you may read that sentence and ask, "Brodigan, is that something we need to worry about in America?" Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. Sure, our <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-zuckerberg-awesome-wonderful-man" target="_blank">government is in bed with big tech</a>. True, our government just made sure <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-going-for-middle-class" target="_blank">the IRS is the most swole of government agencies</a>. But the White House says <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-87000-white-house" target="_blank">the middle class has nothing to worry about</a>. The fact-checkers repeat what the White House says. So, that is that.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="aa8ed" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31299824&amp;width=980" />
</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/29/french-tax-officials-use-ai-to-spot-20000-undeclared-pools" target="_blank">In France</a>, tax officials are using an AI system developed by Google and Capgemini. During the pandemic, when people were locked down, many installed swimming pools in their backyards. They had nowhere else to go and nothing else to,  so a pool made sense. It's not made clear in <em>The Guardian's</em> article if it was predominately the middle class installing swimming pools. I would assume millionaires and billionaires already had one.</p><p>Like in America--and again, there is no reason for Americans to worry--but like in America, you can't just do things to your property all willy-nilly like. In France, modifications to property must be declared to the tax office within 90 days of completion. That includes swimming pools.</p><p>What this AI developed by Google and used by the French government does is use aerial images to compare your current property with prior images of your property. If there is a swimming pool there that wasn't there before, it cross-references to see if you declare or otherwise got permission. </p><p>If not, the tax collectors come after you. So pay up.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="75b63" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31299841&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>But again, this is happening all the way over in France. There is nothing for anyone in America to worry about it. It couldn't possibly happen here. Our government would never work with Big Tech in such a way. Get that thought out of your head.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">
