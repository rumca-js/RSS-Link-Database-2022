Huawei is the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and one of the top smartphone makers in the globe. The Huawei empire now sells products or carries the traffic of Internet users in 170 countries. And for over a decade, the Shenzen giant faced and dismissed accusations that they have pwned billions of users on behalf of the authoritarian Chinese government. Whether or not there is a Huawei backdoor must be thoroughly scrutinized before any conclusion can be made. Hard evidence is scarce. This is an analysis of all major accusations and allegations of backdoor planted into Huawei products.
