Los Angeles singer-songwriter Madison Cunningham  is getting ready to release her new album, 'Revealer,' on September 9.

Cunningham’s tour included a show at the Fine Line in Minneapolis, which facilitated a visit to The Current studio to play songs from 'Revealer'; watch those performances above.
