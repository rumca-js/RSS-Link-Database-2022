I enjoy Smash Bros. I kinda like Batman. So multiversus works, right?

A somewhat unconventional video for these unprecedented times, I take a look at a game. That’s it. 

Superman is awful, he spams his hit priority like there’s no tommorow. Same with Finn. Bugs ain’t too great either. Glad they’re getting nerfed. 

I don’t need items to be honest. I just figure some people like might them and I assume for long term success adding in more “party elements” may be essential.

Battle pass season 1 could be good, but it got delayed so I guess we won’t know for a bit.
