A note about the exclusive podcast content, we filmed it but unfortunately there was a major audio issue so we couldn't upload it. I've been away for 3 weeks (bet you didn't notice) so it wasn't feasible to re-record it. 

Spotify is a massive titan in the music industry, but how did they get so large and how did the company start?
