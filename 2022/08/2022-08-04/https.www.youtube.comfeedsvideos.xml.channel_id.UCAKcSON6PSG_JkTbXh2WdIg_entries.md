Matthew French had an album in mind a few years ago that was a mix of ballad-like songs and more up-tempo rockers, and he’d release them at two different times. But as the songs unfolded and were recorded, he decided the two formats were split in a different way … by their subject matter. Hence, Matthew’s two releases: Two Sides: Side One, and Two Sides: Side Two. The first side was released earlier this year, and Side Two just came out at the end of July, and each “side” has a slightly different feel due to the lyrics.

Matthew is a guy who’s used to sitting down to sing and play his songs accompanied by his acoustic guitar. But this album called for something different. And to talk about the album and play some of the songs for us, he brought in a local “A Team” of players to support him.
