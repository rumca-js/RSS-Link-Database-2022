But as the songs unfolded and were recorded, he decided the two formats were split in a different way \u2026 by their subject matter. Hence, Matthew\u2019s two releases: Two Sides: Side One, and Two Sides: Side Two. The first side was released earlier this year, and Side Two just came out at the end of July, and each \u201cside\u201d has a slightly different feel due to the lyrics.\n\nMatthew is a guy who\u2019s used to sitting down to sing and play his songs accompanied by his acoustic guitar. But this album called for something different. And to talk about the album and play some of the songs for us, he brought in a local \u201cA Team\u201d of players to support him.\n\nSegments\n00:00 Some Days\n03:30 Interview with host Mike Pengra, part 1\n08:58 A Heart Needs a Place\n12:00 Interview with host Mike Pengra, part 2\n17:02 You Got Me\n\nPersonnel\nMatthew French - vocals, guitar\nSteve Bosmans - lead guitar\nRichard Medek - drums\nSarah Morris - backing vocals\nNick Salisbury - bass\n\nGuest - Matthew French\nHost - Mike Pengra\nVideo - Evan Clark\nAudio - Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operator - Thor Cramer Bornemann\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
