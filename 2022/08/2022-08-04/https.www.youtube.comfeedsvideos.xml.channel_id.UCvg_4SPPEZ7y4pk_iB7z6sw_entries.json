So multiversus works, right?\n\nA somewhat unconventional video for these unprecedented times, I take a look at a game. That\u2019s it. \n\nSuperman is awful, he spams his hit priority like there\u2019s no tommorow. Same with Finn. Bugs ain\u2019t too great either. Glad they\u2019re getting nerfed. \n\nI don\u2019t need items to be honest. I just figure some people like might them and I assume for long term success adding in more \u201cparty elements\u201d may be essential.\n\nBattle pass season 1 could be good, but it got delayed so I guess we won\u2019t know for a bit.\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIJssE2vhgM", "date_published": "2022-08-04 19:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
