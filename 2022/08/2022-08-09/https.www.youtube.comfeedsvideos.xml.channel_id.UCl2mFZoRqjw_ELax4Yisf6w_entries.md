Louis' commentary on FTC report  https://youtu.be/ZKALUEoRd7E FTC agrees with right to repair 

Washington examiner article summarizing report; https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/the-federal-trade-commission-enters-the-fray-over-the-right-to-repair

"The FTC determined that manufacturers could not provide any evidence "to support their argument that injuries are tied to repairs performed by consumers or independent repair shops."

The report also found that tech companies failed to provide any evidence that the right to repair diminished a company's ability to innovate, threatened user security, or inhibited the companies' ability to make competitive products. The FTC concluded, "There is scant evidence to support manufacturers' justifications for repair restrictions." It then encouraged state and federal legislators to consider right-to-repair bills and hopefully pass relevant legislation soon. "
