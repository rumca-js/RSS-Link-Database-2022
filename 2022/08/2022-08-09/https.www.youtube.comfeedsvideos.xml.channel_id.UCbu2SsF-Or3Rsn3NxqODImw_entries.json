This aspect ratio looks great while swinging around New York City fighting crime, as well as during the game\u2019s numerous cinematic cutscenes. However Spider-Man Remastered ultrawide support isn\u2019t without its faults. For example, menu screens such as the map or the skill tree do not support 21:9 displays. We also ran into a visual bug with the waveform UI during calls in the game. Other supported ratios include panoramic 32:9 and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor setups.\n\nThis gameplay was captured using mouse and keyboard controls. This method of playing is serviceable, but does not feel as natural as playing with a controller such as the DualSense, which is supported as well.  \n\nThe PC port of Spider-Man also includes an unlocked frame rate, improved shadows, ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling, Nvidia Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing and more. \n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered is coming to PC on August 12, 2022. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will also come to PC sometime in Fall 2022. \n\nMarvel's Spider-Man originally launched on PlayStation 4 in September 2018. The remastered version came packaged with the ultimate edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which launched with the PlayStation 5 on November 12, 2020.\n\n#gaming #marvelsspiderman #ultrawide", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq9Pjg2kQcU", "date_published": "2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PlayStation Plus Adds More Titles To Its Game Catalog | GameSpot News", "description": "A bunch of games coming to PlayStation Plus, Platoon 3 Direct info, and the DioField Chronicles beta.\n#Gaming #PlayStationPlus #PS5 \n\nMore games coming to PlayStation Plus, Splatoon 3 Direct news, and go hands on with Square Enix\u2019s latest JRPG, DioField Chronicles, early.

All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nA new patch for Elden Ring, 1.06, is now live, and it brings with it some massive adjustments. Previously in the game, you could only put down one summon sign at a time. Even leaving an area would be enough to stop the summon sign from functioning. With this newest patch, players can place multiple summon signs and invade larger areas. This means that it will be easier to pick up some PvP or run around the world while waiting to get summoned for a boss. \n\nThe oft-used and oft-maligned ash of war Bloodstone Step has been nerfed, with decreased distance and fewer invincibility frames, as well as growing less effective with repeated use. \n\nAnother notorious skill, Corpse Piler, now has decreased damage and blood buildup when hit with the blood portion of the attack. Damage caused by hitting enemies with the blade itself has only been slightly decreased. \n\nOther changes make Greatswords, Curved Greatswords, and Great Hammers quicker and an increased roll distance with a light equip load. The patch also fixes dozens of bugs and will now warn players if they are in possession of an unauthorized item such as Deathbed Smalls aka Fia\u2019s underwear. Earlier this year a player ironically named Pantsu Dealer invaded worlds and left the cursed item behind for unsuspecting players to pick up. This resulted in tons of 180-day ban reports from users on Elden Ring\u2019s subreddit. At least now you\u2019ll know ahead of time to toss them because the ban hammer is dropped.  \n\nThe community response to the patch, thus far, has been overwhelmingly positive. Quote tweets and comments abound rejoice at the implemented nerfs and even the buffs to larger and heavier weapons.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n\n00:12 - Elden Ring 1.06 Patch\n02:03 - Xbox Elite Controller\n02:55 - Skyrim Nemesis Mod", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MccxCfRL_Wk", "date_published": "2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Monster Hunter Digital Event (August 2022)", "description": "Tune in to the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Digital Event for new info on the free Title Update 1, including a look at Lucent Nargacuga, Seething Bazelgeuse, and more.\n\nThis digital event is presented by Monster Hunter Series Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and Game Director Yoshitake Suzuki.\n\n#monsterhunter #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVxSLZ0Gqkk", "date_published": "2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
