Poliomyelitis, London, New York and Israel

All children aged 1 to 9 in London to be offered a dose of polio vaccine

Last UK case, 1984

8,000 people developed paralysis every year

Vaccine-derived poliovirus in sewage in north and east London

Genetic diversity (RNA virus)

Most are vaccine-like virus

A few have sufficient mutations to be classified as vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV2),

behaves more like naturally occurring ‘wild’ polio

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

Targeted inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) booster dose,

offered to all children between the ages of 1 and 9 in all London boroughs

This will ensure a high level of protection from paralysis and help reduce further spread of the virus.

The programme will start with the areas affected, 

where the poliovirus has been detected and vaccination rates are low

It’s important all children aged 1 to 9 – even if up to date with their vaccinations – accept this vaccine when offered

Beckton sewage treatment works first

Now also,

Barnet, Brent, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington, Waltham Forest

A total of 116 PV2 isolates identified in 19 sewage samples

An acute illness

Follows invasion through the gastro intestinal tract by polio virus

Virus replicates in the gut

Has a high affinity for nervous tissue

Spread occurs via the bloodstream

Retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system

Often infection is clinically inapparent

Symptoms may range in severity

Fever to 

Headache, 

Gastrointestinal disturbance, 

Malaise

Stiffness of the neck and back

Aseptic meningitis

Paralysis.

Ratio of inapparent to paralytic infections

1000 to 1 in children

75 to 1 in adults

Transmission

Contact with the faeces or pharyngeal secretions

Polio virus replicates long periods in GI tract

Can be excreted for three to six weeks in faeces

Can be excreted for two weeks in saliva

Incubation period

Three to 21 days

When the infection was endemic

Paralytic disease is caused by naturally occurring ‘wild virus’

Live attenuated vaccine, (OPV – Sabin) 
Virus retains the potential to revert to a virulent form,

that can rarely cause paralytic disease

Vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP)

VAPP cases can occur rarely where live attenuated vaccines are used

OPV not used in UK since 2004

(US, not since 2000)

Inactivated polio vaccine (i.m. injected) for routine immunisation

tetanus/diphtheria/inactivated polio vaccine

diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/inactivated polio vaccine 

Recommended at two, three and four months of age,

can be given at any stage from two months up to ten years of age

Largest nuclear power plant in Europe, 6 reactors, at Zaporizhzhia

https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident.aspx

Chernobyl 4 reactor accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel.

The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the environment, 

Reactor core had 192 tonnes of fuel,
with the deposition of radioactive materials in many parts of Europe.

Some 350,000 people were evacuated as a result of the accident

Five million people lived in areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine 
contaminated

A total of 29,400 km2 was contaminated above 180 kBq/m2.

Some 20,000 to 600,000 liquidators irradiated

On 24 February Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces had taken control of all facilities at Chernobyl 

On 9 March the Chernobyl nuclear plant was disconnected from the electricity grid.

Update 88 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine

Ukraine’s Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP)

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needs to send a mission

IAEA has received information about shelling near the spent fuel storage facility.

Friday’s events had breached several of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars

Pillar 1 (Physical integrity)

Pillar 2 (All safety and security systems and equipment must be functional at all times)

Pillar 3 (Operating Staff)

Pillar 4 (Power supply)

Pillar 6 (Radiation monitoring and Emergency Preparedness and Response arrangements)

Director General Grossi Alarmed by Shelling at Ukraine NPP, says IAEA Mission Vital for Nuclear Safety and Security

https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/director-general-grossi-alarmed-by-shelling-at-ukraine-npp-says-iaea-mission-vital-for-nuclear-safety-and-security

Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

Rafael Mariano Grossi

I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in 

Ukraine and beyond.

Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

This must stop and stop now.

I have been ready to lead a mission of IAEA safety, security and safeguards experts to the country’s biggest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzya.

We can’t afford to lose any more time.

Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general

end to the suicidal military operations around the plant

Karine Jean-Pierre, White House spokesman

Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous
