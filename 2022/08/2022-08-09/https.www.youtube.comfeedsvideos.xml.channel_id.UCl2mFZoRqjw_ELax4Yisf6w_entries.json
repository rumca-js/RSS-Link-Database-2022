The FTC concluded, \"There is scant evidence to support manufacturers' justifications for repair restrictions.\" It then encouraged state and federal legislators to consider right-to-repair bills and hopefully pass relevant legislation soon. \"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sd439IGQA", "date_published": "2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
