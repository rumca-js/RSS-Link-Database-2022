Cult of the Lamb is a delightfully demented rogue-like that combines fast-paced dungeoneering, bold art, dark topics, and real-time simulation elements to create a one-of-a-kind

## Marvel's Spider-Man PC Ultrawide Mouse & Keyboard Gameplay

See Marvel's Spider-Man in action on PC, running at ultrawide resolution using mouse and keyboard controls.

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is now available on PC and with it comes support for ultrawide 21:9 displays. This aspect ratio looks great while swinging around New York City fighting crime, as well as during the game’s numerous cinematic cutscenes. However Spider-Man Remastered ultrawide support isn’t without its faults. For example, menu screens such as the map or the skill tree do not support 21:9 displays. We also ran into a visual bug with the waveform UI during calls in the game. Other supported ratios include panoramic 32:9 and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor setups.

This gameplay was captured using mouse and keyboard controls. This method of playing is serviceable, but does not feel as natural as playing with a controller such as the DualSense, which is supported as well.  

The PC port of Spider-Man also includes an unlocked frame rate, improved shadows, ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling, Nvidia Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing and more. 

Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is coming to PC on August 12, 2022. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will also come to PC sometime in Fall 2022. 

Marvel's Spider-Man originally launched on PlayStation 4 in September 2018. The remastered version came packaged with the ultimate edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which launched with the PlayStation 5 on November 12, 2020.

#Gaming #PlayStationPlus #PS5 

More games coming to PlayStation Plus, Splatoon 3 Direct news, and go hands on with Square Enix’s latest JRPG, DioField Chronicles, early. All this on today’s GameSpot news, coming to you from inside Spider-Man 2018 (I’m in the office and gonna see about recording on the roof. Will cut this gag if that location isn’t feasible.)

Sony has revealed the next batch of free games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. The August 2022 PS Plus Game Catalog lineup includes not one but three Yakuza games, a recent remake in the Mana series, the latest Ghost Recon, and more, coming to the service on August 16.

To start, you can live your Japanese crime family fantasies with Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2. Those mark the start of Yakuza offerings on PS Plus with others set to come later this year. Extra and Premium members can also get the 1v4 multiplayer game Dead by Daylight, as well as Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands and the extremely wacky adventure game Bugsnax.

Rounding out the new additions will be Metro Exodus, Trials of Mana, Uno, Monopoly Madness, and Monopoly Plus.

These are the premium extras for the higher tiers, separate from the PlayStation Plus Essentials games lineup. Extra and Premium members can grab those games too, which this month include Tony Hawk, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and Little Nightmares.

## Elden Ring Patch 1.06 Explained - Nerfs, Buffs, and Fixes

Elden Ring gets a substantial patch, a new Xbox Elite controller is on its way, and Skyrim gets a Nemesis System.
#Gaming #EldenRing #Xbox 

Elden Ring is getting some of its biggest changes yet, a new Xbox Elite controller could be coming soon, and Skyrim gets a fun mod. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

A new patch for Elden Ring, 1.06, is now live, and it brings with it some massive adjustments. Previously in the game, you could only put down one summon sign at a time. Even leaving an area would be enough to stop the summon sign from functioning. With this newest patch, players can place multiple summon signs and invade larger areas. This means that it will be easier to pick up some PvP or run around the world while waiting to get summoned for a boss. 

The oft-used and oft-maligned ash of war Bloodstone Step has been nerfed, with decreased distance and fewer invincibility frames, as well as growing less effective with repeated use. 

Another notorious skill, Corpse Piler, now has decreased damage and blood buildup when hit with the blood portion of the attack. Damage caused by hitting enemies with the blade itself has only been slightly decreased. 

Other changes make Greatswords, Curved Greatswords, and Great Hammers quicker and an increased roll distance with a light equip load. The patch also fixes dozens of bugs and will now warn players if they are in possession of an unauthorized item such as Deathbed Smalls aka Fia’s underwear. Earlier this year a player ironically named Pantsu Dealer invaded worlds and left the cursed item behind for unsuspecting players to pick up. This resulted in tons of 180-day ban reports from users on Elden Ring’s subreddit. At least now you’ll know ahead of time to toss them because the ban hammer is dropped.  

The community response to the patch, thus far, has been overwhelmingly positive. Quote tweets and comments abound rejoice at the implemented nerfs and even the buffs to larger and heavier weapons.
