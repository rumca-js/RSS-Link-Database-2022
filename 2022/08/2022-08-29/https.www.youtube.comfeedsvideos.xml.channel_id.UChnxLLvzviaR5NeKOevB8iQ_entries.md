I performed at Velocity in Seattle on the Digitakt, Syntakt, and Microcosm. I'll walk through the setup and theory behind the rig and then perform the set for you.

Get the set as an album on my Bandcamp VIP, which includes the projects for the Digitakt and Syntakt: https://soundvision.bandcamp.com/album/velocity-22

Patrons get the performance and stuff too!
