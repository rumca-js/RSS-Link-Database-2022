I've been a huge fan of prop makers since seeing the work of Wētā Workshop in the LOTR Appendices, so I'm excited to take an up-close look at one of Gil-galad's prop rings made by Into the Fire Jewelry for the upcoming The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power series.

While this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)
