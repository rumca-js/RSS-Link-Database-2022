Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#theringsofpower #gilgalad #unboxing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVVOBvt7u9c", "date_published": "2022-08-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
