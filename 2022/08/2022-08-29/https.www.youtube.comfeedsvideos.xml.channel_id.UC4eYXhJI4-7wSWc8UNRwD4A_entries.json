Tiny Desk and Jazz Night in America celebrate the 20th anniversary of Juilliard Jazz with three Tiny Desk concerts featuring performances by current students and alumni of the prestigious institution.\n\nNikki Birch | August 29, 2022\nClad in a fringed, royal blue halter suit, bassist Endea Owens and her band The Cookout were all smiles. Although she\u2019s no stranger to the Tiny Desk (playing with Jon Batiste in 2020) Owens was giddy with excitement to perform her own music with fellow Juilliard alumni. She spoke about the importance of using her music to speak for the voiceless, and to build and enrich communities. She\u2019s not all talk either \u2014 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the house bassist for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has hosted community cookouts, playing music for people in Harlem and handing out hundreds of free meals. \n\nThe first tune \u201cWhere the Nubians Grow\u201d is a head-bobbing groove dedicated to her hometown of Detroit. With \u201cFeel Good,\u201d her fierce intro gives way to a catchy bass line that the band joyfully hopscotches over. Owens then dims the proverbial lights with \u201cLove Cynical\u201d a song that gives ballroom jazz with silky horn lines and a sensuous beat. Before we can get too cozy, the band erupts into \u201cCycles,\u201d a dizzying showcase for horns and drums.\n\nTo close her shows, Owens always asks audiences to participate in affirmations allowing a continuation of the positive vibes. After a brief introduction of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d the band plays \u201cFor the People (In dedication to Taleshia Chandler),\u201d another uplifting number. This Tiny Desk energized the whole room, each musician a master of their instrument. Owens joked: \u201cWe are all Juilliard alumni, so you can hear it in the sound.\u201d \n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cWhere the Nubians Grow\u201d\n\u201cFeel Good\u201d\n\u201cLove Cynical\u201d\n\u201cCycles\u201d\n\u201cFor the People (In dedication to Taleshia Chandler)\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nEndea Owens: bass\nGiveton Gelin: trumpet\nJeffery Miller: trombone\nZoe Obadia: alto saxophone\nLee Pearson: drums\nJonathan Thomas: piano\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Nikki Birch\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Kara Frame\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Pierre Kattar, Michael Zamora\nAnimator: Alant\u00e9 Serene\nAudio Assistant: Natasha Branch\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #endeaowens", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD3vTmbIZdU", "date_published": "2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
