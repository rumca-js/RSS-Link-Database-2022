Pregnant women now a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination

There's no evidence COVID-19 vaccination increases the risk of having a miscarriage, pre-term birth or other complications in your pregnancy.

The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any live viruses and cannot give you or your baby COVID-19.

JCVI issues new advice on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-issues-new-advice-on-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-women

The JCVI has advised that pregnant women should be offered the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population, based on their age and clinical risk group.

Based on this (US) data

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

Advises that it’s preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available. 

There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed.

The Green Book

advises that pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their clinician, 

including the latest evidence on safety and which vaccines they should receive.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JCVI

We encourage pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their clinician 

There is more real-world safety data from the US in relation to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in women who are pregnant – 

therefore, we advise a preference for these to be offered to pregnant women.
