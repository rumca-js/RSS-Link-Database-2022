The loss of superpower status is an injury that Vladimir Putin has made it his life’s work to reverse.</p><p>Mr Gorbachev did not intend for his democratising reforms to dissolve the USSR. In some former Soviet republics he is remembered more as a repressor of pro-independence movements than as a liberator. Events ran away from him. The Russia that was born from Soviet ruin was not a creature of his design, and the failure of its subsequent experiment in political freedom tainted his legacy. For many Russians, chaos and criminality contaminated the concept of democracy. Mr Putin capitalised on that disillusionment to restore authoritarianism with a neo-Soviet, nationalist inflection, of which his murderous assault on Ukraine is an expression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-gorbachevs-legacy-the-hope-endures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Extreme heat has caused trees to shed their leaves early and summer crops to give up. It’s nature’s equivalent of grabbing whatever you can when leaving a burning building</p><p>The first cool mornings, the sweet rot of fallen apples, the sight of seed heads – these are all signs that autumn is here. But what happens when it starts coming earlier? When the floor is littered with burnt leaves, when the summer crops give up early and the flowers fade before all the pollinators get their fill? What has happened is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-this-false-autumn-an-uncanny-beauty">“false” autumn</a> .</p><p>The leaves on the ground of your local park and pavements are not autumn leaves, where a deciduous tree has reclaimed as many valuable chemicals as possible from the leaf, so that the colours beneath are exposed, before sending it to ground. The extraction of pigments in a leaf is a slow process that takes trees several weeks, but the blast of extreme heat stole this from the plants and instead they had to slough off resources as they struggled to stay hydrated. These are the leaves we see right now: brown, curled and fried by the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/31/leaves-autumn-extreme-heat-trees-crops-nature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The visual splendour of this rich, gorgeous Tolkien drama will make you gawp throughout. Watch it on the largest TV you can</p><p>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lord-Rings-Power-Season/dp/B09QH97PTF">Prime Video</a>) is likely to prove divisive, not least depending on whether you watch it on a big TV or squint at its splendour on a phone or laptop. It is so rich and gorgeous that it is easy to spend the first episode simply gawping at the landscapes, as it swoops and swooshes between the lands of elves and dwarves, humans and harfoots. This is TV that is made for big screens, although surely destined to be watched on smaller ones. It is so cinematic and grand that it makes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/house-of-the-dragon-review-this-game-of-thrones-prequel-is-gorgeous-opulent-television">House of the Dragon</a> look as if it has been cobbled together on Minecraft.</p><p>This makes it difficult to judge The Rings of Power as an ordinary series, because so much about it is extraordinary. It is Tolkien, which means this world is already venerated and beloved by so many, whether in the form of the books, Peter Jackson’s films or both. There is an extraordinary weight of expectation before any viewer presses play. Add to that the fact that this is reportedly the most expensive TV series ever made – $465m for eight episodes – and it is tough to view this as just another show. It is an event, a spectacle, but if it isn’t entirely perfect, does that make it a failure?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/31/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-review-so-astounding-it-makes-house-of-the-dragon-look-amateur">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Covid, exorbitant overheads and burnout have convinced a host of big names that the capital is no longer the place to be. Now settled in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, they have created a new foodie destination</p><p>In Somerset, it has been a prolific summer for courgettes. I know this because they feature in at least three of the 10 dishes on the menu at <a href="https://www.oldpharmacybruton.com/">the Old Pharmacy</a> in Bruton. “We’re inundated,” says its chef patron, Merlin Labron-Johnson. I can’t decide between the tromboncino scapece – coins of a thin, curling, pastel-green courgette native to Italy, fried in garlicky olive oil then quick-pickled in vinegar, served cold as an antipasto – and a bigger dish of grilled chunks of yellow courgette with preserved lemon, courgette cream, nasturtiums and salty, lemony almonds. I order both.</p><p>The Old Pharmacy’s blackboard menu is a snapshot of what is good and in season not just in the area, but at Labron-Johnson’s nearby farm, where he grows almost all of the fresh produce that this and <a href="https://osiprestaurant.com/">Osip</a>, his small, high-end restaurant next door, put to work in their kitchens. “We grow every vegetable, herb and fruit that it’s possible to grow in the UK,” he says, not least all those courgettes. “And we don’t need to look much further than Somerset for everything else – we have Westcombe for cheese, Bruton Organic Dairy for meat, and in winter we go to a local hunter for game.” The scapece arrives crowned with basil leaves and swimming in a golden pool of peppery olive oil; I order bread to mop it up, which arrives with a blob of freshly churned, salted butter. I’m in Somerset; it would be rude not to.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/31/i-was-so-much-happier-outside-london-how-top-chefs-found-heaven-in-the-west-country">Continue reading...</a>
