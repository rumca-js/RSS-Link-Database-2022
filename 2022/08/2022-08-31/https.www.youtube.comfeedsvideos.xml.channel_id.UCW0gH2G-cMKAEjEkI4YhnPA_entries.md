After seeing the first two episodes of Rings of Power in NYC, I thought I'd share my non-spoiler thoughts on the first 2+ hours as a whole. While there's some things I'm still not convinced of their necessity (harfoots), there were moments of splendor and heart (Khazad-dum).  I have some quibbles with some of the (particularly First Age) choices, but overall, I think it was a really solid launch for the series and I'm excited to see more!
