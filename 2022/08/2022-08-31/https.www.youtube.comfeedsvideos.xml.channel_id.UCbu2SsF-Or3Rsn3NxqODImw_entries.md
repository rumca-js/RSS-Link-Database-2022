Assassin’s Creed Mirage has been confirmed, Zelda remake rumors have surfaced again and a Halo Infinite’s couch co-op has been canceled.

Following a handful of leaks, Ubisoft has officially announced the next game in the Assassin’s Creed series:Mirage. Unfortunately, that confirmation is all we’re getting today and the company has said more details will be shared during the September 10th Ubisoft Forward. For the time being we can look to the leaked information for a decent picture of what to expect. 

Mirage will reportedly star Basim, a character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, in his youth, leading up to when he arrived at the Hidden Ones. The game will do away with dialogue choices and the ability to select a gender. The game will reportedly take place in Baghdad in late '800s and will also be a "return to basics" for the series with no leveling.This back-to-basics approach is inspired by 2007’s original Assassin's Creed; a game that Ubisoft is allegedly working on a remake for. This alleged remake will be part of Mirage's season pass, and there will also be Constantinople DLC. According to reports, Mirage will launch in Spring 2023. 

And if you’re a Nintendo fan then you’ll want to pay attention to the week of September 12. A source told Jeff Grubb of our sister site Giant Bomb that the next Nintendo Direct may be held in that week. Grubb discussed the possibilities with Mike Minotti of GamesBeat and Mike said the rumored event will include the announcement of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess ports for Nintendo Switch. Both games were already updated on Wii U, but they haven't been re-released on Switch yet. Whether or not this is a general Nintendo Direct that includes details on franchises outside of Zelda remains to be seen. Grubb went on to say that a Metroid Prime remaster is also in the works and could be announced at an upcoming Nintendo Direct.

Sekiro meets God of War in A44's Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, the developer's follow up to their previous game, Ashen.
#gaming #flintlock #gamespot

Mechanically, Flintlock's combat sort of looks like how you fight in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with an armor system that works in a similar manner to Sekiro's posture.

In Flintlock, enemies have two different meters that you have to worry about while in combat. The red bar is an enemy's health, while the yellow bar above that is their armor. The yellow bar fills as you damage an enemy's armor while the red bar empties as you damage the enemy themselves.

Attacks deal damage, while both attacks and parries chip away at an enemy's armor. When the armor bar is filled, protagonist Nor is able to land a devastating execution attack against her foe. In most cases against normal enemies, it looks like these executions kill her targets outright. 

However, stronger enemies and bosses can seemingly withstand multiple versions of these attacks. They're still worth doing though, because when it comes to these more powerful targets, Nor can use this execution attack to rip away an enemy's literal armor, like a shield or breastplate, that makes them more vulnerable to your attacks.

In Flintlock, an enemy's armor meter begins to deplete if you back off, encouraging you to be aggressive in combat and rely on parries and dodges instead of blocks. In combat, you can combat Nor's companion, Enki, to stun enemies and stop their armor meter from depleting, but it looks like you can only do this to one enemy at a time.

Nor has armor too. Powerful attacks, like unblockable attacks that are symbolized by a red aura, can cut into that armor and damage it. Once it's broken, Nor takes increased damage from enemy attacks. Thankfully, there's a way to replenish Nor's armor, which leads us into our next point.

Let’s meet a newly-discovered Pokémon: Grafaiai. This Toxic Monkey Pokémon uses its poisonous saliva – which changes color depending on what the Pokémon eats – to attack foes by spitting at them.

Grafaiai is a moody Pokémon with a fastidious disposition. It doesn’t form packs, preferring to roam alone, and it is constantly caught up in territorial struggles with other Pokémon. Grafaiai specializes in using its poisonous saliva—which changes color depending on what the Pokémon eats—to attack foes by spitting at them or by slashing at them after coating its claws with the saliva.
 
Grafaiai is nocturnal and once the sun sets it licks its hands and fingers to cover them in poison and uses them to draw patterns on the trees in its territory. The poisonous saliva it uses to paint paralyzes Bug Pokémon, which are drawn to the saliva’s sweet, fragrant scent.

The Last of Us is an excellent game, but is the $70 dollar remake worth you time and money? Jake Dekker breaks down out all the new additions and shares his thoughts on Naughty Dog's controversial remake.

In this video Jake breaks down everything from the improved visuals to the new extra features. There's a lot here, but if you've already played The Last of Us, and the story didn't do much for you, then maybe you should wait.

Fans will really appreciate all the new improvements though. The sound design in particular is really great. The clickers are more terrifying, the gunshots ring in your ears, and the combat sounds more impactful.

The Last of Us Part I comes to PlayStation 5 on September 2nd. If you want to check out raw 4K gameplay of the opening scene, stop by our YouTube channel and let us know what you think.

September 2022's PS Plus Essential lineup will include Need for Speed Heat, Toem, and Granblue Fantasy: Versus. This new batch of games will be available starting September 6 and all PS Plus subscribers, regardless of tier, can claim the PlayStation Plus Essential lineup each month.

If you haven't already, make sure to claim the August freebies before they leave PlayStation Plus on September 6. That lineup is 3 for 3 with absolute bangers: Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, and Little Nightmares. Don’t miss out.

When it comes to God of War Ragnarok, two of the lead combat designers for the game, Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh, have broken the silence, offering some insight on new combat abilities for the former Spartan.

Speaking with Game Informer, Sheth and Yeh have detailed some of Kratos's new combat techniques, including the ability to infuse both the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos with enhanced elemental properties depending on the weapon--ice for the Axe and fire for the Blades. Doing so activates new Weapon Signature Moves--Frost Awaken for the Axe and Whiplash for the Blades--which will inflict massive damage on enemies.

The Last of Us Part I looks pretty dang good. Here's the first 20 minutes of Naughty Dog's epic post-apocalyptic adventure.

In this scene we see the heartbreaking opening to The Last of Us Part 1. It can be difficult to watch so that keep that in mind. The game opens in Austin, Texas on Joel's birthday. He gets home to his daughter Sarah who stayed up waiting for him.

Quickly things go south and Joel's neighbors break in. From there, Tommy, Joel, and Sarah hop in a car and try to escape the city.

This is set to fidelity mode meaning it favors resolution of framerate, and was captured in 4K.

The Last of Us Part I is available for PS5 on September 2nd.

In Jake's 4K review he highlights the major improvements and how they affect the overall experience. The Last of Us Part I also includes the fantastic DLC story, Left Behind. If you've never played The Last of Us and you own a PS5, this is the perfect to experience this world. Keep in mind that it isn't always for the faint of heart.

The Last of Us Part I comes to PS5 on September 2.
