Criminals have the right to commit crimes <strong>IN TIMES SQUARE</strong> because they know the Hochul Democrats won't punish them and will let them back out onto the street if they promise never to do it again. Criminals also have the freedom to promise never to do it again every time they get caught breaking that promise.</p><p>But you don't have the freedom to carry a firearm to protect you and your loved ones from the crime-invested suckhole NYC is turning into. The sign says so.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">You Should Be Worried About THIS from the IRS | Louder With Crowder</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3lgUf5U85zg\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/times-square-gun-free-zone", "date_published": "2022-08-31 16:23:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Father shoots daughter's ex-boyfriend as he tries to break into house", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31362004&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C118\" /><br /><br /><p>The second amendment is paramount. It is meant to allow people to protect themselves. Primarily, it forces the government to think twice about devolving into despotism, but it also allows citizens to<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/activist-complains-good-guy-gun\" target=\"_blank\"> protect themselves from all who would do them harm</a>, like James Rayl, who was plugged full of holes as he attempted to break through a door to get to his ex-girlfriend. </p><p>Allyson Duckro had broken up with Rayl over a year before this incident, reports the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11164589/Ohio-father-52-seen-LAUGHING-cops-hours-shooting-dead-daughters-ex-boyfriend.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail</a>, but on July 31, he attempted to force his way into Duckro's family home. Luckily, Mitchell Duckro, Allyson's father, was there with access to a 9-mm pistol registered to his father-in-law. Video captured by the home's Ring doorbell shows Rayl attempting to ram through the front door of the home before being shot several times through the door. <strong>[WARNING: GRAPHIC]</strong></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"></div><p>Look, I'm okay with this.<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/homeowner-front-porch-invasion\" target=\"_blank\"> If you're committing any crime</a>, I think <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-video-games-second-amendment\" target=\"_blank\">you're taking your life in your own hands</a>. Frankly, if it were me inside that house, I wouldn't have waited nearly as long before letting loose with a good ol' can of F*ck Off Spray<sup>TM</sup>.</p><p>Now, Duckro isn't about to face criminal charges. A grand jury already voted not to indict him based on Ohio's \"Stand Your Ground Law.\" And that's good. That's how this should go. It isn't stopping Rayl's family from screaming murder. \"Rayl's family have launched a 'Justice for James' campaign, saying he was 'murdered' by Duckro and that 'justice will be served.'\"</p><p>Justice was served. And while I understand Rayl's family is upset, he was obviously out to do something, and he it was a good shoot.</p><p>The headline at the Daily Mail, however, reads like something meant to malign Duckro. It reads, \"Ohio father, 52, LAUGHS in interview with cops hours after shooting dead his daughter's ex-boyfriend when he tried to storm their home and admits the firearm wasn't registered to him.\" Yeah, it's a mouthful. It's also misleading.</p><p>The firearm being registered to him is immaterial. He was still in lawful possession of the firearm. And while he laughs, watch this interview and you tell me if he's laughing like the maniacal, cold-blooded killer the headline makes him out to be. [Note: the laugh comes in the last few seconds of the interview and isn't even in relation to the shooting itself.]</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"></div><p>He laughs in regards to the notion that a teenage girl would talk to her father about her dating life. That's laughable.</p><p>Frankly, if it were me, I might chuckle in relief. The guy deserved what he got. Someone get Mr. Duckro a new, shiny \"#1 Dad\" mug and a cold beer with which to fill it.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Touching Montage of Patriots In Self-Defense | Louder With Crowder</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muCMz1u--jI\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n</small>\n</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/father-shoots-daughters-ex-defense", "date_published": "2022-08-31 14:55:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "'We've been voting Dem for 59 years': Charles Barkley goes off on Democrats failing the black community", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31360467&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C20%2C0%2C98\" /><br /><br /><p>I can never say no to a clip of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=charles+barkley\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Barkley</a> talking about politics.

Also, Republicans aren't the ones telling him he can't talk about those big ol' San Antonio women anymore.</p><p>But Sir Charles' point that you shouldn't blindly trust any political party is spot on. Republicans promise conservatives the world. Yet, elect Republicans in the most Republican states in America, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-choice-utah-governor\" target=\"_blank\">and they'll still sell you out even on issues that unite everyone</a>.</p><p>Politicians look out for themselves.

I know that you know that this is what happens behind the scenes. It's the cavalier, nonchalant way in which he says it, as if this is the standard way of doing things. And it is so accepted that there is no argument about the matter. \"More progressive teachers are actually more savvy about delivering a Democratic message without really ever having to mention politics.\" So, you're admitting you hire teachers based on their politics and the politicos they are going to push on captive students.</p><p>I mean, really dude?</p><p>\u201cThe conservative teacher, who is stuck in her ways.

Though, I am curious how they weed out the Catholics from the Protestants. You wouldn't think a New England public school board administrator would know the difference.

And that's just parents who assume public school administrators hate them.
