Unfortunately, that confirmation is all we\u2019re getting today and the company has said more details will be shared during the September 10th Ubisoft Forward. For the time being we can look to the leaked information for a decent picture of what to expect. \n\nMirage will reportedly star Basim, a character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, in his youth, leading up to when he arrived at the Hidden Ones. The game will do away with dialogue choices and the ability to select a gender. The game will reportedly take place in Baghdad in late '800s and will also be a \"return to basics\" for the series with no leveling.This back-to-basics approach is inspired by 2007\u2019s original Assassin's Creed; a game that Ubisoft is allegedly working on a remake for. This alleged remake will be part of Mirage's season pass, and there will also be Constantinople DLC. According to reports, Mirage will launch in Spring 2023. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re a Nintendo fan then you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the week of September 12. A source told Jeff Grubb of our sister site Giant Bomb that the next Nintendo Direct may be held in that week. Grubb discussed the possibilities with Mike Minotti of GamesBeat and Mike said the rumored event will include the announcement of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess ports for Nintendo Switch. Both games were already updated on Wii U, but they haven't been re-released on Switch yet. Whether or not this is a general Nintendo Direct that includes details on franchises outside of Zelda remains to be seen. Grubb went on to say that a Metroid Prime remaster is also in the works and could be announced at an upcoming Nintendo Direct.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage\n01:33 - September Nintendo Direct\n02:29 - Halo Infinite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhlfTTUabI", "date_published": "2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn Mashes Up Sekiro And God of War Combat", "description": "Sekiro meets God of War in A44's Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, the developer's follow up to their previous game, Ashen.\n#gaming #flintlock #gamespot\n\nMechanically, Flintlock's combat sort of looks like how you fight in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with an armor system that works in a similar manner to Sekiro's posture.\n\nIn Flintlock, enemies have two different meters that you have to worry about while in combat. The red bar is an enemy's health, while the yellow bar above that is their armor. The yellow bar fills as you damage an enemy's armor while the red bar empties as you damage the enemy themselves.\n\nAttacks deal damage, while both attacks and parries chip away at an enemy's armor. When the armor bar is filled, protagonist Nor is able to land a devastating execution attack against her foe. In most cases against normal enemies, it looks like these executions kill her targets outright. \n\nHowever, stronger enemies and bosses can seemingly withstand multiple versions of these attacks. They're still worth doing though, because when it comes to these more powerful targets, Nor can use this execution attack to rip away an enemy's literal armor, like a shield or breastplate, that makes them more vulnerable to your attacks.\n\nIn Flintlock, an enemy's armor meter begins to deplete if you back off, encouraging you to be aggressive in combat and rely on parries and dodges instead of blocks. In combat, you can combat Nor's companion, Enki, to stun enemies and stop their armor meter from depleting, but it looks like you can only do this to one enemy at a time.\n\nNor has armor too. Powerful attacks, like unblockable attacks that are symbolized by a red aura, can cut into that armor and damage it. Once it's broken, Nor takes increased damage from enemy attacks. Thankfully, there's a way to replenish Nor's armor, which leads us into our next point.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDzWHqDFZPc", "date_published": "2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Pok\u00e9mon Violet | Introducing Grafaiai Trailer", "description": "Let\u2019s meet a newly-discovered Pok\u00e9mon: Grafaiai.
