Plus, a new Call of Duty skin is accused of copying art from Dr Disrespect\u2019s Deadrop. \n#GamingNews #CallofDuty #Warzone2 \n\nThe since deleted image appeared to show internal documentation related to readiness for various upcoming Activision Blizzard launches, such as the recently announced release date of the pre-patch for WoW: Wrath of the Lich King Classic. If the image is indeed legitimate, WoW players can expect to have their hands on the game's next expansion, Dragonflight, on November 28, with the game's pre-patch arriving roughly a month earlier, on October 25. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2 could be launching November 16, several weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. In addition to Warzone 2, the document lists a release of October 27 for something called \"COD Cortez,\" which may be the heavily rumored (and seemingly confirmed) DMZ mode for the upcoming shooter.\n\nIn other Call of Duty news, Activision has announced a new preorder bonus for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and it's a first-of-its-kind offer for the franchise. Everyone who digitally preorders Modern Warfare II will get access to the game's campaign mode \"up to\" a week early, starting on October 20. The game releases officially on October 28. Preordering Modern Warfare II also gets you early access to the multiplayer beta, which begins September 16 on PlayStation before coming to Xbox and PC later.\n\nActivision has released the new \"Doomsayer\" operator skin in Call of Duty: Warzone and Vanguard, but players are already pointing out major similarities with artwork from Dr Disrespect's upcoming Deadrop game.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:05 - Warzone 2\n01:22 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:51 - Call of Duty & Deadrop", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV7N2hO6-8o", "date_published": "2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II Campaign Early Access Official Teaser Trailer", "description": "Take a sneak peek at the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign in this latest teaser trailer.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare releases October 28, 2022, but if you pre-order you can get access to the campaign early.\n\n#modernwarfare2 #callofduty #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1x0BHMsSA", "date_published": "2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Everything To Know About Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, we\u2019re giving you all the information you need about Fortnite x Dragon Ball and revealing what you can expect from the next Game Pass drop.\n#GamingNews #Fortnite #DragonBallSuper\n\nthe Fortnite Dragon Ball Super collaboration is officially underway.

Here's GameSpot's review.\n\nRollerdrome is similar to Roll7's other titles in that it's a single-player skating game that emphasizes performing tricks, but this isn't just an OlliOlli game with guns. Rollerdrome eschews the side-scrolling nature of Roll7's famous platformer series for fully 3D skate park-like arenas; as you skate through a single area, you must utilize walls and ramps to loop yourself around and to perform tricks.\n\nThough it makes departures from the skating games that Roll7 is known for, Rollerdrome nails what's most important about them: it's an easy game to play that makes you feel awesome while you're playing it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siMJklKuyPQ", "date_published": "2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Thymesia Review", "description": "Thymesia creates a Souls-like experience that iterates on what's most important about FromSoftware's beloved titles Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.\n\n#Gaming #GameSpot #Thymesia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihGDFIDmP9o", "date_published": "2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
