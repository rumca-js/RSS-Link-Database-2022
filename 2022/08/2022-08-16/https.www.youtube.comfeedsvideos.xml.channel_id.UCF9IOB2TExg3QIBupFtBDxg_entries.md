Cardiovascular Effects of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Adolescents

https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202208.0151/v1

Study focuses on cardiovascular effects, 

particularly myocarditis and pericarditis events, 

after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine injection,

in Thai adolescents, 13 to 18, both sexes 

This prospective cohort study,

students from two schools aged 13â€“18 years,

who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. 

All healthy and without any abnormal symptoms before receiving the second dose of vaccine. 

Data collected

Demographics

Symptoms

Vital signs

ECG, echocardiography

Cardiac enzymes

Collected 

at baseline, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14

N =  314

Analysis, n = 301

Cardiovascular effects

Found in 29.24% of patients,

ranging from tachycardia, palpitation, and myopericarditis. 

Most common cardiovascular effects

Tachycardia, 7.64%

Shortness of breath, 6.64%

Palpitation, 4.32%

Chest pain, 4.32%

Hypertension, 3.99%

Abnormal ECG finding, 54 patients (17.94%) 

Seven participants (2.33%)

(all male)

At least one elevated cardiac biomarker or positive lab assessments

Myopericarditis

Confirmed in one patient after vaccination. 

Two patients had suspected pericarditis

Four patients had suspected subclinical myocarditis 

Three patients had minimal pericardial effusion 

Myocarditis and Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.693085

Myocarditis accounts for up to 20% of sudden cardiac deaths in young adults. 

During the follow-up period, (14 days)

After receiving the second dose of vaccine, 

two patients were hospitalized,

one patient was supervised in the ICU during hospitalization, 

(mainly for observation of arrhythmia).

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of myopericarditis after vaccination was usually mild, with all cases fully recovering within 14 days. 

Hence, adolescents receiving mRNA vaccines should be monitored for side effects.

Male adolescents and male young adults are at the highest risk of myocarditis after an mRNA vaccination.

Vaccines for COVID-19

COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and free.

COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Teens
