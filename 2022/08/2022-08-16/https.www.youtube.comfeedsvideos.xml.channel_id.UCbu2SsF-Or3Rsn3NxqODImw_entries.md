The since deleted image appeared to show internal documentation related to readiness for various upcoming Activision Blizzard launches, such as the recently announced release date of the pre-patch for WoW: Wrath of the Lich King Classic. If the image is indeed legitimate, WoW players can expect to have their hands on the game's next expansion, Dragonflight, on November 28, with the game's pre-patch arriving roughly a month earlier, on October 25. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2 could be launching November 16, several weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. In addition to Warzone 2, the document lists a release of October 27 for something called "COD Cortez," which may be the heavily rumored (and seemingly confirmed) DMZ mode for the upcoming shooter.

In other Call of Duty news, Activision has announced a new preorder bonus for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and it's a first-of-its-kind offer for the franchise. Everyone who digitally preorders Modern Warfare II will get access to the game's campaign mode "up to" a week early, starting on October 20. The game releases officially on October 28. Preordering Modern Warfare II also gets you early access to the multiplayer beta, which begins September 16 on PlayStation before coming to Xbox and PC later.

Activision has released the new "Doomsayer" operator skin in Call of Duty: Warzone and Vanguard, but players are already pointing out major similarities with artwork from Dr Disrespect's upcoming Deadrop game.

## Rollerdrome Review

Developer Roll7 excellently mixes high-scoring skating gameplay with shooter ideas to make a hybrid game that's tough to put down. Here's GameSpot's review.

Rollerdrome is similar to Roll7's other titles in that it's a single-player skating game that emphasizes performing tricks, but this isn't just an OlliOlli game with guns. Rollerdrome eschews the side-scrolling nature of Roll7's famous platformer series for fully 3D skate park-like arenas; as you skate through a single area, you must utilize walls and ramps to loop yourself around and to perform tricks.

Though it makes departures from the skating games that Roll7 is known for, Rollerdrome nails what's most important about them: it's an easy game to play that makes you feel awesome while you're playing it.

Thymesia creates a Souls-like experience that iterates on what's most important about FromSoftware's beloved titles Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
