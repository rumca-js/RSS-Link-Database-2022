This bill is about to Create and extend clean energy tax Credits, Increase public transit; give people money to make energy efficient improvements to their homes and businesses, it creates a federal Green Bank for climate projects; Invests in clean energy for rural communities; it drops a cool $60 billion in environmental justice priorities, Develops more efficient airplane fuel; Makes affordable housing more efficient and resilient, Funds agricultural conservation; punishes methane polluters, Protects old growth National Forests; Restores and protects coastal communities and marine habitats, Create union jobs and increase worker protections; Lowers energy costs for Americans; Forces polluters to pay for emergency cleanups and hazardous waste sites, it reestablishes some of Americaâ€™s credibility on climate in the international community, AND it pays for itself by taxing corporations. This is a hot bill.
