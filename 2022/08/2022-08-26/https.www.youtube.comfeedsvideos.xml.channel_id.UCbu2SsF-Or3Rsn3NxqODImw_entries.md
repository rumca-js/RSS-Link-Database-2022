Red Dead Redemption 2, the prequel to Rockstar's beloved Red Dead Redemption, features a number of brand new faces - like Arthur Morgan, and plenty of familiar ones - like fan favorite John Marston. Red Dead 2 has become notable for its compelling characters and incredible story it weaves.

## Nintendo Won't Raise the Price of the Switch | GameSpot News

Sony's increasing the price of the PS5 in some regions, but Nintendo is firm it won't do the same for the Switch. Despite a rumor, Amazon is reportedly not buying EA; and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gets an all new trailer.

Speaking to Eurogamer, Nintendo's president said in a statement: "we will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations," and do not have any plans to "increase the trade price of its hardware." Instead, Nintendo is decreasing the size of Switch packaging to help with shipping issues, by making the cardboard box it comes in 20% smaller, which in turn will help the company's bottom line by using fewer materials. 

Early this morning a report suggested that Amazon was set to announce an acquisition of Electronic Arts later today. However, it didn't take long for the report to be denied. After all, EA is reportedly pursuing a sale or merger, and is said to have had talks with Disney, Apple, Comcast, and, of course, Amazon. But as of now, there is no official news to report on of the behemoth developer/publisher being purchased at this time. 

Souls-like fans have been eating well recently, because today we got a trailer for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a new Souls-like action game from Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, and Stranger of Paradise developer Team Ninja. The trailer is filled with sword fighting, Chinese martial arts, and otherworldly enemies and environments players will be exploring. 

Here's your friendly reminder that Destiny 2 and all its expansions are free to play until August 30. So if you've always been curious, now's a good time to dip your toes in.

## The Playstation 5 Gets a Price Increase | GameSpot News

The Playstation 5 gets a price increase, Lies of P gets a new gameplay trailer, and Battlefield 2042 gets a Season 2 update.

Sony Interactive Entertainment is increasing the price of the PlayStation 5 across various regions, citing global economic challenges and adverse currency trends as the primary reason. Sony Interactive Entertainment’s CEO Jim Ryan stated in a blog post that the price increase is going to affect all of Europe, the UK, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and parts of North America. Due to the current strength of the dollar, The United States will not be affected by the change.

Lies of P, the newest entry in the Soulsborne genre got a 6 minute gameplay trailer today after being shown off at Opening Night Live. The gameplay looks to emulate that feeling directly with attacks and parries that also incorporate Pinocchio’s mechanical arm to shock or grapple enemies. Swords, hammers, and shields are your primary tools for bashing baddies. Developer Neowiz has not set a hard and fast release date yet, but expect to explore the desolate world of Lies of P in early 2023.

EA and DICE have announced the first details on Battlefield 2042 Season 2. The sophomore season is called Master of Arms, and it's set for release on August 30 on all platforms. The new map, Stranded, players will fight for control of the ship, and can go inside it for close-quarters combat. We're also seeing the addition of a healer and support specialist who can revive and refill their gadgets. He also has a minigun. Additionally, Battlefield 2042 introduces a new feature called Assignments, which are progression tracks that allow players to unlock more weapons that were previously available only in Battlefield Portal.
