Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. The @NovationTV Circuit Tracks is the brain and sequencer. I'm using the @Yamaha_Global Reface CP for the intro.
The repeating 2 note pattern is the Circuit's internal Synth 2. The bass is using internal Synth 1. The drums use Drum Tracks 1-4 (kick, stick, hats, snare/clap). The 2 MIDI tracks are being used to control the @Arturia Microfreak and the @RolandChannel JU-06. I use Scenes on the Circuit to go from one section to another
For guitars I use a Joyo American Sound for amp and @TC Electronic Echobrain for delay.
For looping the CP I use a @Singular Sound Aeros Loop Studio, with a @Disaster Area Designs Midi Baby on the floor to trigger a loop record and to trigger playbank when the loop recording is done.
Recorded as stereo (Circuit) and multitracks (guitar loop and solo) into a Zoom H5 and mastered in Logic Pro X (some eq and reverb and compression).
