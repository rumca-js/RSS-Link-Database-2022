While Resident Evil 1 completely revolutionized the industry and coined the term: "Survival Horror", Resident Evil 4 was able to, yet again, revolutionize the industry with its unique blend of Action Horror. Since RE4 has come out, it has served as a major influence on games like: Dead Space, Gears of War, God of War, and even The Last of Us.

Join The Sphere Hunter, Residence of Evil, Caddicarus, The Completionist, Ink Ribbon, DaveControl, and GameSpot's very own Chris Morris, Kurt Indovina, and Jean-Luc Seipke as they discuss just the industry changing Resident Evil 4, and how much they absolutely adored the game.

JJ of Residence of Evil, DaveControl, and The Completionist discuss how different Las Plagas and the Ganados were compared to zombies, while Kurt also points out just how much the over-shoulder camera made a difference to the feel of the game.

The Sphere Hunter gushes about her love for Leon S. Kennedy, while also discussing some of the more terrifying bosses like U-3. Bosses like El Gigante and Del Lago are also brought up, while Caddicarus talks about some of the more stressful moments - like being trapped in a house with Luis.

And - speaking of characters, everyone had plenty to say about Ashley. From her constant screams of "Leon", to how terrifying it can actually be to play as her, bringing the game right back into survival horror territory.

Here is everything you need to know about Gamecom Opening Night Live.
#GamingNews #onl 

A few weeks after hitting us with Summer Game Fest and its many world premieres, Geoff Keighley is back to host Opening Night Live. This event kicks off the annual European gaming convention Gamescom and Geoff has already teased 30+ games will be shown off. Opening Night Live 2022 will be the first live in-person ONL presentation since 2019, following two years of online-only livestreams. Tickets are available for those attending Gamescom in Cologne, Germany at the event's official website.

However, for those of us that can’t make the trip to Germany, there is still the option to watch it on one of the expensive screens we all own. Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022 will be available right here on GameSpot’s YouTube and Twitch channel. The stream begins Tuesday, August 23 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET and according to Geoff, the showcase will run for about two hours so make sure you have plenty of snacks and plenty of water. You don’t want to be dehydrated when your next favorite game gets announced.

The list of what's been confirmed for the show so far includes a "brand-new sci-fi IP" from Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment
The Callisto Protocol, Goat Simulator 3, High On Life, Hogwarts Legacy, Return to Monkey Island, and Sonic Frontiers.

Last year's Opening Night Live event included the debut of the new Saints Row and Marvel's Midnight Suns, as well as gameplay from Call of Duty Vanguard's campaign and Death Stranding: Director's Cut.
