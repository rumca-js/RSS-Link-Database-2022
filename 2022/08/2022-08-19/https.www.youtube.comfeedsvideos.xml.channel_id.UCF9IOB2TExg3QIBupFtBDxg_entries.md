Bivalent new vaccine, Moderna press release

https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Announces-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Superior-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron/default.aspx


Omicron-containing bivalent COVID booster candidate, mRNA-1273.214

(original mRNA-1273 vaccine),

Superior neutralizing antibody response

in baseline seronegative participants. 

increased neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMT) against Omicron approximately 8-fold above baseline levels. 

mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose, well-tolerated in the 437 study participants

The safety and reactogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose was similar to that of mRNA-1273 50 μg

Epidemiology of Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following mRNA Vaccination by Vaccine Product, Schedule, and Interdose Interval Among Adolescents and Adults in Ontario, Canada

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2793551

Population-based cohort study of 297 individuals in Ontario, Canada,

with myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination,

found higher rates of myocarditis or pericarditis associated with receipt of mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 as a second dose, 

particularly among male individuals aged 18 to 24 years. 

The results suggest that there may be product-specific differences in rates of myocarditis or pericarditis after receiving mRNA vaccines

First bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine approved by UK medicines regulator

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-vaccine-approved-by-uk-medicines-regulator

Moderna bivalent approved for adult booster doses by MHRA

Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron

25 micrograms targets the original virus strain

25 micrograms targets Omicron

Omicron (BA.1) and the original 2020 strain

(was also found to generate a good immune response against BA.4 and BA.5)

Safety monitoring

side effects observed were the same as those seen for the original Moderna booster dose,

and were typically mild and self-resolving, 

and no serious safety concerns were identified.

Global covid deaths

Evidence cited by HMRA

Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, 

we estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million deaths from COVID-19 in 185 countries,

between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. 

19·8 million when we used excess deaths as an estimate

JCVI advises

the following groups should be offered a COVID-19 booster vaccine:

residents in a care home for older adults and staff working in care homes for older adults

frontline health and social care workers

all adults aged 50 years and over

persons aged 5 to 49 years in a clinical risk group
 
persons aged 5 to 49 years who are household contacts of people with immunosuppression

persons aged 16 to 49 years who are carers
