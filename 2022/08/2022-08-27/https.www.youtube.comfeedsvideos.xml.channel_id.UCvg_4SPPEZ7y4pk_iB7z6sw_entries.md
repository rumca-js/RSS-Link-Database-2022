Saints Row, 2022, is a video game, released in 2022. That is likely how it will always be remembered.

Who needs the old games, they were old, this is new, so its better!

I mean, it doesn’t have amazing reviews, and this isn’t really a review.

If I gave this game a review score, I’d give it a score out of 10. Which integer I’d select? Who knows.

This game is arguably the only reason you need to buy an Xbox Series X, PS5, or build any fancy high end rig. It’s more than a game, it’s an experience.
