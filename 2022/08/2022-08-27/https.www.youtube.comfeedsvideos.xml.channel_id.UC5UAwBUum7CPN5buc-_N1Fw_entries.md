#linux #laptop #review

It is undeniably a beautiful laptop. It's 35 centimeters in length, 24 in depth, and it's 2cm thick at its highest point, and it's really light, at 1.5 kilos only.

The chassis is magnesium and not aluminium: it's not as solid, but it's also super light, and in my experience, it's very durable.

The hinge is very sturdy, and doesn't wobble at all when you're typing, and you can open it with one finger. Solidity wise, it feels very well built. It doesn't creak, it doesn't bend, and the deck flex is limited to a minimum.

You can open it up by removing the bottom panel with a few standard screws, and upgrade the RAM and the storage.

The Executive 16 has only one CPU option, the core i7, 12 700H. It's a 14 core, 20 threads, 12th gen intel CPU. Coupled with that is an 82 Wh battery, and an Nvidia RTX 3050Ti dedicated GPU.

Now, the only choices you can make is the ram, from 16Gb to 64, the storage, from one 500GB SSD to 2 modules of 2 terabytes, if you want these in RAID, and the keyboard layout.

By default, you'll get 16 Gigs of RAM, and 500GB of SSD, but my review unit came with 64GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD.


Now, for the I/O, on the left, you have a USB C port, it's 3.2 Gen 2, supports displayport 1.4, and can charge the laptop. We also have a USB A 3.2 Gen 1, a full size SD Card slot, and a headphone ad mic combo jack. On the right, we have a DC barrel charger, an HDMI 2.0 port, another USB A port, 3.2 Gen 1, and a THunderbolt 4 port, which also supports charging, of course.

The Executive 16 also has WIfi 6, from Intel, and Bluetooth 5.1.

It's 16 inch, it's a 16:10 aspect ratio, which I know some of you love, it's 90hz refresh rate, and it's 2560 by 1600, so what they call 3K, but it's basically 1440p, but a bit taller to work with the aspect ratio.

It's 400 nits, and it has an anti glare coating, contrast ratio is 1500:1.

Bezels are minimal, which I like.

On top of the display, you have 2 webcams. The first one is an infrared, that lets you unlock your computer with your face, the second webcam is a regular 1080p one, and it's decent.

It's joined by a mic that can only be qualified as decent, IF you lower the gain a lot.

THe speakers, on the other hand, are pretty good.

On to the keyboard, then. This thing has a numpad. The keyboard here is large, well spaced, which means mistypes are very unlikely to happen. It's decently clicky, with a sound that I find quite pleasing.

The keys don't have much key travel though, think pre-butterfly keyboard macbooks. The press does feel pretty good though, quite bouncy, not too hard at the end of the key press, you don't feel like you're typing on a hard surface or on glass.

The touchpad is glass, super smooth, and it's the biggest touchpad I've ever seen. Seriously, it's the size of the screen of my Steam Deck. It's very precise and the click sound is really soft and nice, it feels solid.

The i7 12700H is a beast, there's no 2 ways about it. With a single core score of 1860 and multi core of 10858, in geekbench 5, it's comparable to my desktop ryzen 5 5800H.

As per the battery life, running youtube videos in a loop netted me 4h and 30 minutes, and using it in a more real life scenario, it lasted for 7 hours, in hybrid graphics mode. And if you go into intel only, and get the refresh rate down to 60hz, you can gain an extra hour and a half.
