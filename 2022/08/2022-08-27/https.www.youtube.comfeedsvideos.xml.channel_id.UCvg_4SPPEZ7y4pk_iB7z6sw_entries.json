That is likely how it will always be remembered.\n\nWho needs the old games, they were old, this is new, so its better!\n\nI mean, it doesn\u2019t have amazing reviews, and this isn\u2019t really a review.\n\nIf I gave this game a review score, I\u2019d give it a score out of 10. Which integer I\u2019d select? Who knows.\n\nThis game is arguably the only reason you need to buy an Xbox Series X, PS5, or build any fancy high end rig. It\u2019s more than a game, it\u2019s an experience.\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRlYcCUR-1s", "date_published": "2022-08-27 19:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
