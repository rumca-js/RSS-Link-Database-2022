While Resident Evil 1 completely revolutionized the industry and coined the term: "Survival Horror", Resident Evil 4 was able to, yet again, revolutionize the industry with its unique blend of Action Horror. Since RE4 has come out, it has served as a major influence on games like: Dead Space, Gears of War, God of War, and even The Last of Us.

Join The Sphere Hunter, Residence of Evil, Caddicarus, The Completionist, Ink Ribbon, DaveControl, and GameSpot's very own Chris Morris, Kurt Indovina, and Jean-Luc Seipke as they discuss just the industry changing Resident Evil 4, and how much they absolutely adored the game.

JJ of Residence of Evil, DaveControl, and The Completionist discuss how different Las Plagas and the Ganados were compared to zombies, while Kurt also points out just how much the over-shoulder camera made a difference to the feel of the game.

The Sphere Hunter gushes about her love for Leon S. Kennedy, while also discussing some of the more terrifying bosses like U-3. Bosses like El Gigante and Del Lago are also brought up, while Caddicarus talks about some of the more stressful moments - like being trapped in a house with Luis.

And - speaking of characters, everyone had plenty to say about Ashley. From her constant screams of "Leon", to how terrifying it can actually be to play as her, bringing the game right back into survival horror territory.

## GTA 6 DLC Plan Sounds Great… If It's True | GameSpot News

GTA 6 could be heading back to single-player DLC and Diablo 4 is promising it won’t be pay-to-win.

Known GTA tipster Tez2 shared new rumors in a post on GTAForums in response to a comment about the reports of the world of GTA 6 "expanding over time." Tez2 said this means "Rockstar will go back to how they were planning future content before GTA Online success boomed."
In other words, Rockstar was allegedly working on single-player DLC for Grand Theft Auto V but the studio ended these projects and shifted its focus to GTA Online.

In a since deleted tweet, Tez2 urged Online players to dial 505-555-0175 in-game for “the first hint of GTA 6”. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Twitter user NoughtAFazeMom, the number simply leads to hold music. Which ironically fits the situation we’re all in anyway as we sit around on hold, waiting for Rockstar to drop a trailer or an information filled blog post.

The Saints Row series is back and looking to reinvent itself. Instead of picking up where part 4 left off, this new entry is taking you back to the beginning with an all new cast of characters causing mayhem in a brand new city. Here is everything you need to know about Saints Row.
#Gaming #saintsrow 

Similar to the rest of the series, Saints Row is being developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. With this opportunity to start over, series developer Volition wanted to create criminals that were more relatable and one way of doing that was to show those goons starting from nothing. Each of the new criminals are just trying to make ends meet and head out on their own because they are tired of working for other gangs. Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west. 

Saints Row’s new cast of characters include: the business mastermind Eli, who cares more about making the money than how the money is made. The getaway driver, Neenah, who is a member of the muscle car and exercise obsessed Los Panteros. As well as the people-pleaser Kevin, who is a member of the anarchist nightclub owners known as the Idols. 

Saints Row is scheduled to launch on August 23, 2022. The game was originally set to release on February 25 before being delayed so that the team could do a little bit more fine tuning. The game will be released for both current and past generation consoles, as well as PC.
