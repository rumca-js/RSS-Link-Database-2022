JE Sunde is - no exaggeration - one of my favorite songwriters. His record “9 Songs About Love” gets played on loop here. We recorded a few original tunes together last month. This first one is called “Blue Light” and you can listen to it in all the places.

LYRICS
Blue light of morning
Icetray overflowing
There’s blood on the ground
I think crazy thoughts when I’m angry
I’ll burn it all down

No one ever needed
Anyone like I need you
Well I know it’s not true 
But I want you to stay
So I say it anyway

Well I met you dancin’
To some Townes Van Zandt song
You knew all the words
And you took me driving 
Deep in the canyons
Huggin’ the curves
No one ever needed
Anyone like I need you
Well I know it’s not true
But I want you to stay
So I say it anyway

Ooooo

Blue light of morning
I'm sorry I swore we would both make it out 
My head held tight to a story I liked
and was dreaming about
No one ever needed
No one ever needed
Anyone like I need you
I know it’s not true
But I want you to stay
So I say it anyway
