\n\nPfizer and Flynn charged unfairly high prices for capsules,\n\nfor over 4 years, \n\nultimately paid for by the NHS.\n\nFirms de-branded the drug, previously known as Epanutin, \n\nmeaning it was no longer subject to price regulation \n\nand the firms could set prices at their discretion. \n\nPfizer and Flynn were the dominant suppliers of the drug in the UK at the time, \n\nthe NHS had no choice but to pay the inflated final price for this.\n\nOver the 4 years\n\nPfizer charged prices between 780% and 1,600% higher than previously. \n\nThe company supplied the drug to Flynn, which then sold the capsules on to wholesalers and pharmacies at a price between 2,300% and 2,600% higher than the prices previously charged by Pfizer. \n\nThis illegal behaviour led to NHS annual costs for phenytoin capsules increasing from \u00a32 million in 2012 to approximately \u00a350 million the following year.\n\nAndrea Coscelli, Chief Executive CMA, Competition and Markets Authority \n\nPhenytoin is an essential drug relied on daily by thousands of people throughout the UK\n\nto prevent life-threatening epileptic seizures. \n\nThese firms illegally exploited their dominant positions to charge the NHS excessive prices and make more money for themselves \u2013 \n\nmeaning patients and taxpayers lost out.\n\nSuch behaviour will not be tolerated, and the companies must now face the consequences of their illegal action.\n\nPharma Companies Fined \u00a370 Million for Overcharging the
