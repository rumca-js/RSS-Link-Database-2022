Privacy tools are inconsistent. The inventory of recommended countermeasures changes all the time. On the long enough timeline, you canâ€™t trust any single product. So what if instead of focusing on the tools, you would learn a consistent method that would help you proactively mitigate privacy threats as they arise? 

This is exactly what this guide aims to give you. It will introduce you to a tested methodology with which you will be able to achieve strong privacy. The secret is to start with a threat model. For our threat modeling exercise, we will use LINDDUN Go cards to help us elicit and mitigate all the threats we could face in our time.
