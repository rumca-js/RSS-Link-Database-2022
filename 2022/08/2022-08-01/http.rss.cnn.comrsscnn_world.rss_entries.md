British actor Sienna Miller is no newcomer to the countryside. In fact, she bought her idyllic rural bolthole over a decade ago. The purchase came after Miller's big industry breaks "Alfie" (2004) and "Layer Cake" (2004); a brief but highly publicized relationship with co-star Jude Law and her subsequent anointment as one of the "It Girl"s of noughties London. "It was a time when there was a lot of press attention on me, and I wanted somewhere to escape," explained Miller, in an exclusive interview with Architectural Digest for its annual September Style issue. "I bought the house on a whim -- it offers a sanctuary. I also wanted somewhere where family and friends could gather. It has a nurturing feeling; it is a home with a heart," said the cover star.
