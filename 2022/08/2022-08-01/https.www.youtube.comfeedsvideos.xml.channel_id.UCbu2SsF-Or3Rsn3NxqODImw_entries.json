Treyarch is leading the next mainline game, which was delayed to 2024, as Bloomberg reported earlier this year.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II is scheduled to launch on October 28 and will likely increase engagement in the series.

Version 1.2 of the game includes bug fixes, balance changes and quality of life improvements.

According to those documents, Sony believes that once Microsoft owns the Call of Duty franchise as part of the acquisition, it'll have the power to influence users' console choices.\n\nThe funny thing about this is that PlayStation has been using Call of Duty to influence player console choice for years now by having exclusive and/or early access to content. For example, 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare launched with a co-op spec ops survival mode as a PS4 exclusive feature.   \n\nIn other PlayStation news, Sony is doing away with PS5's accolades this fall. Accolades was a launch feature on PS5, and players could give medals like helpful, welcoming, and good sport to others in multiplayer games. In theory, Sony implemented the accolades system to reduce toxicity. But in practice, nobody really knew that this system existed, to say nothing of actually using it--a fact Sony acknowledged in the discontinuation announcement.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company has announced that a new Pok\u00e9mon Presents will be streamed on August 3 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on its YouTube channel. The next games in the series, Scarlet and Violet, will be the main event for this week's presentation, and it's likely that the video will have a few more pocket monsters to reveal. As for the other games that will be shown at Wednesday\u2019s stream, there's a whole lot of Pok\u00e9mon projects currently active, ranging from mobile games Pok\u00e9mon Unite to Pok\u00e9mon Masters, as well as apps for the franchise such as Pok\u00e9mon Home.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:07 - Call of Duty\n01:30 - PS5 Feature\n02:10 - Pok\u00e9mon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFGCml3PZA", "date_published": "2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
