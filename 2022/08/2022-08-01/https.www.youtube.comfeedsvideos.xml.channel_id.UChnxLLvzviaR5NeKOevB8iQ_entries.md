The Bastl Softpop 2 can definitely be said to be a synthesizer. I checked the manual and it confirmed this. If anyone tells you it's not a synthesizer, don't listen to them. They're wrong and they're lying to you. I'm so tired. I don't even like doing this anymore. I want to sleep until I don't have to worry about anything anymore. YouTube takes what you love, makes it a job, and then makes you hate it. I'm not going to check the analytics for this video. I never do, anyways. I'm throwing away my phone and my computer.

Also, there are hands. Here they are: https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/softpop2
