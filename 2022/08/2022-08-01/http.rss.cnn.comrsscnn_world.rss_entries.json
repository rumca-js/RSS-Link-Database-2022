In fact, she bought her idyllic rural bolthole over a decade ago. The purchase came after Miller's big industry breaks \"Alfie\" (2004) and \"Layer Cake\" (2004); a brief but highly publicized relationship with co-star Jude Law and her subsequent anointment as one of the \"It Girl\"s of noughties London. \"It was a time when there was a lot of press attention on me, and I wanted somewhere to escape,\" explained Miller, in an exclusive interview with Architectural Digest for its annual September Style issue. \"I bought the house on a whim -- it offers a sanctuary. I also wanted somewhere where family and friends could gather. It has a nurturing feeling; it is a home with a heart,\" said the cover star.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sienna-miller-country-house-tour-architectural-digest/index.html", "date_published": "2022-08-01 11:59:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
