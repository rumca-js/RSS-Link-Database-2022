Phil Spencer feels good about the Activision Blizzard Acquisition, Dead Island 2 finally gets a gameplay trailer, and Masahiro Sakurai Starts a Youtube Channel. 

Phil Spencer is confident that the Activision Blizzard deal will go through while he waits for approval from a panel of countries. Playstation raised concerns about Microsoft having too much exclusivity on IPS. Phil Spencer also mentioned to Bloomberg that it's "something we're just going to see less and less of", and believes console exclusives have been fading for some time now. This comes as more and more Sony exclusive games head to PC and Game Pass.

Dead Island 2 got a gameplay trailer for the first time in years, showing off some gore filled moments with a hands on experience in person during GamesCom. The game is expected to launch on February 3rd, 2023.

Super Smash Bros creator Masahiro Sakurai is starting a YouTube channel on game design, appropriately called Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games. He detailed his vision to create bite-size videos about a range of topics in video game design, with an emphasis on classic games.

Splatoon 3 takes everything Nintendo learned from two games and a large-scale expansion and then adds even more to make a robust, ink-soaked package.
#splatoon3 #gamespot #nintendo 

Splatoon 3 looks to be the most robust Splatoon package yet. At a hands-on event, we tried three distinct modes that show the breadth of the content offerings in Splatoon 3: the single-player Return of the Mammalians campaign, the cooperative wave-based Salmon Run, and the traditional competitive Turf War battles. The underlying mechanics still feel as great as ever, but now there's just way more to do with them.
