Elden Ring gets a substantial patch, a new Xbox Elite controller is on its way, and Skyrim gets a Nemesis System.
#Gaming #EldenRing #Xbox 

Elden Ring is getting some of its biggest changes yet, a new Xbox Elite controller could be coming soon, and Skyrim gets a fun mod. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

A new patch for Elden Ring, 1.06, is now live, and it brings with it some massive adjustments. Previously in the game, you could only put down one summon sign at a time. Even leaving an area would be enough to stop the summon sign from functioning. With this newest patch, players can place multiple summon signs and invade larger areas. This means that it will be easier to pick up some PvP or run around the world while waiting to get summoned for a boss. 

The oft-used and oft-maligned ash of war Bloodstone Step has been nerfed, with decreased distance and fewer invincibility frames, as well as growing less effective with repeated use. 

Another notorious skill, Corpse Piler, now has decreased damage and blood buildup when hit with the blood portion of the attack. Damage caused by hitting enemies with the blade itself has only been slightly decreased. 

Other changes make Greatswords, Curved Greatswords, and Great Hammers quicker and an increased roll distance with a light equip load. The patch also fixes dozens of bugs and will now warn players if they are in possession of an unauthorized item such as Deathbed Smalls aka Fia’s underwear. Earlier this year a player ironically named Pantsu Dealer invaded worlds and left the cursed item behind for unsuspecting players to pick up. This resulted in tons of 180-day ban reports from users on Elden Ring’s subreddit. At least now you’ll know ahead of time to toss them because the ban hammer is dropped.  

The community response to the patch, thus far, has been overwhelmingly positive. Quote tweets and comments abound rejoice at the implemented nerfs and even the buffs to larger and heavier weapons.

Modern Warfare 2 beta info drops, we might be getting a new Tekken game, and Platoon 3 is getting a Nintendo direct.
#Gaming #ModernWarfare2 #CallOfDuty

A flood of new Call of Duty info, some exciting fighting game surprises, and more on today’s GameSpot News.

At this past weekend’s Call of Duty League World Championships - ‘grats LA Thieves - Infinity Ward announced dates for the Modern Warfare 2’s upcoming beta. 

The beta will start on September 16th and 17th for PlayStation players via early access. Anyone on that platform that preorders the game, received a beta code during the world championship event, or receives them via online giveaways from Activision or partnered streamers, will have access at this time. On the 18th through the 20th of September, the beta becomes open to all PlayStation players.

Gamers on Xbox and PC can jump into their own early access period on September 22nd and 23rd, with the beta becoming available to all players on every platform September 24th through 26th. That means if you’re playing in early access on PlayStation, you have a full ten days of beta to sink your teeth into.

No modes were confirmed for the beta, but a new map, Marina Grand Prix, which looks to take place on a Formula 1 race track, was shown off and will be playable in September. We’re also hoping to see if Battle Maps will make an appearance which are COD MW 2’s larger scale modes including Ground War. 

But that’s not all! Right before the beta kicks off, on September 15th, a Call of Duty Next event will take place. This will be when you will get your first real look at Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, Activision’s next iteration of Warzone, as well as a taste of Warzone for mobile. Yes, Call of Duty currently has a very popular mobile title, that does already include a battle royale mode, but it is something more akin to the BR that was packed in with Black Ops 4 Blackout than the much more popular, stand alone Warzone. 

Ok, was that enough Call of Duty for you? I think that was enough Call of Duty for you. How about some Tekken?

TIME CODES: 
00:09 - Modern Warfare 2
01:54 - Tekken
02:57 - Splatoon 3
