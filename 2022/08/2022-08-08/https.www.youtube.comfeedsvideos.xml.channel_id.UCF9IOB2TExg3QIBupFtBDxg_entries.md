And how to protect yourself and family

Existential threat to Europe

Strikes close to a storage facility for spent fuel

Iodine-127, good

Iodine-131, very radioactive 

Iodine-131 (half life 8 days)

Caesium-137  (half life 20 years)

Uranium 235 (reactor-grade uranium), half life 700 million years

Largest nuclear power plant in Europe, 6 reactors, at Zaporizhzhia

https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident.aspx

Chernobyl 4 reactor accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel.

The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the environment, 

Reactor core had 192 tonnes of fuel,
with the deposition of radioactive materials in many parts of Europe.

Some 350,000 people were evacuated as a result of the accident

Five million people lived in areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine 
contaminated

A total of 29,400 km2 was contaminated above 180 kBq/m2.

Some 20,000 to 600,000 liquidators irradiated

On 24 February Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces had taken control of all facilities at Chernobyl 

On 9 March the Chernobyl nuclear plant was disconnected from the electricity grid.

Update 88 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine

https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-88-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine

Ukraine’s Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP)

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needs to send a mission

IAEA has received information about shelling near the spent fuel storage facility.

Friday’s events had breached several of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars

Pillar 1 (Physical integrity)

Pillar 2 (All safety and security systems and equipment must be functional at all times)

Pillar 3 (Operating Staff)

Pillar 4 (Power supply)

Pillar 6 (Radiation monitoring and Emergency Preparedness and Response arrangements)

Director General Grossi Alarmed by Shelling at Ukraine NPP, says IAEA Mission Vital for Nuclear Safety and Security

https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/director-general-grossi-alarmed-by-shelling-at-ukraine-npp-says-iaea-mission-vital-for-nuclear-safety-and-security

Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

Rafael Mariano Grossi

I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in 

Ukraine and beyond.

Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

This must stop and stop now.

I have been ready to lead a mission of IAEA safety, security and safeguards experts to the country’s biggest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzya.

We can’t afford to lose any more time.

Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general

end to the suicidal military operations around the plant

Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous

Monkeypox, declared a public health emergency as the U.S.

US, CDC

https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html

Confirmed cases, 7,510

Monkeypox symptoms

Rash that may be located on or near the genitals or anus

could be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth.

Rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing

Rash can initially look like pimples or blisters, may be painful or itchy.

Other symptoms can include

Fever

Chills

Swollen lymph nodes

Exhaustion

Muscle aches and backache

Headache

Respiratory symptoms (e.g. sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough)

You may experience all or only a few symptoms

Sometimes, people have flu-like symptoms before the rash.

Some people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms.

Others only experience a rash.

Over the past couple of weeks there has been approximately no change in the daily number of confirmed cases.

Ascertainment

Testing is freely available,

it is likely that there is under ascertainment

Atypical symptoms, single or scarce lesions, international reports of subclinical infection

Level 2 is defined as transmission within a defined sub-population, currently gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM) connected by sexual networks. 

Data does not suggest a change in case mix (703 out of 2,638)

22 women with confirmed or highly probable monkeypox in England

No robust evidence of sustained transmission outside some sexual networks of GBMSM

Route of transmission

Primary reported route is through close or sexual contact, 

monkeypox virus has been detected in air and environmental samples in the hospital room of infected patients. 

No confirmed instances of airborne transmission

Limited household transmission has been described in the UK

Small numbers with no known route of acquisition, (due to no sex or other potential exposures during incubation period)

Assessment (confidence): transmitting primarily through close or sexual contact (moderate).

Observed clinical severity

No reported deaths in the UK

Significant morbidity, severe pain, secondary bacterial infection

Virological characterisation

UK genomic data is now available. 

Mostly distinct lineage B.1

Has 61 mutations of unknown significance

Two UK cases and some international cases, lineage A.2 

No clear-cut evidence of adaptation for improved human transmission. 

Assessment (confidence): insufficient data.

Without urgent action, we risk monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK. 

GBMSM, Messaging must reach communities at high risk of acquiring monkeypox, through targeted messaging on apps, online and in the queer media.
 
Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK. 

two doses to 125,000 people

asking that the government treat the monkeypox outbreak as a public health emergency

Luckily, we have the tools required to stop this outbreak and prevent further risk to health now. 

We ask that you do so urgently.
