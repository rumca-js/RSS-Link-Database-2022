In this video we break down everything players need to know including some new gameplay mechanics like Fieldsense, as well as changes to the classic Franchise mode.\n\nThe year is 2022, which means we are yet again receiving another Madden game to start the football season. For those of you thinking this might just be yet another Madden\u2026well, you're probably right, but hey, you know, and I know the real reason we keep coming back for more: Roster Updates. All jokes aside stick around as I break down everything to know about Madden 23, so you can see if this might be the Madden for you.\n\nMadden 23's biggest change to the core gameplay is what EA is calling Fieldsense, an overhaul to several of the game's on-field mechanics. New tackle animations and game logic have redressed the play-by-play nature of the sport. punchout fumbles and more team gang tackles intend to bring an extra level of oomph and aggression to the game \u2013 something EA refers to as the Hit Everything feature.\n\nWe're gonna have lots of Madden coverage coming this month. I'm working on getting a Livestream set up for you guys the week the game comes out. Be sure to keep an eye out for Mark Delaney's official Madden review after the game launches as well.

Sony told us up front that they are still working on optimization and warned us about certain issues they plan to fix. In fact we got a big fat update just a few days before this video launched, offering some major improvements So it's possible some of the issues we talk about will be improved down the line in future patches.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered is out now on PC. The port includes ultrawide support, an unlocked frame rate, improved shadows, ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), Nvidia Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA) and more.

The new game is a third-person title that reimagines the original game, making adjustments to its story and gameplay, while attempting to capture the suspense and atmosphere that made Alone in the Dark so memorable.\n\nTHQ announced the return of Alone in the Dark during its 2022 game showcase, in which it showed off a trailer that gives a sense of the expanded, more cinematic version of the tale the reboot will tell. GameSpot got an expanded look at the game, which included an explanation of its story, setting, characters, and gameplay. Like the original Alone in the Dark, the reboot is largely set in a mansion called Derceto Manor in the 1920s American South. This time, however, it's not a mansion, but a mental hospital for rich clients--and the game will include additional settings, as well.\n\nAlso returning from the original are Alone in the Dark's playable characters, Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood. Both are playable in the new game, and both play a larger part in the other character's story. In fact, like in later survival horror games such as Resident Evil 2, the stories experienced by Edward and Emily are different from one another, taking you through a different tale depending on which you choose.\n\nAlone in the Dark is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but THQ Nordic hasn't yet announced a release date.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Vrrl0CdV4", "date_published": "2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Alone In The Dark Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "Make your way back to Derceto Manor in this reimagination of Alone in the Dark.

Instead of covering a city, Wreckreation takes place in its own drivable state, made up of four different counties that you can explore to discover shortcuts, challenges, and breakable billboards. There are 400 square kilometers of area in the game, and you can drive on all of it, according to Three Fields.\nFor more information on all the announcements made during today\u2019s presentation, head to GameSpot dot com.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxCtqbvM0gc", "date_published": "2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake Official Trailer", "description": "SpongeBob and his buddy Balloon-Patrick are ready for a new adventure! \n\nTravel to the Prehistoric Kelp Forest, Wild West Jellyfish Fields and more in this new trailer for SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake! \n\nSpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.\n\n#spongebob #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xWuMjxw8kk", "date_published": "2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 Livestream", "description": "Tune in for the second annual THQ Nordic Digital Showcase featuring a look at games like SpongeBob, Destroy All Humans! 2, Outcast 2, Jagged Alliance 3, and new announcements and surprises.\r\n\r\n#thqnordic #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdWS5VIdwXE", "date_published": "2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Completionist, Exclusive God of Work Clip, and Fancasting Our Own Sitcom | After Dark Ep 157", "description": "We are joined by Jirard \"The Completionist\" Khalil to talk about his new show at G4, God of Work.
