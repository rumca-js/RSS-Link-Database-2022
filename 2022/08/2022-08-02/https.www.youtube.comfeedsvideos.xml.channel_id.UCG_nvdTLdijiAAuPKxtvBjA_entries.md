The Gray Man is Netflix's new Bournelike action movie from the directors of Captain America and Avengers, starring Captain America Chris Evans and robot Ryan Gosling. Whether the movie overall is good or not is up for debate but as an action movie it is definitely an improvement over The 355, which tried and failed hard at the same earlier in 2022 as discussed in the video "The 355 - Why Hollywood's Female Action Films Flop". So today, let's compare the Gray Man to the action weaknesses of The 355 and see how it improves upon them.

Directed by Simon Kinberg, this spy thriller features Mace (Jessica Chastain), a wildcard type of CIA agent who decides to join forces with other spies to retrieve a top-secret weapon stolen by mercenaries planning to unleash global trouble. Since the weapon involves cyberspace knowhow, Mace convinces former MI6 British agent Khadijah (Lupita Nyong’o) to help since she’s a computer specialist. She also recruits Colombian psychologist Graciela (Penélope Cruz) and even a rival agent from Germany named Marie (Diane Kruger) to join the espionage team.
