Call of Duty insiders have long suggested the existence of DMZ, which is said to be Modern Warfare 2's extraction-based mode inspired by Escape from Tarkov. The leaks describe DMZ as an open-world mode with a mix of battle royale and survival game elements, and the mode has reportedly been in development for four years.\n\nToday the Pokemon Company revealed more details about its November games, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The game takes place in the Paldea region, which players will travel across using the two legendary Pokemon Koraidon and Miraidon. The new trailer also shows off how versatile the new legendaries are; both can be used for travel by air, land and sea. The story centers on a Pokemon academy, where the main character is a student who sets out to explore the world.\n\nBut that's not all, because we also learned about Scarlet and Violet\u2019s new gameplay mechanic, Terastallize, which transforms a pocket monster into a crystal version of itself with boosted stats. Each Pokemon in the Paldea region gets a unique gem-like look when subjected to Terastallizing, and some Pokemon will change type as well. According to the Pokemon Company, there are 18 types that form a wide number of combinations of Pokemon and Tera Types, and players can Terastallize a Pokemon once per battle.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:07 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:53 - Pokemon Scarlet & Violet", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXyK6enUA5g", "date_published": "2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Presents Full Presentation (08.03.2022)", "description": "Checkout the full Pok\u00e9mon Presents for August 3rd, 2022 with updates on Pok\u00e9mon apps and video games, including Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Pok\u00e9mon Violet!\n\n#Poke\u0301mon #pokemonscarlet #pokemonviolet\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:21 - Pok\u00e9mon World Championships 2022\n03:00 - Pok\u00e9mon GO FEST 2022\n04:42 - Pok\u00e9mon Unite\n06:22 - Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX\n07:12 - Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 Remix\n09:13 - Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0MCwBgtBg", "date_published": "2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Pok\u00e9mon Violet - World Overview Gameplay Presentation", "description": "#Poke\u0301mon #pokemonscarlet #pokemonviolet\n\nNintendo revealed more info about Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, featuring a new region called Paldea and a spooky occurrence named Terastallization.
