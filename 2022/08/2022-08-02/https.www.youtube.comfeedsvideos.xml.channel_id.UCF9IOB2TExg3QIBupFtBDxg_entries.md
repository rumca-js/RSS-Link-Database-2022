takes the necessary steps if required.

Reporting suspected cases of adverse effects is a central pillar for being able to judge the safety of medicines. 

New signals can be detected in a timely manner, 

and the risk/benefit profile of vaccines can be continuously monitored. 

Even reactions with a timely relation to a vaccine do not necessarily have a causal relation.
