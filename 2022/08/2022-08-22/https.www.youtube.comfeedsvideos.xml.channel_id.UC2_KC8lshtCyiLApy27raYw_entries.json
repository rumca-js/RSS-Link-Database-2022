Is it good? Probably not. Bad? Who knows. I don\u2019t. Streaming is fascinating to me. Because, I watch a lot of it. That\u2019s my defining personality trait. I watch TV. \n\nI mean, I\u2019m just talking about streaming stuff. What could happen? Who knows! Wait I already said that in this description. I guess I just don\u2019t know.\n\nBut yeah that HBO Max stuff, that\u2019ll have to wait. I\u2019ll be working on it probably as soon as you see this video.
