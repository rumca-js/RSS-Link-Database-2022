Netflix. Disney Plus. Something else. Is it good? Probably not. Bad? Who knows. I don’t. Streaming is fascinating to me. Because, I watch a lot of it. That’s my defining personality trait. I watch TV. 

I mean, I’m just talking about streaming stuff. What could happen? Who knows! Wait I already said that in this description. I guess I just don’t know.

But yeah that HBO Max stuff, that’ll have to wait. I’ll be working on it probably as soon as you see this video. It’ll be out eventually.
