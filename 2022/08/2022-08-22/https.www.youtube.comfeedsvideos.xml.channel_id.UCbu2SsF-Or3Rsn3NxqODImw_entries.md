Saints Row's character creator lets you create anyone. Here are just a few of our favorite creation running around Santo Illeso.
#gaming #saintsrow #gamespot

This video features gameplay of characters creation based on Big Smoke from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Handsome Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson from the WWE and almost every movie. 

The characters originally built into Saints Row include: the business mastermind Eli, who cares more about making the money than how the money is made. The getaway driver, Neenah, who is a member of the muscle car and exercise obsessed Los Panteros. As well as the people-pleaser Kevin, who is a member of the anarchist nightclub owners known as the Idols. 

Similar to the rest of the series, Saints Row is being developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. With this opportunity to start over, series developer Volition wanted to create criminals that were more relatable and one way of doing that was to show those goons starting from nothing. Each of the new criminals are just trying to make ends meet and head out on their own because they are tired of working for other gangs. Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west. 

Saints Row is available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. For more Saints Row coverage, stay tuned to GameSpot.

Dead Island 2 gameplay was shown off, PlayStation 5 teases its new premium controller and Warzone 2.0 may include the rumored DMZ mode.
#GamingNews #DeadIsland2 #PS5  

Dead Island 2 will feature six playable characters, one of whom is featured in the new cinematic trailer. Following that melee filled look, a gameplay-focused trailer was also revealed that provided a more detailed look at all six of the playable protagonists as well as the large variety of melee weapons and firearms at your disposal when dealing with the walking dead.

But games weren’t the only thing shown off at ONL, some hardware made an appearance as well. PlayStation 5 is getting a new high-performance controller called the DualSense Edge and surprise, it looks a lot like a standard DualSense controller except it appears slightly thicker.  It will feature customizable controls including full button remapping, stick sensitivity and dead zone settings, and trigger dead zone settings. It has a built-in Fn button to adjust settings like game volume and chat balance, and quickly swap between your control profiles. No price or release date was given. Which is unfortunate because this controller will be great for playing Warzone 2.0 which seemingly contains that rumored DMZ mode. 

The ESRB has posted its ratings description for Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0, and among other things, the listing contains a reference to "DMZ." The ratings description specifically mentions how players can take part in a "variety of multiplayer combat events," including battle royale, plunder-style skirmishes, and DMZ.

GTA V is getting another new coat of paint thanks to mods, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet get new battle details and The Game Awards has an official date.
#GamingNews #GTAV #pokemon 

NaturalVision is a long-running visual enhancement mod for GTA 5. The mod originally got a full release under the name NaturalVision Remastered, but development has continued under the moniker NaturalVision Evolved. In a new trailer, the team behind it shows off their work and outlines recent additions to the mod. This latest update adds parallax roads, pavement, and building interiors, giving the ground more layered textures and granting inaccessible interiors the illusion of depth. A wider variety of vegetation and volumetric clouds lend additional fidelity to the game's natural landscapes. The mod has yet to have a full release, but is in early access beta and you can download it for free on the Razed Mods website. 

At the conclusion of the 2022 Pokemon World Championships in London, The Pokemon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara unveiled a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which focused on battle mechanics and online play. The trailer opened with the introduction of a new Pokemon, the Dragon- and Normal-type Cyclizar, which showed off a new move called Shed Tail. 

After a 2021 event that saw the highest streaming numbers in its history, Geoff Keighley will present the 2022 Game Awards on December 8 live from Los Angeles. The ninth annual Game Awards will be broadcast live on over 40 streaming services around the world, but you’ll only have to worry about 2 of them because we’ll be broadcasting the event right here at GameSpot via our YouTube and Twitch channels.

The Saints Row reboot is here, and here is the first 20 minutes captured in 4K with a 2080 TI graphics card.

The long-awaited Saints Row reboot is finally here, and it is just as explosive as ever. In this video we're taking a look at the first 20 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay. The user created "Boss" finds himself working for a PMC company called Marshall. 

The Boss is hunting down a gang a leader with the help of his Marshall companions. In this video you'll see some cutscenes, gameplay, and how the ray-tracing is implemented in Saints Row.

Saints Row is available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. For more Saints Row coverage, stay tuned to GameSpot.

The Saints Row reboot ditches the over-the-top aspects of its predecessor, but still feels like it's trapped in the past.

It's been nine years since Saints Row IV was released, pitting the 3rd Street Saints against an alien invasion that featured superpowers, time-travel, Matrix-style simulations, and the complete destruction of Earth. Where do you go after a game so ridiculous and outlandish? After a period of absence, rebooting the series sounds like a logical next step, and that's exactly what developer Deep Silver Volition has done with this new, stripped-back Saints Row.

## The Redesign That Saved Deathloop

Before Deathloop was released to critical acclaim, early playtesters found the game so incomprehensible that it required a redesign in order to save the game from utter disaster.

Back in June 2020, the world saw gameplay from Deathloop for the very first time, revealing its slick gunplay, cool aesthetic, and an intriguing mystery to unravel. The video was met with roaring excitement.

For fans, the chance to delve into a new world developed by Arkane Lyon was exciting. Internally, however, Deathloop wasn't garnering the same enthusiasm, with a lot of early playtesters not understanding what the game even was.

Dana Nightingale, Deathloop's campaign director, tells the story of the redesign that saved the game from near disaster. Early user research had criticized the game for its obtuse and esoteric design, with some players confusing it for a different genre entirely. Much like the premise of the game, Dana had to approach the game's design from many different angles over and over again, until piecing together something coherent for early playtesters to understand only weeks before its official release date. 

This is the story of the redesign that saved Deathloop.
