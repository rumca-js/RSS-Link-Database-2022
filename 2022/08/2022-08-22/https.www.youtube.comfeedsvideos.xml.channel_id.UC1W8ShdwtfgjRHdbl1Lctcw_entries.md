I colorized, restored and worked a sound design of this video of the old Shanghai 1940s . You can see a lot of rickshaws, but not a lot of motorized vehicles, you can also see tramways and big buildings and people living their daily life,

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
