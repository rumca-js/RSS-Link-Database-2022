Red Dead 2 has become notable for its compelling characters and incredible story it weaves.\n#iheartgaming #reddeadredemption2 #rdr2 #reddead2 \n\nJoin Jake Baldino of gameranx, Brandon Jones of Easy Allies, Jared Petty of Kinda Funny, Gav Murphy of RKG, Lucy James of Giant Bomb, Cade Onder of ComicBook.com, DaveControl, plus Kurt Indovina and Jake Dekker of GameSpot as they discuss their love for Red Dead Redemption 2, and just how much the story and characters meant to them.\n\nJared Petty and Gav Murphy discuss how much they loved their horses, while Jake Baldino and Jared Petty talk about the leadership and eventual downfall of Dutch van der Linde. DaveControl, Gav Murphy, and Jake Dekker gush about their love for Arthur Morgan, while Lucy James and Kurt Indovina shudder in disgust at the thought of Micah, as Kurt revels in Arther and Micah's fight.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandon Jones and Jared Petty talk about how great it was to play as John Marston again during the game's epilogue. They all go over some of their favorite moments, including stumbling across a UFO in the game, getting drunk with Lenny, and the incredible plantation scene when the whole gang heads out to rescue Jack Marston.\n\nLet us know what future episodes you'd like to see, and what guests you hope to see on!

Despite a rumor, Amazon is reportedly not buying EA; and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gets an all new trailer.\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer, Nintendo's president said in a statement: \"we will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations,\" and do not have any plans to \"increase the trade price of its hardware.\" Instead, Nintendo is decreasing the size of Switch packaging to help with shipping issues, by making the cardboard box it comes in 20% smaller, which in turn will help the company's bottom line by using fewer materials.\u00a0\n\nEarly this morning a report suggested that Amazon was set to announce an acquisition of Electronic Arts later today. However, it didn't take long for the report to be denied.\u00a0After all, EA is reportedly pursuing a sale or merger, and is said to have had talks with Disney, Apple, Comcast, and, of course, Amazon. But as of now, there is no official news to report on of the behemoth developer/publisher being purchased at this time.\u00a0\n\nSouls-like fans have been eating well recently, because today we got a trailer for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a new Souls-like action game from Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, and Stranger of Paradise developer Team Ninja. The trailer is filled with sword fighting, Chinese martial arts, and otherworldly enemies and environments players will be exploring.\u00a0\n\nHere's your friendly reminder that Destiny 2 and all its expansions are free to play until August 30.

Due to the current strength of the dollar, The United States will not be affected by the change.\n\nLies of P, the newest entry in the Soulsborne genre got a 6 minute gameplay trailer today after being shown off at Opening Night Live.\u00a0The gameplay looks to emulate that feeling directly with attacks and parries that also incorporate Pinocchio\u2019s mechanical arm to shock or grapple enemies. Swords, hammers, and shields are your primary tools for bashing baddies. Developer Neowiz has not set a hard and fast release date yet, but expect to explore the desolate world of Lies of P in early 2023.\n\nEA and DICE have announced the first details on Battlefield 2042 Season 2.
