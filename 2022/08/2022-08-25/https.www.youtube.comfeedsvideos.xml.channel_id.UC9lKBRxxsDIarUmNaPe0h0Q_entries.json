And if you saw our story from two weeks ago about China's economic crisis, well this was only half of the story.\n\nRight now in China, it seems like things couldn't get much worse for its economy. But that's when you realise there may be an estimated 50 million empty homes throughout the country, as a result of property developers biting off more than they could handle, as well as getting greedy. The result is that thousands of people are now refusing to pay mortgages, and many Chinese banks are on the verge of collapse. China is also filled with ghost cities, comprising millions of empty apartments.\n\nThis is one of the biggest economic news stories on the planet right now, however it's not getting the kind of coverage it should in the media. And quite possibly, that's because the CCP is possibly trying to suppress this real estate story from getting out.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this below.\n\n0:00 - China's real estate bubble\n1:10 - Why real estate is so important in China\n2:13 - How China's bubble started to grow\n4:26 - The big Chinese real estate scam\n6:54 - How this could affect the West\n7:50 - It's a big lesson in debt\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
