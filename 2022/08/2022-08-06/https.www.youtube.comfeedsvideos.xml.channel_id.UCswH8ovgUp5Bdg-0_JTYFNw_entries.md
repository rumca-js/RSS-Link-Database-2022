Mis-information and dis-information. Who should be responsible for deciding what truth we’re told?… We should leave that up to the Government, shouldn’t we? #misinformation #disinformation #government

With his popularity amongst the US public at an all-time low, this week Joe Biden announced the killing of an al-Qaida leader via US drone strike. This comes weeks after Biden met with the Saudi Crown Prince, and subsequently approving a $3 billion Saudi arms sale.
