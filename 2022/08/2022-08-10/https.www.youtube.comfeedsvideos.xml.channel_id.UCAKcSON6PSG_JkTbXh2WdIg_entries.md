Matthew French released two albums in 2022: "Two Sides: (Side 1)," and "Two Sides: (Side 2)." The first side was released earlier this year, and Side 2 just came out at the end of July, and each “side” has a slightly different feel due to the lyrics. At the end of July, Matthew French visited the Radio Heartland studio to perform music from both albums. 

This song, "You Got Me," is from "Two Sides (Side 2)."
