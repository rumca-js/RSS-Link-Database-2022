Your number one resource for entire weeks worth of VR news!\n\nToday we have some very interesting stories, from Quest V43 update information, Quest Pro, Pico 4, and PSVR2... Meta is about to receive CRAZY pressure from the entire industry. We are about to hit real competition. But in a turn for the worse, the Quest is straight up losing support for some titles and I hope this doesn't become a trend. Really right now, this spells the beginning of the end for the Oculus Quest and with all of this competition.. I also believe this spells the beginning of the end of the \"era of Quest and Quest 2\" \n\nGIVEAWAY LINKS: \nGiveaway:\nhttps://bit.ly/3vyG90k\nDiscord:\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\n\nOUTRO MUSIC: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Jwg...\nNew Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmR...\nTikTok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thrillseekerv...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy6YYY6R13Q", "date_published": "2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
