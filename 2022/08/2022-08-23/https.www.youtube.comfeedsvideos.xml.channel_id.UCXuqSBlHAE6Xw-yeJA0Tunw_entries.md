Thanks to Seasonic for sponsoring the unboxing of our new Power Supply Tester, and helping us spec it out! Buy a Seasonic Prime Platinum PX-1300W: https://geni.us/R0aH6

To prep for our upcoming Labs initiative, we ordered something more expensive than BOTH of Linus' vehicles combined... a massive Power Supply Tester worth $133,000. We can't wait to test it out, but find out how it works now!
