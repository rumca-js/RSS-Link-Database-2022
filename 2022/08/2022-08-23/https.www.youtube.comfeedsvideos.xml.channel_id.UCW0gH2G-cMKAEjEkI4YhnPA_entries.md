We got a surprise "official trailer" for The Rings of Power today - perhaps the final trailer before the first episode premieres, so we are going to break down the new shots and a couple interesting notes.  Also, I think I've narrowed down a potentially huge moment in the series and how a lot of the storylines connect in a very specific location in Middle-earth - the future lands of Mordor!
