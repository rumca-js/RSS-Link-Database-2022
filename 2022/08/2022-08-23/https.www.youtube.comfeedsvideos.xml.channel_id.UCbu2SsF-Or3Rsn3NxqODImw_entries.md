Splatoon 3 takes everything Nintendo learned from two games and a large-scale expansion and then adds even more to make a robust, ink-soaked package.
#splatoon3 #gamespot #nintendo 

Splatoon 3 looks to be the most robust Splatoon package yet. At a hands-on event, we tried three distinct modes that show the breadth of the content offerings in Splatoon 3: the single-player Return of the Mammalians campaign, the cooperative wave-based Salmon Run, and the traditional competitive Turf War battles. The underlying mechanics still feel as great as ever, but now there's just way more to do with them.

Saints Row's character creator lets you create anyone. Here are just a few of our favorite creation running around Santo Illeso.
#gaming #saintsrow #gamespot

This video features gameplay of characters creation based on Big Smoke from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Handsome Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson from the WWE and almost every movie. 

The characters originally built into Saints Row include: the business mastermind Eli, who cares more about making the money than how the money is made. The getaway driver, Neenah, who is a member of the muscle car and exercise obsessed Los Panteros. As well as the people-pleaser Kevin, who is a member of the anarchist nightclub owners known as the Idols. 

Similar to the rest of the series, Saints Row is being developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. With this opportunity to start over, series developer Volition wanted to create criminals that were more relatable and one way of doing that was to show those goons starting from nothing. Each of the new criminals are just trying to make ends meet and head out on their own because they are tired of working for other gangs. Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west. 

Saints Row is available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. For more Saints Row coverage, stay tuned to GameSpot.

Dead Island 2 gameplay was shown off, PlayStation 5 teases its new premium controller and Warzone 2.0 may include the rumored DMZ mode.
#GamingNews #DeadIsland2 #PS5  

Dead Island 2 will feature six playable characters, one of whom is featured in the new cinematic trailer. Following that melee filled look, a gameplay-focused trailer was also revealed that provided a more detailed look at all six of the playable protagonists as well as the large variety of melee weapons and firearms at your disposal when dealing with the walking dead.

But games weren’t the only thing shown off at ONL, some hardware made an appearance as well. PlayStation 5 is getting a new high-performance controller called the DualSense Edge and surprise, it looks a lot like a standard DualSense controller except it appears slightly thicker.  It will feature customizable controls including full button remapping, stick sensitivity and dead zone settings, and trigger dead zone settings. It has a built-in Fn button to adjust settings like game volume and chat balance, and quickly swap between your control profiles. No price or release date was given. Which is unfortunate because this controller will be great for playing Warzone 2.0 which seemingly contains that rumored DMZ mode. 

The ESRB has posted its ratings description for Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0, and among other things, the listing contains a reference to "DMZ." The ratings description specifically mentions how players can take part in a "variety of multiplayer combat events," including battle royale, plunder-style skirmishes, and DMZ.
