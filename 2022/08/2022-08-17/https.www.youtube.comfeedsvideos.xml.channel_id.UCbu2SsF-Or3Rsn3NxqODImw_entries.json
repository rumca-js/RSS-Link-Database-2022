Instead of picking up where part 4 left off, this new entry is taking you back to the beginning with an all new cast of characters causing mayhem in a brand new city. Here is everything you need to know about Saints Row.\n#Gaming #saintsrow \n\nSimilar to the rest of the series, Saints Row is being developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. With this opportunity to start over, series developer Volition wanted to create criminals that were more relatable and one way of doing that was to show those goons starting from nothing. Each of the new criminals are just trying to make ends meet and head out on their own because they are tired of working for other gangs. Their goal is to get rich and take over the fictional city of Santo Ileso, a huge and vibrant sandbox in the American south west.\u00a0\n\nSaints Row\u2019s new cast of characters include: the business mastermind Eli, who cares more about making the money than how the money is made. The getaway driver, Neenah, who is a member of the muscle car and exercise obsessed Los Panteros. As well as the people-pleaser Kevin, who is a member of the anarchist nightclub owners known as the Idols.\u00a0\n\nSaints Row is scheduled to launch on August 23, 2022. The game was originally set to release on February 25 before being delayed so that the team could do a little bit more fine tuning. The game will be released for both current and past generation consoles, as well as PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z636bnaEE10", "date_published": "2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warzone 2 Release Date May Have Leaked | GameSpot News", "description": "Warzone 2 and World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Release dates may have leaked.

If the image is indeed legitimate, WoW players can expect to have their hands on the game's next expansion, Dragonflight, on November 28, with the game's pre-patch arriving roughly a month earlier, on October 25.
