Here's GameSpot's review.\n\nRollerdrome is similar to Roll7's other titles in that it's a single-player skating game that emphasizes performing tricks, but this isn't just an OlliOlli game with guns. Rollerdrome eschews the side-scrolling nature of Roll7's famous platformer series for fully 3D skate park-like arenas; as you skate through a single area, you must utilize walls and ramps to loop yourself around and to perform tricks.\n\nThough it makes departures from the skating games that Roll7 is known for, Rollerdrome nails what's most important about them: it's an easy game to play that makes you feel awesome while you're playing it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siMJklKuyPQ", "date_published": "2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Thymesia Review", "description": "Thymesia creates a Souls-like experience that iterates on what's most important about FromSoftware's beloved titles Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.\n\n#Gaming #GameSpot #Thymesia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihGDFIDmP9o", "date_published": "2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "16 MORE Things You STILL Didn't Know In Zelda Breath Of The Wild", "description": "This time in Breath of the Wild, we dive and sink into the water to find things unknown far underwater, NPC reactions that you may not have seen before, and the secret behind the Zora domain and its ties to music.\n\nIn the video above, we cover 16 facts, tips and tricks that aren\u2019t quite as well known, ranging from secrets to glitches that are pretty simple and others that are fairly complex.
