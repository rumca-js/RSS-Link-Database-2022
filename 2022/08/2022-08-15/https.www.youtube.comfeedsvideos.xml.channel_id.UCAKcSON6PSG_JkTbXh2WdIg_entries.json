One improbable indicator of that connection? The deep, personal significance that can be found in nonsensical lyrics. \n\nWatch the complete session above.\n\nVideo segments:\n0:00:00 \u201cChapstick\u201d\n0:03:26 \u201cGetting Older\u201d\n0:05:42 \u201cBrad Pitt\u201d\n0:07:58 Interview with host Ayisha Jaffer\n\nCOIN are:\nChase Lawrence - vocals, keys\nJoe Memmel - guitar\nRyan Winnen - drums\nMatt Martin - bass\n\nCredits\nHost \u2013 Ayisha Jaffer  \nGuests \u2013 COIN \nTechnical director \u2013 Erik Stromstad \nAudio \u2013 Evan Clark\nCamera Operators \u2013 Erik Stromstad, Peter Ecklund, Thor Cramer Bornemann\nVideo Editor \u2013 Eric Xu Romani \nProducers \u2013 Derrick Stevens, Jesse Wiza \nDigital producer \u2013 Luke Taylor \n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
