Advanced power settings: org - GNOME - settings-daemon - Plugins - power in dconf-editor.

Nautilus

Control + H: displays hidden files and folders
Control + L: lets you type in the path bar

ORG, GNOME, NAUTILUS, PREFERENCES, check "always use location entry" to make that permanent.

You can also decide to change the format to compress files: ORG, GNOME, NAUTILUS, COMPRESSION.

In your /home folder, you have a Templates folder. Everything you put in there will show up in a right click, new Document menu.

Install from the package nautilus-image-converter, and then completely quit nautilus by typing nautilus-q in a terminal, to get right click options to resize or rotate images.

If you use nextcloud, install the nextcloud-client-nautilus package, restart Nautilus.

If you need to quickly access your recent locations, right click the back or forward button.

If you want to change a specific folder's icon, right click the folder, hit properties, click on the folder's icon, and fetch the image you want to use.

You can also install gnome-sushi to get a "press spacebar to preview file" utility, like macOS quicklook

If you want to adjust your volume by smaller, or bigger steps, head over to ORG GNOME SETTINGS DAEMON PLUGINS MEDIA KEYS, you can find an option named "volume-step".

To disable overlay scrollbars, head over to ORG GNOME DESKTOP INTERFACE and disable overlay-scrolling.

If you don't like having an image as your wallpaper, and prefer a color or a gradient, you can go to ORG GNOME DESKTOP BACKGROUND, and set picture-uri to none

Then in the same folder, in primary-color, enter the hexadecimal value for your color.

And if you want a gradient, also set the secondary color to the one you want, and enable the color shading type horizontal or vertical option.

You can expand the resizeable handle size, by going to ORG GNOME MUTTER, and changing the draggable border width value.

You can have the option to logout always visible by going to ORG GNOME SHELL, and turning on always-show-log-out

Alt + F2: pressing this allows you to run a quick command.

Alt + the key immediately above tab: switch between windows of the same app

ALT + printscreen:  capture the current focused window

SHIFT + printscreen captures the whole screen.

Control + alt + shift + r: open this interface in video recording mode.

Control + Alt + delete: open the power off dialog

Super x2 : open the apps grid

Super +ToM: open the notifications panel

Super + middle mouse button: resize a window
