## Rollerdrome Review

Developer Roll7 excellently mixes high-scoring skating gameplay with shooter ideas to make a hybrid game that's tough to put down. Here's GameSpot's review.

Rollerdrome is similar to Roll7's other titles in that it's a single-player skating game that emphasizes performing tricks, but this isn't just an OlliOlli game with guns. Rollerdrome eschews the side-scrolling nature of Roll7's famous platformer series for fully 3D skate park-like arenas; as you skate through a single area, you must utilize walls and ramps to loop yourself around and to perform tricks.

Though it makes departures from the skating games that Roll7 is known for, Rollerdrome nails what's most important about them: it's an easy game to play that makes you feel awesome while you're playing it.

Thymesia creates a Souls-like experience that iterates on what's most important about FromSoftware's beloved titles Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

We'll check out the new FieldSENSE and much more. The FieldSENSE system addresses more than just tackling, however. It touches on virtually every part of the field, with EA Tiburon citing improvements to DBs covering wideouts, to pass rushers collapsing the pocket and getting to QBs, and with better blocking in the trenches.
