Announced at THQ Nordic's 2022 games showcase, the new Alone in the Dark reboots the 1992 original, updating the story and refreshing its classic gameplay.
#gaming #gamename #gamespot 

Publisher THQ Nordic is rebooting Alone in the Dark--but rather than a new game in the series, developer Pieces Interactive is returning to the 1992 original to put a modern spin on the game that helped give rise to the modern survival horror genre. The new game is a third-person title that reimagines the original game, making adjustments to its story and gameplay, while attempting to capture the suspense and atmosphere that made Alone in the Dark so memorable.

THQ announced the return of Alone in the Dark during its 2022 game showcase, in which it showed off a trailer that gives a sense of the expanded, more cinematic version of the tale the reboot will tell. GameSpot got an expanded look at the game, which included an explanation of its story, setting, characters, and gameplay. Like the original Alone in the Dark, the reboot is largely set in a mansion called Derceto Manor in the 1920s American South. This time, however, it's not a mansion, but a mental hospital for rich clients--and the game will include additional settings, as well.

Also returning from the original are Alone in the Dark's playable characters, Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood. Both are playable in the new game, and both play a larger part in the other character's story. In fact, like in later survival horror games such as Resident Evil 2, the stories experienced by Edward and Emily are different from one another, taking you through a different tale depending on which you choose.

Alone in the Dark is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but THQ Nordic hasn't yet announced a release date.

Multiversus season 1 is dropping soon, THQ Nordic announced a ton of new games, and Sonic Frontiers isn't getting a delay.
#Gaming #Multiversus #Sonic 

Multiversusâ€™ season 1 launch gets a new date, new announcements from THQ Nordic, and Sonic Frontiers is sticking to its release among a sea of delays. All this on todayâ€™s GameSpot News.

What began as an indefinite delay has turned into a short one-week wait, as MultiVersus Season 1 has been confirmed for a August 15 start date, while also confirming that the first new character of the season--Morty Smith from Rick and Morty--will debut eight days later on August 23.

Morty isn't the only character confirmed for MultiVersus Season 1, as his grandpa Rick Sanchez will also join the roster during the game's inaugural season. No release date has been announced for Rick's addition.

The developers also shared a snapshot of what the first season of MultiVersus will be adding to the game, including online ranked lobbies, a single-player arcade mode, and more characters beyond the already confirmed Rick and Morty.

Just waiting on that Larry David announcement now.

THQ Nordic had a massive showcase today, including new game announcements.

The rumors were true: a new Alone in the Dark is coming, returning the series all the way back to its 1992 roots to revisit key elements of a game that helped give birth to the survival horror genre. 

It features a lot of elements from the 1992 title, including its setting, Derceto Manor, and its two main playable characters: private detective Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA writer Mikael Hedberg will be penning the gameâ€™s script, who says that the story will be more active than the original; expect cinematic cutscenes and voiced dialogue, in addition to notes, letters, and other items you'll find as you explore Derceto Manor and the rest of the world.

Wreckreation is coming from Three Fields Entertainment, a studio made up of developers from Electronic Arts and Criterion Games, including folks who previously worked on the Burnout and Need for Speed series, and it's clear the "wreck" side of the game draws inspiration from those beloved racing titles. 

Stunts, crashes, and takedowns are a big part of the events you'll compete in, and it sounds like just about everything in the game will provide you opportunities for those competitions. Instead of covering a city, Wreckreation takes place in its own drivable state, made up of four different counties that you can explore to discover shortcuts, challenges, and breakable billboards. There are 400 square kilometers of area in the game, and you can drive on all of it, according to Three Fields.

See how the recent PC port of Marvel's Spider-Man compares visually to the PlayStation 5 version.

For this comparison, we ran Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man Remastered on PS5 in 4K fidelity mode, which offers the highest resolution and ray traced reflections at 30fps.

The PC version was set to 4K resolution max settings, including the highest level of ray tracing, using a machine with the following specs: RTX 3080 Ti, Intel i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz, 1TB NVME SDD. Features like DLSS and upscaling were turned off for this comparison.  PC was locked to 30fps for a stable frame rate. 

Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man Remastered is coming to PC on August 12, 2022. The port includes ultrawide support, an unlocked frame rate, improved shadows, ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), Nvidia Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA) and more. The game also supports the DualSense controllers as well as mouse and keyboard setups. Cloud saves and achievements are supported on both the Epic Games Store and Steam.

Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will also come to PC sometime in Fall 2022. 

Marvel's Spider-Man originally launched on PlayStation 4 in September 2018. The remastered version came packaged with the ultimate edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which launched with the PlayStation 5 on November 12, 2020. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was announced during the PlayStation showcase in September 2021, featuring Peter Parker and Miles Morales teaming up to fight crime. A PC version of the sequel as yet to be confirmed.

## Sony Reportedly Paying To Keep Games Off Game Pass | GameSpot News

Microsoft claims Sony is paying devs to not put their games on Game Pass, Tower of Fantasy has a wild launch, and Dragon Ball Z is coming to Fortnite.
#Gaming #PS5 #Fortnite #DragonBallZ 

Microsoft fires back at Sony, Tower of Fantasy struggles to launch, and a long awaited Fortnite crossover has been teased! All this on todayâ€™s GameSpot News.

According to documents filed with Brazilâ€™s national competition regulator, Microsoft has claimed that Sony has paid "blocking rights" to developers to prevent their games from being added to Xbox Game Pass. As part of the regulator's review of Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company alleged that Sony had "hampered" the growth of its Game Pass subscription service with its business practices.

Microsoft's response comes shortly after Sony made its own claim about its users jumping ship to Xbox if Microsoft's deal to purchase Activision Blizzard, and by extension, the Call of Duty franchise, is completed. Microsoft has disputed that claim, and had also previously indicated that it would continue supporting Call of Duty on PlayStation "beyond the existing agreement" and into the future.

Another day, another Genshin Impact-esque game launches. Tower of Fantasy, a new gacha MMORPG, ran into a few launch issues when its servers went live in specific regions last night. But worry not, because developer Hotta Studios has announced that the problems have been fixed or will be within 48 hours--and players are entitled to some freebies.

To make up for the inconveniences caused by registration failures and login errors, Hotta is giving out a total of 600 Dark Crystals to all players who have registered by 5 PM PT/8 PM ET today, August 11. Dark Crystals can be used for a variety of things, but can notably be converted into four Red Nucleus to be used in Tower of Fantasy's premium gacha banner.

Hotta Studios also announced it would be giving away more freebies to celebrate Tower of Fantasy reaching the "top free game charts" in 22 countries prior to the game's global launch. All players who register prior to August 17 will receive 10 Gold Nucleus, which are used for gacha pulls for the game's standard banner. The Gold Nucleus reward will be mailed to players within the next 24 hours and will need to be claimed within 14 days. Once the items are in a player's inventory, they don't expire.

Tower of Fantasy, which is free-to-play, seems to be off to a solid start. Login queues on many servers were long at launch, and the game as of writing has more than 133,000 viewers on Twitch. Though the game is comparable to Genshin Impact--with familiar combat, gacha systems, user interface, and a similar art style--Tower of Fantasy's sci-fi setting, custom character-creator, focus on multiplayer (including PvP), and the addition of vehicles help it to stand out from MiHoYo's popular gacha game.

Tower of Fantasy is available now on PC, iOS, and Android devices and allows for cross-platform multiplayer. For now, those interested in playing on PC can download Tower of Fantasy through the official website, but the title is slated to come to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year.
