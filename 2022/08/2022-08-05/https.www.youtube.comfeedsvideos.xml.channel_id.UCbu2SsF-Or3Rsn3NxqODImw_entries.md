SquareSoft's Final Fantasy VII is a beloved classic, and one of the most influential JRPGs of all time. While there had been Final Fantasy games before, it was FFVII on the PS1 that truly took the world by storm, and would become one of Playstation's top selling games.

Join Brad Ellis of Easy Allies, DaveControl, Darryl of Final Fantasy Union, Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain of Giant Bomb, Maximilian Dood, Mike Brown of Resonant Arc, SquidGame, Super Eyepatch Wolf, The Completionist, The Night Sky Prince, and Trisha Hershberger as they discuss the impact FFVII has had on them and the gaming industry as a whole in this love letter to Final Fantasy VII.

Final Fantasy VII takes players on an adventure as they join the likes of Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith, and more throughout Midgar and beyond. Super Eyepatch Wolf, Maximilian Dood, and The Night Sky Prince discuss their hurdle of getting over turn-based battles, while The Completionist and Trisha Hersberger talk about how incredible the initial Bombing Mission was.

SquidGame laments Aerith's downfall, while DaveControl and Final Fantasy Union joke about how it didn't impact them too much. The group discuss their favorite moments from the Gold Saucer, earning a golden chocobo, how ridiculous Nights of the Round is, and some of their favorite boss battles.

Meanwhile, they go over the incredible music written by Nobuo Uematsu, talk their favorite characters, and gush about Cloud's iconic buster sword.

Let us know what future episodes you'd like to see, and what guests you hope to see on!

Multiversus has strong fundamentals, charm, and attention to detail that Smash clones that came before sorely lacked, making it one of the best platform fighting games ever made.

Microsoft is testing a way to share Game Pass with family, Blizzard isn’t interested in another Overwatch 2 beta and the future Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks may have been discovered early.
#Gamingnews #GamePass #mariokart8deluxe 

Microsoft has begun testing an Xbox Game Pass family plan in two countries, which will allow users to share their subscription with other people. Available in Colombia and Ireland, subscribers can add up to four people in their country to their membership. Current pricing for Game Pass comes in at $10 for either the PC or console version, while the $15 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier adds a number of other expansive options for play. This isn’t confirmed but lets say the family plan is $25 a month and you get 3 friends and your lame little brother to join you, that's $5 a person.

Blizzard has confirmed Overwatch 2 will not receive a third beta prior to the game's launch. The news comes via tweets from Overwatch commercial leader Jon Spector. Instead of running another beta, the team will be using feedback received from the game's alpha and two public beta tests to focus on "launching the best game possible on Oct. 4," Spector writes. Overwatch 2, which will replace the original Overwatch upon release, will be free-to-play and won't include loot boxes. It will instead allow players to purchase cosmetics directly, and will also introduce a battle pass into Blizzard's FPS for the first time.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe placeholder music files have been discovered following the latest update which could be hinting at the future Booster Course Pass DLC circuits. The tracks possibly heading to MK8D are London Loop from Mario Kart Tour, Peach Gardens from DS, and Boo Lake/Broken Pier from Game Boy Advance just to name a few.
