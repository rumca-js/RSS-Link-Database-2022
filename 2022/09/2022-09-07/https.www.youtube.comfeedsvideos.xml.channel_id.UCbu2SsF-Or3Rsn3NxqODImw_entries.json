PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has responded to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying his company would go above and beyond industry standards and keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for years to come if the Xbox company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard goes through. \n\nRyan told GI.biz that Microsoft offered to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for specifically three years after the existing deal between Activision and Sony finishes. Ryan said this was \"inadequate on many levels.\"\n\n\"Microsoft has only offered for Call of Duty to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends,\" Ryan said. \"After almost 20 years of Call of Duty on PlayStation, their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take account of the impact on our gamers. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality Call of Duty experience, and Microsoft's proposal undermines this principle.\"\n\nWe don't know, however, what the duration of the previously agreed-upon deal between Sony and Activision for Call of Duty was. But whatever that is, it'll be extended by three years, apparently, but what happens after that is unclear. Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard is currently being reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world. New Zealand will be among the next countries to weigh in, with a decision due by September 9.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, the company is looking to give the Xbox UI a makeover, with a number of changes planned that will roll out as experiments for Xbox Insiders over the next few months.\n\nA key new feature is a planned \"jump back in\" row, which is designed to give players quick access to their most-recently-played games and apps. System apps like Settings, Store, Search and My Games & Apps will be easier to access as they will have their own tiles on Xbox Home. Microsoft notes that the rollout will be slow to start, and that Xbox will be iterating throughout the process, but a full launch of the new UI is planned for sometime in 2023. \n\nWhile Xbox and PlayStation bicker over Call of Duty, Battlefield has been making some moves. Marcus Lehto, who designed Master Chief and co-created the Halo universe, is heading up a brand-new Battlefield studio in Seattle. Electronic Arts announced that the studio is called Ridgeline Games, and it will develop a \"narrative campaign\" for Battlefield. Very little is known right now, but EA said this campaign will \"engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.\"\n\nAnother big announcement was that Battlefield creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has worked on the Battlefield series since it started in 2002, is departing the team. \nDespite hiccups at launch, the series\u2019 latest entry Battlefield 2042 was the fifth best-selling game of 2021 in the US. With these announcements, EA reiterated that it wants fans to know that EA is \"all-in on Battlefield.\" The company has DICE continuing to work on Battlefield's \"multiplayer suite,\" EA said, while another studio Ripple Effect will create an \"entirely new Battlefield experience that will complement and build upon the series' foundations.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5NCZPboZY", "date_published": "2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Division Resurgence: What\u2019s Coming To The Mobile Game | Swipe Mobile Showcase", "description": "Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence is a mobile MMO that brings open-world exploration and shooting to your pocket.\u00a0\n#gaming #thedivision #gamespot \n\nWe got a chance to speak to Fabrice Navrez, executive producer on The Division Resurgence, about how the game will bring the same Division experience to your mobile game.\n\nThe Division Resurgence will open with a scene set before the events of the first game, but then transition to its main storyline, which sits between the first and second game on the timeline. Players will return to New York City and visit iconic locations like Liberty Island and Times Square.\u00a0\n\nThe game recently completed its first closed alpha test, and there was positive feedback received thus far with the MMO aspects, including the ability to meet players out in the streets of New York as opposed to only in safe zones, resulting in what Navrez called interesting encounters.\n\nThe video also details two of the six classes available in the closed alpha: the Demolitionist, who carries a heavy gun that inflicts explosive area-of-effect damage, and the Bulwark, which is a melee tank class designed to draw enemy fire and deal massive damage up-close.\u00a0\n\nThe Division Resurgence will release on iOS and Android at launch, though a specific timeframe has not yet been announced.

For those playing a game with a higher native resolution, such as 4K, Sony said they \"may benefit from improved anti-aliasing through supersampling down to 1440p output.\"\n\nAs for game lists, players can now create these in their Game Library to help make organizing games easier. Game lists can support up to 100 games, and users can have up to 15 lists. Players can select any game to add to a list, whether it be on a disc, digital, or streaming.\n\nOn the hardware side, YouTuber Austin Evans got his hands on the new PlayStation 5 model that was discovered in the wild last week. Upon opening it, he discovered that the motherboard is around two inches smaller and that the SSD enclosure no longer has a printed circuit board through the entire length of the device and has more exposed metal, which Evans believes will dissipate heat more efficiently.\n\nThe cooling setup now has an additional heat pipe and a smaller heatsink, with the entire build now being around a pound lighter than the original PS5's hardware. As for tangible benefits, Evans theorized that this model will draw around 20-30 watts of power less during gaming sessions but heat and noise output will remain roughly the same.\n\nSo for everyone that\u2019s been struggling to find a PlayStation 5 over the last nearly two years, rest easy knowing that when you do eventually pick one up, it will likely be an improved model.\n\nIf you ended up making the Xbox Series X or S your console of choice this generation, Microsoft has a great new accessory for you.  The Xbox Elite Series 2 \"Core\" model is a cheaper version of Xbox\u2019s regular Elite Series 2 with fewer features.\n\nPriced at $130, the controller has adjustable-tension thumbsticks, a rubberized grip on the handles, and hair trigger locks. Button-mapping is available through the Xbox Accessories app, just like it is for the regular model.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWg5mqyinAU", "date_published": "2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Pok\u00e9mon Violet Seek Your Treasure Official Trailer", "description": "In Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Pok\u00e9mon Violet, the school you\u2019ve enrolled in hosts a special independent study project.
