0:00 - Intro
0:54 - Different 'Types' of PowerShell
5:36 - PowerShell Core
8:05 - PowerShell ISE
9:42 - Should You Install It?

Corrections:
6:03 - The "Core" naming was actually dropped from .NET Core, and now it is just called ".NET". Though I believe it is still a subset of the overall ".NET Framework"
8:05 - While Powershell ISE is included with Windows Powershell 5.1, it is no longer being actively developed. Instead, the official recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell Extension
