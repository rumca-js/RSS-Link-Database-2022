LTT just released a new ratcheting screwdriver, and it costs $69.99. Is it merch or is it a quality tool that can match other pro tools in its price class?

I bought screwdrivers from PB Swiss, Snap-On, Wera, and more to see which ratcheting screwdriver is the best!

I'm GIVING ONE AWAY, too! Follow me on Twitter and I'll tweet the entry form later today: https://twitter.com/geerlingguy
