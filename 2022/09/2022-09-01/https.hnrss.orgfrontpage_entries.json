5 days to 4 days would be an arbitrary decision, with very little real impact. (Of course I'm referring to jobs done in typical 5 day week).<p>For those who say it would lead to a decrease in productivity. Well that is only relative to the 5 day week. And the 5 day week, only exist because of some archaic reasons. It is not some law ingrained in the universe.<p>And beyond that we can see that increases of productivity has not led to increase of leisure time, maybe the opposite.<p>And we know many people who work barely a fraction of the week, yet need to maintain this kind of presenteeism. It seems absurd.

Customers wanted to bring data into their source of truth without having to maintain custom built pipelines or introduce security risks by contracting a third-party ETL/ELT provider.<p>After seeing Stripe <a href=\"https://stripe.com/data-pipeline\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stripe.com/data-pipeline</a> and customer.io <a href=\"https://customer.io/data-warehouse\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://customer.io/data-warehouse</a> recently invest in building out their own native data sharing products, we realized that many SaaS companies could better support their customers and even generate additional revenue by offering native data pipelines.<p>Our goal with Pipebird is to make creating a reliable data pipeline as simple as pressing a button from a vendor's dashboard.<p>With the current iteration of the product, data can be selected from a number of sources (ex: Postgres, MySQL, CockroachDB, etc.), customers can configure pipelines and optionally apply transformations (like type casting), and data can be periodically synced directly to customers\u2019 warehouses (ex: Snowflake). We\u2019re actively adding sources/destinations and would appreciate any feature requests.<p>Here's a 2 min demo of the product <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/c7a7e4b4e57c4015b533fd754c510b2e\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/c7a7e4b4e57c4015b533fd754c510b2e</a><p>Pipebird is open source (MIT license) so that any developer can use it. Our aim is to not charge individual developers - we make money selling paid plans that include features like multiple projects, user permissions, additional security features, managed infra, support, etc.<p>Give us a whirl: <a href=\"https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird</a>.

Please take action as appropriate for your organization.<p>We hear from you that you want the full richness of Microsoft Teams features on Linux such as background effects, reactions, gallery view, etc. We found the best way to act on this is to offer a Teams progressive web app (PWA) on Linux as a new feature of our current web client, which we\u2019ll make available to our Linux customers in the coming months. PWA enables us to ship the latest Teams features faster to our Linux customers and helps us bridge the gaps that existed between the Teams desktop client on Linux and Windows. The PWA experience will be available on both Edge and Chrome browsers on Linux.<p>We will be retiring the Microsoft Teams desktop client on Linux in 90 days (early December), which is currently available in public preview. All users on the Microsoft Teams Linux desktop client will have to transition to the web or PWA version, which is where we will continue to invest our development resources. We are committed to helping all current customers on Linux start using the PWA app; we\u2019ll publish guidance once we are closer to releasing this feature.<p>Teams PWA is an evolution of our Linux web experience - it offers the \u201cbest of the web with key functionalities of client\u201d: zero-install, lightweight, and has a rich set of features. For example, the PWA version supports features such as:<p>Background blur and custom backgrounds\nReactions and raise hand in meetings\nLarge gallery and together mode\nPWA also provides desktop-like app features such as:<p>System notifications for chat and channel\nDock icon with respective controls\nApplication auto-start\nEasy access to system app permissions\nWhen will this happen?<p>We plan to make Microsoft Teams PWA on Linux generally available in the coming months.<p>How will this affect me?<p>If your users/administrators use the Microsoft Teams Linux desktop client, they either need to set up the Microsoft Teams PWA (when it is generally available) or use the Teams Linux web app to ensure business continuity.<p>What do you need to do to prepare?<p>To prepare, we recommend informing all your users about the upcoming changes, encouraging them to switch over to the PWA (when it is generally available) to get the latest features on Linux along with a desktop-like experience. Microsoft will publish a blog post about this change and how to install Teams as a PWA on Edge and Chrome once we are closer to making this feature generally available on Linux in the coming months.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678839\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678839</a></p>\n<p>Points: 68</p>\n<p># Comments: 42</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678839", "date_published": "2022-09-01 16:29:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Run Stable Diffusion on Your M1 Mac\u2019s GPU", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac\">https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678664\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678664</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac", "date_published": "2022-09-01 16:19:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Launch HN: SideGuide (YC S22) \u2013 Learn APIs by running them in live environments", "description": "<p>Hey HN! It\u2019s Eric, Caleb, Nick, and Garrett from SideGuide (<a href=\"https://www.sideguide.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sideguide.dev/</a>). We give developers and technical PMs an easy way to learn and evaluate API/SDK products using live code environments. Our product is a lightweight, embeddable, online code environment that lets you play with APIs and SDKs in one click.<p>Companies use us to let developers experiment with fully-configured examples with zero setup. If you saw Hyperbeam\u2019s interactive example on Show HN a few days ago (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32598062\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32598062</a>), that was built using SideGuide.<p>We originally started as a B2C coding education platform after graduating college. Knowing how to use APIs has become a critical part of solving meaningful coding problems, but we watched hundreds of devs struggle to learn from API documentation. API and SDK documentation is often lacking in depth and interactive examples, leading to an incomplete understanding both of the implementation process (how to get an API or SDK working) and of the value (what you can actually do with it). We repeatedly saw students floundering with this, then wasting hours re-inventing the wheel instead of using an off-the-shelf solution.<p>Eventually we realized that the pain of getting an API or SDK running wasn\u2019t just limited to students, but is something that developers have to deal with all the time\u2014especially when deciding whether or not to use a particular product. When you just want to quickly test an API, you shouldn\u2019t have to futz around with installations, dependencies, and whatnot. Developers and technical PMs should be able to quickly play with the real code before investing time and money in a product. That is why we built SideGuide.<p>SideGuide allows API/SDK companies to create instant live coding environments that help their prospective users (developers) understand the implementation process and product value through real guided examples.<p>A company can create a live code environment/sandbox from a GitHub repo of any product example or lab. These online code sandboxes allow developers to quickly play around and learn with no setup or friction and after they are done they export the repo for use in their own projects.<p>These sandboxes can have optional guides that walk potential users through different parts of the implemented code. The steps in the guides can be attached to any file or code block in the project, so nuance in the code or structure can easily be explained.<p>In addition, we provide observability and a feedback mechanism for the sandboxes. This is so examples and guides can constantly be improved and support can be delivered when it\u2019s needed.<p>Getting this right is a challenge because it\u2019s only valuable if you create an experience that developers love. That means spinning up environments quickly, tight integration with API documentation/authentication, and flexible workflows for all of the different types of developers.<p>Our solution is different from other online coding environments in two main ways. First, we are focused on APIs/SDKs. We are building features to allow developers to quickly play, test, and learn about <i>products</i> instead of providing a fully featured IDE like most other solutions. Second, we give API companies a white-label solution, so they do not have to send clients to another platform to play with their product. This is what Hyperbeam did with their Show HN mentioned above (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32598062\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32598062</a>). As that example shows, it allows for a more seamless solution all around.<p>Since we want devs to be able to experiment with examples with no initial setup, we decided to build our own web-based editor with Next.js, Monaco, and Sandpack. We built the UI with Next.js, which provides us fast load times with hybrid static and server-side rendering. We use Monaco for the code editor portion, which allows us to integrate VScode-like features such as language servers. With Sandpack we can take advantage of hot module reloading and npm dependency support.<p>Currently we only offer web based examples, but runtimes like Python and Node are coming soon. Right now, we host the application ourselves and provide a widget which companies can embed on their docs/website/anywhere. In the future, companies will be able to access a complete white label version of our web app that they can host and integrate seamlessly into their existing developer experience. As for pricing, we are charging a flat rate per month for web environments but once we implement runtimes, we will switch to usage-based pricing.<p>If you want to learn more about SideGuide please check us out at <a href=\"https://www.sideguide.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sideguide.dev/</a>.

Today Creative still sells soundcards, but none of them appear to be substantial improvements over previous models.<p>So what other reasons could have caused the decline in interest? Was there nothing that could be improved upon? Were there improvements on the software side that made hardware redundant and/or useless?

marketing for restaurants", "description": "<p>Hey HN, we are Shane and Mikey, the co-founders of Boostly (<a href=\"https://boostly.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://boostly.com</a>). Boostly is a text marketing and feedback system for restaurants that works seamlessly with their point of sale, online ordering, and phone systems.<p>Restaurants live or die based on their ability to keep their customers coming back. However, with the rise of the third party delivery platforms, which charge 20%-35% commission on each transaction, restaurants are afraid that many of their customers will stop ordering directly from the restaurant (even if the restaurant can do their own delivery), and wipe out their small profit margins.<p>The delivery platforms also maintain ownership of the customer data. They know how valuable this is for marketing, whereas the typical restaurant owner is focused on the food and service, as they should be\u2014and they miss out on being able to communicate directly with their guest as a result. With so many restaurants hanging by a thread these days, it\u2019s more important than ever that they be able to market to their customers themselves, build relationships, and get their customers to order through their most profitable channels.<p>Customer data is notoriously hard for restaurant owners to access because it is scattered across different systems with various challenges. Even if they access it, they don\u2019t have a way to manage opt-in consent for texting. And of course, most restaurant owners are non-technical and so none of this stuff is easy for them to begin with. We help restaurants access their data, get people opted-in to receive text marketing, and then put it all on autopilot.<p>All of this started when I (Shane) was running sales for Jolt, a restaurant operations software company, and saw the early stages of online ordering trends. Everyone was focused on the transactions, while customer data was largely getting neglected. Our insight was that this was leaving an incredible amount of opportunity on the table\u2014to turn online ordering into a marketing tool for the restaurant, instead of just being an order taker.<p>Initially, we founded the company as an online ordering system with a few marketing and feedback tools. We thought that the only way for us to access the customer information would be to own the transaction. We sold that online ordering system to StrideQ, and through that experience we learned how to access customer data from the restaurant's point of sale, online ordering, and other systems. We\u2019ve built Boostly's current tools to put that data to work for the restaurant.<p>Essentially, we work with the restaurant's point of sale, online ordering, and phone systems to ask for opt-in consent for the customer to receive marketing texts. For example, when ordering online, someone could check a box to opt in to receive marketing texts. Or when someone calls the store, one of the prompts that they can select is to \u201cPress 1 to join our text club and get 10% off today\u2019s order.\u201d Once we have the customer\u2019s permission, we put text marketing on autopilot for the restaurant, so that they can send weekly offers, birthday deals, and other reminders to their opted-in subscribers. We then track the usage so that a restaurant knows exactly how much revenue they drove through their text marketing campaigns.<p>Additionally, we collect feedback on the customer's experience and give an easy option to leave a review or to give internal feedback to the restaurant that the restaurant can use to resolve issues in real time and get the customer to come back and re-order.<p>I know some of this might sound a bit spammy, by HN\u2019s demanding standards\u2014one key thing we help the restaurants understand is that it\u2019s in their interest not to over-text their customers. We are scrupulously opt-in, focused on asking politely for permission, and making sure that restaurants set the right expectations for how many texts the customers should expect.<p>Here\u2019s a quick video that shows a bit about how it works: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nG2iSFCnP7Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/nG2iSFCnP7Q</a><p>There are a ton of SMS marketing companies out there. Five things differentiate us and make us good for restaurants in particular: (1) Ability to opt-in customers through point of sale, online ordering, and phone systems; (2) Fully automated experience; (3) ROI tracking; (4) Collect feedback on the customer's experience with the ability to resolve issues in real-time; (5) Giving customers an easy way to leave public reviews, without them feeling pressured to do so.<p>With your typical text marketing system, the only way to join is to text a keyword to a phone number. Also there is no automation, so as a restaurant owner, I have to go in and schedule every text that I want to go out. With Boostly, since we work with the restaurant's existing systems, we can facilitate opt-ins in real-time without customers having to text a keyword\u2014for example we can ask them \u201cDo you want to join our text club and receive offers from us\u201d at the time that they order food. Also, it's completely automated (they can set up 6+ offers and it automatically rotates through those offers each week). Additionally, we collect feedback, encourage reviews on Google, and are able to track exactly how much revenue was generated through those offers (most texting services can\u2019t do this).<p>As far as reviews go, we give everyone the opportunity to leave a review, including if they have a negative experience. What we do is also give the ability to send internal feedback to the restaurant, and then make it easy for the restaurant to respond and hopefully resolve the issue. This is good for both the customer and the restaurant, and we think it\u2019s a much nicer solution than trying to just pump positive reviews or suppress negative ones. Most restaurants want to know when something isn\u2019t right, and they especially want to be able to fix the problem so that they can keep you as a repeat customer. The review platforms make it hard to initiate a direct conversation with the customer (especially if you\u2019re not eating in the restaurant (i.e. takeout or delivery), so in the end, nobody wins.<p>Our pricing model is simple: we have a pay-for-what-you-use approach. Restaurants pay $0.08 / SMS and an additional $0.04  / MMS (includes a picture and/or more than 160 characters). We want to earn the restaurant's business every month, so there aren't contracts, unless the restaurant decides to commit to specific monthly texting volumes in exchange for a discount. We have over 400 restaurants using our system so far.<p>Running an independent restaurant is getting harder and harder as non-technical proprietors are getting squeezed by Big Delivery, inflation, and staff shortages. We think that helping them build better direct relationships with their customers, and getting that relationship right for both sides, is one thing that can really help here.<p>We\u2019d love to hear your feedback as well as to hear about any experiences that you\u2019ve personally had with text marketing that you wish had been different. Many of us have been on the receiving end of poorly executed SMS marketing campaigns, and we are sure that we can learn from your experiences to continue to help restaurants do it right for their customers! And if any of you have experience in the restaurant business, we\u2019d also love to hear about your thoughts or experiences from that side. Looking forward to the comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675658\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675658</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675658", "date_published": "2022-09-01 13:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Armies are re-learning how to fight in cities", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2022/08/17/armies-are-re-learning-how-to-fight-in-cities\">https://www.economist.com/international/2022/08/17/armies-are-re-learning-how-to-fight-in-cities</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675389\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675389</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 34</p>", "link": "https://www.economist.com/international/2022/08/17/armies-are-re-learning-how-to-fight-in-cities", "date_published": "2022-09-01 12:28:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Germany\u2019s ultra-cheap train ticket saved 1.8M tons of CO2", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/germany-s-ultra-cheap-train-ticket-saved-1-8-million-tons-of-co2\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/germany-s-ultra-cheap-train-ticket-saved-1-8-million-tons-of-co2</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675189\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675189</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/germany-s-ultra-cheap-train-ticket-saved-1-8-million-tons-of-co2", "date_published": "2022-09-01 12:05:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "SBX Robotics (YC W21) Is Hiring Techincal Artists in Toronto [Remote]", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3184745474/\">https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3184745474/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32675154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3184745474/", "date_published": "2022-09-01 12:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Arm sues Qualcomm, aiming to unwind Qualcomm's $1.4B Nuvia purchase", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/chips-tech-firm-arm-sues-qualcomm-nuvia-breach-license-trademark-2022-08-31/\">https://www.reuters.com/legal/chips-tech-firm-arm-sues-qualcomm-nuvia-breach-license-trademark-2022-08-31/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32674698\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32674698</a></p>\n<p>Points: 32</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/legal/chips-tech-firm-arm-sues-qualcomm-nuvia-breach-license-trademark-2022-08-31/", "date_published": "2022-09-01 11:05:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: Are authors of \u201chow to be great developer\u201d blogs great developers?", "description": "<p>Every time I am reading blog posts about \"how to become a great developer\", or \"what\u00b4s the difference between a good and a great developer\", I am marvelling the self-confidence of the author.
