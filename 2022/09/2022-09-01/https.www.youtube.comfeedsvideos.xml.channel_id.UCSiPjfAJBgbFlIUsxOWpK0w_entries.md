LYRICS
Love can take a sudden turn
And as much as I love to learn
I’d prefer to have you near again
Warming up my morning
Oooo darling
Tell me I’m the one

Cause I don’t wanna spend
Every second day of my life
Wondering
If I could have done better
I don’t wanna spend
Every second day of my life
Wondering
If I could have done something more
Oooo

Honey you’re a wild one
It’d be easier to hold the sun
But where else could I go from here
When every stellar arrow points to you darling
Tell me I’m the one

Cause I don’t wanna spend
Every second day of my life
Wondering
If I could have done better
I don’t wanna spend
Every second day of my life
Wondering
If I could have done something more
Oooo

Like it was before
Like it was before
One more time
One more time
