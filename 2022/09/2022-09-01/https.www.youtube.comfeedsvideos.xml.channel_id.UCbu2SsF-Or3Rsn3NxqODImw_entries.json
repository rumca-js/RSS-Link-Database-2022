If you didn\u2019t get a chance to experience these fun homages and legendary tales, here\u2019s 10 things you didn\u2019t know about The Last of Us.\n\nWarning these can be pretty spoiler heavy, so proceed with caution.\n#gaming #thelastofus #gamespot #naughtydog \n\nStu here to spot the references and hidden details throughout the world of The Last of Us. Although known for crafting some of the most immersive worlds through their storytelling and stunning (as well as horrifying) visuals; Naughty Dog has spared no expense when it comes to their secrets. Spanning both games, Naughty Dog has sneakily hidden a ton of in-references, along with other fun connections to the greater world outside of Joel and Ellie's zombie stricken landscape. These secrets don\u2019t necessarily jump out at you to take you away from the moment to moment action, but rather they fill in the gaps and make the world immensely rich and layered experience. From Hotline Miami to AC/DC to legends of the outbreak, stick around to see how deep these secrets go. \n\n00:00 Intro\n00:24 Music To My Ears\n03:21 Get Your Eyes Checked, Kid\n03:38 Well Read\n04:46 The Naughty Dog - Verse\n06:19 Don't Stop Me Now\n06:33 Not Today Capitalism\n06:55 The Legend Of Ish\n08:29 Movie Magic\n09:39 The 0451 Code\n10:13 The Last of Us: Vice\n10:33 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cp99e07mPo", "date_published": "2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Reveal Planned Amid Expansion Rumors | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, DeVante refreshes your memory on the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion rumors before the future of the game is officially revealed next week.\n#GamingNews #Cyberpunk2077 #GamePass \n\nCD Projekt Red says that it will reveal \"what's next\" for Cyberpunk 2077 in a livestream next week. Alongside its game, the company will also share some new information on the Cyberpunk Edgerunners series coming to Netflix soon that had a very NSFW trailer recently.\u00a0\n\nThis new Night City episode will be streamed at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET on September 6, but while we wait for that, let\u2019s go over the story details for the upcoming expansion that appeared to have leaked online back in May 2022.\u00a0\n\nAccording to VGC, which saw the leaked files and first reported on them, hundreds of lines of dialogue spelling out most of the events and characters of the expansion have appeared online. The dialogue points to a character named Songbird, who was datamined in Cyberpunk 2077, being the focus of the DLC. The expansion will reportedly take players to the Combat Zone and Sports Dome, which were both previously inaccessible spots across Cyberpunk 2077's setting Night City.\n\nWhile the side missions seem to mostly contain placeholder text, enough of the dialogue throughout shows that Johnny Silverhand, an AI of a rockstar played by Keanu Reeves, may have a more diminished presence in the expansion, though it's unknown exactly why that may be the case. That may come as a disappointment and shocker to many fans of Cyberpunk 2077, since Reeves' involvement was a major selling point for the game and a significant part of the title's marketing efforts once it re-emerged in 2019.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:09 - Cyberpunk 2077\n01:53 - Xbox Game Pass", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URLcYgZgynE", "date_published": "2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "GameSpot Swipe Mobile Showcase - What to Expect", "description": "Tune in for Swipe, GameSpot\u2019s first ever mobile games showcase.

Unfortunately, that confirmation is all we\u2019re getting today and the company has said more details will be shared during the September 10th Ubisoft Forward. For the time being we can look to the leaked information for a decent picture of what to expect. \n\nMirage will reportedly star Basim, a character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, in his youth, leading up to when he arrived at the Hidden Ones. The game will do away with dialogue choices and the ability to select a gender. The game will reportedly take place in Baghdad in late '800s and will also be a \"return to basics\" for the series with no leveling.This back-to-basics approach is inspired by 2007\u2019s original Assassin's Creed; a game that Ubisoft is allegedly working on a remake for. This alleged remake will be part of Mirage's season pass, and there will also be Constantinople DLC. According to reports, Mirage will launch in Spring 2023. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re a Nintendo fan then you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the week of September 12. A source told Jeff Grubb of our sister site Giant Bomb that the next Nintendo Direct may be held in that week. Grubb discussed the possibilities with Mike Minotti of GamesBeat and Mike said the rumored event will include the announcement of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess ports for Nintendo Switch. Both games were already updated on Wii U, but they haven't been re-released on Switch yet. Whether or not this is a general Nintendo Direct that includes details on franchises outside of Zelda remains to be seen. Grubb went on to say that a Metroid Prime remaster is also in the works and could be announced at an upcoming Nintendo Direct.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage\n01:33 - September Nintendo Direct\n02:29 - Halo Infinite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhlfTTUabI", "date_published": "2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn Mashes Up Sekiro And God of War Combat", "description": "Sekiro meets God of War in A44's Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, the developer's follow up to their previous game, Ashen.\n#gaming #flintlock #gamespot\n\nMechanically, Flintlock's combat sort of looks like how you fight in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with an armor system that works in a similar manner to Sekiro's posture.\n\nIn Flintlock, enemies have two different meters that you have to worry about while in combat. The red bar is an enemy's health, while the yellow bar above that is their armor. The yellow bar fills as you damage an enemy's armor while the red bar empties as you damage the enemy themselves.\n\nAttacks deal damage, while both attacks and parries chip away at an enemy's armor. When the armor bar is filled, protagonist Nor is able to land a devastating execution attack against her foe. In most cases against normal enemies, it looks like these executions kill her targets outright. \n\nHowever, stronger enemies and bosses can seemingly withstand multiple versions of these attacks. They're still worth doing though, because when it comes to these more powerful targets, Nor can use this execution attack to rip away an enemy's literal armor, like a shield or breastplate, that makes them more vulnerable to your attacks.\n\nIn Flintlock, an enemy's armor meter begins to deplete if you back off, encouraging you to be aggressive in combat and rely on parries and dodges instead of blocks. In combat, you can combat Nor's companion, Enki, to stun enemies and stop their armor meter from depleting, but it looks like you can only do this to one enemy at a time.\n\nNor has armor too. Powerful attacks, like unblockable attacks that are symbolized by a red aura, can cut into that armor and damage it. Once it's broken, Nor takes increased damage from enemy attacks. Thankfully, there's a way to replenish Nor's armor, which leads us into our next point.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDzWHqDFZPc", "date_published": "2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Pok\u00e9mon Violet | Introducing Grafaiai Trailer", "description": "Let\u2019s meet a newly-discovered Pok\u00e9mon: Grafaiai.
