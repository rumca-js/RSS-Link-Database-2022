Stu here to spot the references and hidden details throughout the world of The Last of Us. Although known for crafting some of the most immersive worlds through their storytelling and stunning (as well as horrifying) visuals; Naughty Dog has spared no expense when it comes to their secrets. Spanning both games, Naughty Dog has sneakily hidden a ton of in-references, along with other fun connections to the greater world outside of Joel and Ellie's zombie stricken landscape. These secrets don’t necessarily jump out at you to take you away from the moment to moment action, but rather they fill in the gaps and make the world immensely rich and layered experience. From Hotline Miami to AC/DC to legends of the outbreak, stick around to see how deep these secrets go.

## Cyberpunk 2077 Reveal Planned Amid Expansion Rumors | GameSpot News

In this episode of GameSpot News, DeVante refreshes your memory on the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion rumors before the future of the game is officially revealed next week.
#GamingNews #Cyberpunk2077 #GamePass 

CD Projekt Red says that it will reveal "what's next" for Cyberpunk 2077 in a livestream next week. Alongside its game, the company will also share some new information on the Cyberpunk Edgerunners series coming to Netflix soon that had a very NSFW trailer recently. 

This new Night City episode will be streamed at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET on September 6, but while we wait for that, let’s go over the story details for the upcoming expansion that appeared to have leaked online back in May 2022. 

According to VGC, which saw the leaked files and first reported on them, hundreds of lines of dialogue spelling out most of the events and characters of the expansion have appeared online. The dialogue points to a character named Songbird, who was datamined in Cyberpunk 2077, being the focus of the DLC. The expansion will reportedly take players to the Combat Zone and Sports Dome, which were both previously inaccessible spots across Cyberpunk 2077's setting Night City.

While the side missions seem to mostly contain placeholder text, enough of the dialogue throughout shows that Johnny Silverhand, an AI of a rockstar played by Keanu Reeves, may have a more diminished presence in the expansion, though it's unknown exactly why that may be the case. That may come as a disappointment and shocker to many fans of Cyberpunk 2077, since Reeves' involvement was a major selling point for the game and a significant part of the title's marketing efforts once it re-emerged in 2019.

## Assassin’s Creed Mirage Confirmed - Trailer At Ubisoft Forward? | GameSpot News

Assassin’s Creed Mirage has been confirmed, Zelda remake rumors have surfaced again and a Halo Infinite’s couch co-op has been canceled.
#GamingNews #AssassinsCreed #HaloInfinite 

Following a handful of leaks, Ubisoft has officially announced the next game in the Assassin’s Creed series:Mirage. Unfortunately, that confirmation is all we’re getting today and the company has said more details will be shared during the September 10th Ubisoft Forward. For the time being we can look to the leaked information for a decent picture of what to expect. 

Mirage will reportedly star Basim, a character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, in his youth, leading up to when he arrived at the Hidden Ones. The game will do away with dialogue choices and the ability to select a gender. The game will reportedly take place in Baghdad in late '800s and will also be a "return to basics" for the series with no leveling.This back-to-basics approach is inspired by 2007’s original Assassin's Creed; a game that Ubisoft is allegedly working on a remake for. This alleged remake will be part of Mirage's season pass, and there will also be Constantinople DLC. According to reports, Mirage will launch in Spring 2023. 

And if you’re a Nintendo fan then you’ll want to pay attention to the week of September 12. A source told Jeff Grubb of our sister site Giant Bomb that the next Nintendo Direct may be held in that week. Grubb discussed the possibilities with Mike Minotti of GamesBeat and Mike said the rumored event will include the announcement of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess ports for Nintendo Switch. Both games were already updated on Wii U, but they haven't been re-released on Switch yet. Whether or not this is a general Nintendo Direct that includes details on franchises outside of Zelda remains to be seen. Grubb went on to say that a Metroid Prime remaster is also in the works and could be announced at an upcoming Nintendo Direct.

## Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn Mashes Up Sekiro And God of War Combat

Sekiro meets God of War in A44's Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, the developer's follow up to their previous game, Ashen.
#gaming #flintlock #gamespot

Mechanically, Flintlock's combat sort of looks like how you fight in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with an armor system that works in a similar manner to Sekiro's posture.

In Flintlock, enemies have two different meters that you have to worry about while in combat. The red bar is an enemy's health, while the yellow bar above that is their armor. The yellow bar fills as you damage an enemy's armor while the red bar empties as you damage the enemy themselves.

Attacks deal damage, while both attacks and parries chip away at an enemy's armor. When the armor bar is filled, protagonist Nor is able to land a devastating execution attack against her foe. In most cases against normal enemies, it looks like these executions kill her targets outright. 

However, stronger enemies and bosses can seemingly withstand multiple versions of these attacks. They're still worth doing though, because when it comes to these more powerful targets, Nor can use this execution attack to rip away an enemy's literal armor, like a shield or breastplate, that makes them more vulnerable to your attacks.

In Flintlock, an enemy's armor meter begins to deplete if you back off, encouraging you to be aggressive in combat and rely on parries and dodges instead of blocks. In combat, you can combat Nor's companion, Enki, to stun enemies and stop their armor meter from depleting, but it looks like you can only do this to one enemy at a time.

Nor has armor too. Powerful attacks, like unblockable attacks that are symbolized by a red aura, can cut into that armor and damage it. Once it's broken, Nor takes increased damage from enemy attacks. Thankfully, there's a way to replenish Nor's armor, which leads us into our next point.

Let’s meet a newly-discovered Pokémon: Grafaiai. This Toxic Monkey Pokémon uses its poisonous saliva – which changes color depending on what the Pokémon eats – to attack foes by spitting at them.

Grafaiai is a moody Pokémon with a fastidious disposition. It doesn’t form packs, preferring to roam alone, and it is constantly caught up in territorial struggles with other Pokémon. Grafaiai specializes in using its poisonous saliva—which changes color depending on what the Pokémon eats—to attack foes by spitting at them or by slashing at them after coating its claws with the saliva.
 
Grafaiai is nocturnal and once the sun sets it licks its hands and fingers to cover them in poison and uses them to draw patterns on the trees in its territory. The poisonous saliva it uses to paint paralyzes Bug Pokémon, which are drawn to the saliva’s sweet, fragrant scent.

The Last of Us is an excellent game, but is the $70 dollar remake worth you time and money? Jake Dekker breaks down out all the new additions and shares his thoughts on Naughty Dog's controversial remake.

In this video Jake breaks down everything from the improved visuals to the new extra features. There's a lot here, but if you've already played The Last of Us, and the story didn't do much for you, then maybe you should wait.

Fans will really appreciate all the new improvements though. The sound design in particular is really great. The clickers are more terrifying, the gunshots ring in your ears, and the combat sounds more impactful.

The Last of Us Part I comes to PlayStation 5 on September 2nd. If you want to check out raw 4K gameplay of the opening scene, stop by our YouTube channel and let us know what you think.
