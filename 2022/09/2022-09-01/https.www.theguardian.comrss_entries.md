<p>Can you ever buy a decent wine for a fiver? And how much is too much to spend on a bottle? A wine industry pro shares his advice on how to get the best value for your money</p><p>There’s a lot of hyperbole surrounding the “proper” cost of wine. Some people insist that procuring quality wine means spending money hand over fist, while others are wedded to ordering the second-least expensive bottle on the menu. And once you take into account production costs and tax, the maths behind how much of your hard-earned money is actually going towards the wine you’re drinking can feel quite murky.</p><p>But what do the experts say? Here, Julian Dyer, UK chief operating officer for Australia’s McGuigan Wines, clears away some of the myths attached to buying a delicious drop that won’t break the bank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/on-my-terms/2022/sep/01/putting-a-price-on-it-how-much-should-a-good-bottle-of-wine-really-cost">Continue reading...</a>

## Eating meat isn’t a crime against the planet – if it’s done right | Thomasina Miers

<p>George Monbiot criticised ‘chefs and foodies’ like me for focusing on regenerative grazing. But alternative, lab-grown foods, could have terrible consequences</p><p>I have huge admiration for George Monbiot, a columnist of this newspaper. His work has highlighted the urgent need to reduce our CO2 emissions and switch to greener energy. He has also shown intensive farming’s role in the dramatic levels of species decline and biodiversity loss. Much of what he writes I wholeheartedly agree with – but when it comes to the solutions we need to change our farming and food systems, we have radically different takes.</p><p>It is indisputable that the farming “revolution” of the 1950s, with its widespread use of ammonia fertilisers and herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, has waged war on nature. These intensive, monocultural ways of producing food are not only contaminating our land and waterways, but are heating up our planet and contributing to a crisis in human health (more people die of diet-related disease globally than smoking, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30041-8/fulltext">according to a study</a> published in the Lancet). The animals in factory farms don’t have a great time either. The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/68-average-decline-in-species-population-sizes-since-1970-says-new-wwf-report">decline</a> of insect life is incredibly worrying: without the earthworm, beetle and bee, life as we know it could cease.

<p>BikePark Wales offers the UK’s longest beginner trail – 5km – and a great introduction to downhill mountain biking. Our writer and her family try it out</p><p></p><p>The Vicious Valley trail starts with a terrifying half-metre drop off a wooden boardwalk. Like all the advanced runs at BikePark Wales in the Brecon Beacons national park, it begins with a qualifier, that is a tricky opening feature where you can check whether you’re good enough for the trail and, if not, bale out in favour of an easier alternative.</p><p>At the urging of my sons, who are nine and 11, Harry Lewis, one of our two guides, executes a perfect demonstration of how to ride the drop. Namely by jumping off as high as he can. The kids whoop; my husband raises an eyebrow. Then to our great relief, Harry leads us to the new Kermit trail, designed to provide an altogether less intimidating introduction to downhill mountain biking (though at 5km it’s the UK’s longest beginner trail).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/sep/01/mountain-bike-trail-bikepark-wales-brecon-beacons">Continue reading...</a>

## When did everything become ‘awesome’ and ‘amazing’? I blame the Americans

<p>A simple ‘thanks’ doesn’t cut it any more, even if you’ve just been given a tin of cat food</p><p><br /></p><p>“Amazing!” she said, as I handed her a tin of cat food. This was the young woman who looks after my neighbour’s cat when he’s away. I was running an errand. It’s nice to be appreciated, but the routine handing over of a tin of cat food is not, in anyone’s book, amazing. What if I’d bought half a dozen tins of cat food? How much more amazing would that have been? Or a dozen tins, a cat bed, a scratching post, and £500 in cash? “Amazing!” wouldn’t cut it; I suppose an “absolutely” would have had to go in front of it. If I threw in some high-end cat treats, I suppose that would necessitate doubling up the adverbs, with a “completely” or some such.</p><p>Where is language going? Once upon a time there would have been a “thanks” or “thank you” for the cat food. Bigger gestures might elicit a “thank you very much” and, on special occasions, a “thank you very much indeed” might have been wheeled out. Now the game’s gone, I tell you. We go straight to “amazing”. Or “awesome”. In both cases, as usual, I think we’re on safe ground blaming the Americans. They too, surely, are behind “thank you <em>so </em>much”. It’s now used so often that the “so much” adds nothing; it’s just a standard thank you.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/01/when-did-everything-become-awesome-and-amazing-i-blame-the-americans">Continue reading...</a>

Late and returned payment fees are mounting up. After visits to our branch, and several letters, we still have no information on reinstatement. We are both 85 and becoming stressed.<br /></strong><em><strong>PG, Bury, Lancashire</strong></em></p><p>This is a bizarre situation and the bank’s apparent indifference to the emergency is troubling. Your credit record could be trashed by a succession of missed payments. And I – and you – are still in the dark about what happened, and why. It appears to have been a bank error rather than fraud. However, within a day of my intervention, you were contacted by the chief executive’s office and your account was reinstated.

<p>At 84, Oates still knows how to strike a nerve. She talks about Babysitter – her new book inspired by a Detroit serial killer – loneliness and her controversial tweet about white male writers</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is on her feet in her study, looking out over woodland in rural Princeton, New Jersey, while her maine coon, Zanche, sprawls atop a swanky white cat tower. We are speaking on video and Oates pans around the room – large, book-lined – to show me it. She lets the camera linger on Zanche, who is amply provided for – she also has her own “catio” garden. “She hopes we won’t interfere with her nap,” Oates says, in a voice that sounds mildly warning. She is friendly, but not in a way that makes her less forbidding.</p><p>We are speaking before the publication of her novel Babysitter, inspired by a serial killer who murdered children in the 1970s in the suburbs of Detroit, where Oates lived at the time. She is 84, but her work remains exceptionally relevant. The film adaptation of her 2000 novel Blonde, a fictionalised account of the life of Marilyn Monroe and “the most difficult novel” she has written, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/marilyn-monroe-abiding-obsession-biopic-blonde">to be released on Netflix next month</a>, while Babysitter is unflinching in its detailing of sexual assault before the #MeToo era. According to her publisher, it is Oates’ 61st novel, although no one seems certain, least of all Oates. She waves away the question as if counting is for people who have nothing better to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/01/every-time-i-write-its-like-the-first-time-joyce-carol-oates-on-her-61-novels-twitter-storms-and-widowhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When a Romanian businessman returned to his hometown and found a city blighted by mining waste, he hatched a plan to restore it to its former glory. He became a local hero, but now prosecutors accuse of him a running a multimillion dollar fraud</p><p>The first time I heard the name Daniel Boldor, I was in Bucharest in a room full of police officers. A discussion about wealthy countries shipping their waste to poorer countries had turned to what Romania – one of the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/romania-the-billion-dollar-illegal-trash-industry/av-61692495" title="">major recipients</a> of Europe’s trash – was doing to fight back. Strict surveillance was being conducted at ports, the officers affirmed, and cargo trucks were undergoing checks. And then one of the policemen asked if I had ever heard the story of Daniel Boldor. For a moment, his colleagues awkwardly scanned the floor<strong> </strong>with their eyes, as if the officer had made some kind of gaffe. Yes, they seemed to eventually nod in agreement, a sense of enthusiasm overtaking the table. It was an extraordinary story.</p><p>It sounded like a fairytale. Some years earlier, hundreds of miles north of Bucharest, deep in the mountains of Transylvania, a Roma man claimed to have discovered a great lost treasure: thousands of tonnes of gold and copper that had been dug up decades earlier, then forgotten. His name was Daniel Boldor, and he had a plan. He found investors across the world. He paid his fellow Roma to gather the metal for him. Then he began selling his treasure.
