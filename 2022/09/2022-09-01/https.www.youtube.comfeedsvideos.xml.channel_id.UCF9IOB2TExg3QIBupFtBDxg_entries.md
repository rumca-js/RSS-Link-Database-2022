Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Fertility and early embryonic development and embryofoetal development

A combined fertility and developmental study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) in rats is ongoing.

Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function

No such studies have been done.

Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated

No such studies have been done.

Local tolerance

No such studies have been done. 

The assessments made as part of the general toxicity study should suffice and a separate study is not needed.

Other toxicity studies

No such studies have been done.

Toxicity conclusions

The absence of reproductive toxicity data is a reflection of the speed of development to first identify and select COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 for clinical testing and its rapid development to meet the ongoing urgent health need. 

In principle, a decision on licensing a vaccine could be taken in these circumstances without data from reproductive toxicity studies animals, 

but there are studies ongoing and these will be provided when available. 

In the context of supply under Regulation 174, 

it is considered that sufficient reassurance of safe use of the vaccine in pregnant women cannot be provided at the present time: 

however, use in women of childbearing potential could be supported,

provided healthcare professionals are advised to rule out known or suspected pregnancy prior to vaccination. 

Women who are breastfeeding should also not be vaccinated.

Specific population groups

Pregnancy 

There is no known risk associated with giving inactivated, recombinant viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids during pregnancy or whilst breastfeeding (Kroger et al, 2013). 

Developmental and reproductivity testing of the Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines in animals have not raised any concerns. 

JCVI has therefore advised that women who are pregnant should be recommended to receive primary immunisation, 

and that pregnancy is considered a clinical risk group for the autumn booster programme. 

Routine questioning about last menstrual period and/or pregnancy testing is not required before offering the vaccine. 

Surveillance of the inadvertent administration of COVID-19 vaccines in early pregnancy is being conducted for the UK by the UK Health Security Agency Immunisation and Vaccine Preventable Diseases Division, to whom such cases should be reported.1 

This surveillance is being undertaken to document safety in women who unknowingly receive a vaccine in early pregnancy

Breastfeeding 

There is no known risk associated with being given a non-live vaccine whilst breastfeeding. 

JCVI advises that breastfeeding women should be offered any suitable COVID-19 vaccine.

Risk of BA.5 Infection among Persons Exposed to Previous SARS-CoV-2 Variants

Omicron subvariants, BA.1 and BA.2, displaced by BA.5 in many countries

Greater transmissibility

Partial evasion of BA.1- and BA.2-induced immunity

Portugal, one of the first countries affected by a BA.5 predominance

N = 9,307,996

All Portuguese residents aged 12 years and older, (National Census 2021) 

Uninfected people in June 1st 2022 was 5, 328, 287, (57% of the Portuguese population over 12)
 
(PCR tests and rapid antigen tests to diagnose cases) 

Presence of undocumented infections among the “uninfected” group of individuals 

29.2% of infections were not notified

(based on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG in the population) 

National coronavirus disease 2019 registry (SINAVE)

(all reported cases in the country, regardless of clinical presentation)

To calculate the risk of BA.5 infection after documented infection with past variants, 

including BA.1 and BA.2

Times when different variants represented more than 90% of the isolates

To calculate their infection risk during the period of BA.5 dominance

Pooled BA.1 and BA.2 (slow transition between the two subvariants)

Comparator group

Population that did not have any documented infection before BA.5 dominance (June 1, 2022)

Results

Wuhan-Hu-1  55.7%

Alpha   58.8%

Delta   64.5%

BA.1 / BA.2 7 6.8%

We found that previous SARS-CoV-2 infection had a protective effect against BA.5 infection

Protection was maximal for previous infection with BA.1 or BA.2 (not suprising)

Context

Portugal more than 98% of the study population completed the primary vaccination series before 2022

There is a perception that the protection afforded by previous BA.1 or BA.2 infection is very low, given the high number of BA.5 infections among persons with previous BA.1 or BA.2 infection. 

Our data indicate that this perception is probably a consequence of the larger pool of persons with BA.1 or BA.2 infection than with infection by other subvariants, and it is not supported by the data.

Breakthrough infections with the BA.5 subvariant were less likely among persons with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection history … especially for previous BA.1 or BA.2 infection, than among uninfected persons.
