RRR, an Indian action movie directed by S. S. Rajamouli, was the kind of movie I didn't expect great things from. But as it turns out, it was a fantastically realised story of friendship, loyalty, betrayal, redemption and revolution. And it's better than 95% of the garbage being churned out over here.
