Here we not only have that, but this feckless educator also admits to hating a particular group of her students. Meet Jennifer Norris. As of this writing, she is still employed by posh and private Trinity School in New York City. So, not only are parents paying lots of money for their kids to be indoctrinated, they are paying for them to be verbally abused, as well.</p><p>This is the latest rabble roused by <a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/news/prestigious-nyc-private-school-director-touts-sneaking-her-political-agenda/" target="_blank">Project Veritas</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>She hits all the bases of being a leftist douche. We're close to the point where there's a 50% chance the teacher is a wannabe political activist without needing a hidden video as evidence. But what makes Jenny a number one and top of the heap is the hatred she has for white boys.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it’s the white boys who feel very entitled to express their opposite opinions and just push back. There’s a huge contingent of them that are just horrible. And you’re like, ‘Are you always going to be horrible or are you just going to be horrible right now?’ Don’t know…I think they need to go. I think they’re really awful people…They’re so protected by capitalism. It makes me sad.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Damn those white boys thinking they can express an opinion in school! We've always been incorrigible that way.</p><p>This is the second in PV's series on exposing teachers. The first video <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/assistant-principal-greenwwich" target="_blank">featured an assistant principal </a>who admitted to religious discrimination. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-woke-assistant-principal" target="_blank">He's been put on leave</a>. Jenny works in NYC, so my money is on her doubling down and claiming her hatred was taken out of context.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

The White House is actually attempting to rewrite history by blaming Biden's predecessor for the school shutdowns while claiming Democrats fought to keep schools open. I mean, I can believe it.

Now, Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing has been activated.</p><p>To recap, the Podcast Movement is a major podcast conference. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=daily+wire" target="_blank">The Daily Wire</a>, which produces podcasts and inferior drinking vessels (and Michael Knowles for some reason), was in attendance. So, Ben Shapiro decided to show up and take a few photos with fans. The conference organizers, or whoever runs their Twitter account, <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-podcast-conference-apologizes" target="_blank">went berserk</a>. <em>"In 9 wonderful years growing and celebrating this medium, PM has made mistakes. The pain caused by this one will always stick with us. We promise that sponsors will be more carefully considered moving forward."</em></p><p>Yes, the pain of Ben Shapiro walking into a lobby. We all had a good laugh over the silliness at first.

</p><p>On a follow-up call, the Podcast Movement told Boreing that they don't do politics, and therein lied the problem with Ben Shapiro being in the same building.

## NYC Mayor says he'll send cops door-to-door, ask neighbors if you're good enough for a concealed carry permit

Their last batch of gun laws was ruled unconstitutional. This new batch of unconstitutional laws is a response to that. To paraphrase Kathy Hochul, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-doesnt-need-numbers" target="_blank">she don't need no stinkin' facts to violate your second amendment</a>. The new rules include handing over your social media accounts, putting up <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/times-square-gun-free-zone" target="_blank">"Gun-Free Zone" signs in Times Square</a>, and if NYC Mayor Eric Adams has his druthers, sending police door-to-door to investigate you for wanting a handgun.</p><p>Earlier this year, a ruling from the Supreme Court ordered that states could no longer require concealed carry permit applicants to prove they had “proper cause” for wanting a gun. Now, if you want one, <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/juliorosas/2022/09/01/new-yorkers-who-want-a-conceal-carry-permit-could-get-a-visit-from-the-police-n2612536" target="_blank">according to Eric Adams on a recent MSNBC appearance</a>, expect the police to come a-knockin'.</p><p><em>"If someone is spewing hate, if someone is making dangerous threats, if someone is part of some form of hate group, the police officer, or the detective, or the investigator is going to use their investigatory skills of determining if there is something that is a red flag there."</em></p><p>The rub is all the people who work in New York City that would determine red flags? Partisan leftists who think any opinion they disagree with is "hate." If you think half-naked grown men shouldn't be dancing with little children? HATE! If you question the science behind allowing people to protest and riot but not allow them the visit dying relatives? HATE! If you think Kathy Hochul is a dingbat and Eric Adams looks like a foreskin that was left out in the sun too long? HATE!</p><p>Oh, and your neighbors are going to get a knock on the door, too:</p><p><em>'When I became a police officer, people knocked on my neighbor’s doors and interviewed them and asked what type of person am I, and I think those are the same skills that are going to be used to look at not only social media, but also knocking on neighbor’s doors, speaking to people, finding out who this individual is, and that we’re about to allow to carry a firearm in our city."</em></p><p>Adams' plan is to have police (with guns) talk to your neighbors, tell them you would have a gun next door, and then ask them what they would think about you having a gun next door. And this idiot runs a city.</p><p>A city that, by the way, is overrun by crime. The Mayor of New York City isn't doing a damn thing about the criminals in his city. Now, he's going to have police distracted, treating YOU like one for wanting to protect yourself from the criminals.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Woke energy company locks customers out of setting their 'smart' thermostats and too bad if you don't like it

</p><p>Over the years we have seen the rise of "smart" appliances. People who are too lazy to push buttons the old fashion way pay for a service allowing them to control their appliances on their phone. It's all connected to a WiFi people don't own and is controlled by the company from which they bought the appliance. In this case, Xcel customers discovered that the company decide their A/C was turned down enough.</p><p>We haven't even gotten to the dumbest thing. It wasn't all customers who were locked out of setting their own thermostats. It was only customers who signed up for the service that allowed the company to do this.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Customers who sign control away for $25 a year can sometimes override the controls, but "on rare occasions, system emergencies may cause a control event that cannot be overridden." </p><p>The rare occasion in this case?

</p><p>This is a new trend of companies limiting services in order to control your behavior. Last month, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/car-loan-bank-gas-poweered" target="_blank">a bank announced they will no longer provide</a> loans to buy gas-powered cars because they have decided you should be buying electric vehicles instead. Though, as California just found out, during similar emergencies <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-electric-vehicles" target="_blank">you are also told not to charge your electric vehicles</a>.</p><p>The bank was from Australia, and we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website opined at the time that Americans need to pay attention because leftists in this country will pull the same Marxist crap if they are ever allowed to.

Leftists waving all manner of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teacher-american-flag-pride" target="_blank">ridiculously colored flags</a>, several of which have never before been seen. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/antifa-meets-frying-pan-guy" target="_blank">Antifa nerds </a>taking their soldier cosplaying to a new level, complete with ARs and sidearms. And three-hundred-plus pound drag queens performing for singles being thrown at them by children. My friends, we've seen things.</p><p>A handful of us at Louder with Crowder spent the day in Roanoke, Texas, a small town with a population of just over 8,000. A small town that didn't much appreciate a new business--one that had only just opened a handful of weeks ago--importing drag queens. And it wasn't because they hated gay people or drag queens but because they had chosen to perform their debauchery for children whose irresponsible and abusive parents chose to drag (pun intended) them there.</p><p>The dominant opinion of residents I spoke to predicted this small distillery <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woke-cafe-closes" target="_blank">isn't long for this world</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>I can say with absolute certainty that we have far more footage to show all of you.

They say there is nothing sexual about these performances. They say it's all <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-friendly-drag-show" target="_blank">family-friendly</a>. But then why is it so important for them to shake their a**es for small children? Why do they dress in leotards and revealing clothing if it isn't a sexualized performance? And since when did grown men performing in skirts to the musical stylings of Miley Cyrus become family-friendly?</p><p>It's all gross. It's enough to make one want to wash their eyes with acid (I know because I want to). And it's incredibly important for everyone to see what kind of people we're actually up against in this ideological war for the soul of the United States.</p><p><br /></p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p>

It tells the tale of an illustrator who runs afoul of transgender activists online for her science-based, pro-feminist views. Then you find out "Robert Galbraith" is the pseudonym for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=jk+rowling" target="_blank">JK Rowling</a>, and it appears the book is autobiographical.</p><p>Rowling used to be a progressive icon. Leftists who had never read any other book aside from <em>Harry Potter</em> would identify as one of the families in Potterworld to identify how they were standing up to Donald Trump. Then Rowling made the tactical error to side with feminists over the trans community, and everyone hates her now.</p><p>I can't confirm if the book was written for the sole purpose of trolling her haters. But if that was the case, pages and pages of fictional tweets are the way to go.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I realize JK Rowling's new novel might seem a little long at 1200 pages but a good portion of the space is taken up by fictitious mean tweets <a href="https://t.co/6xaH27fUUT">pic.twitter.com/6xaH27fUUT</a><br />— Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1565016240883728389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The fictional tweets follow a certain formula many tweets from left-wing activists follow: <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twitter-pipe-bomb" target="_blank">silly hashtags</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-trans-speak-out" target="_blank">made-up words</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twitter-death-threat" target="_blank">death threats</a>:</p><p><em>"if u for raped every time you said something dumb u'd be permanently full of cok"</em></p><p>I forgot the typos.</p><p><em>"shallow bitch"</em></p><p><em>"can someone tell that vile, mercenary bitch to take a dirt nap. #stoopfeedingFedwell #istandwithjosh</em></p><p><em>"honestly at this point the bitch can choke. all that.

</p><p>If I had a ginormous pile of f*ck you money--the kind that would allow me to write books as a joke, I'd write one to troll my haters, too. I never knew there was a new book or Robert Galbraith was a thing. As far as PR stunts go, this works.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Watch: White House says when they call MAGA Republicans 'semi-fascist,' they don't mean all of you

He's previewed the speech this week calling MAGA Republicans "semi-fascist," and repeating his throw-away line that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tells-african-american-audience-gop-ticket-would-put-them-back-in-chains/" target="_blank">gun rights activists won't survive if the government comes after them</a>. This is the same Joe Biden who has called people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_blank">who disagree with his federal takeover of elections racist</a>. And he's the same Joe Biden who told an audience of African-Americans that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tells-african-american-audience-gop-ticket-would-put-them-back-in-chains/" target="_blank">Mitt Romney would put them back in chains</a>. We'll circle back to that in a moment.</p><p>Most Democrats are content leveling their attack against Republican leaders and Republican leaders alone. Biden is going after Republican voters. BUT the White House swears Biden isn't making blanket statements against ALL Republican voters.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p><em>"Let me be very clear. It is not just Republican leadership, it is not just that blanket, right? He is talking about an extreme portion, an extreme part of the party."</em></p><p>I see. So, Joe Biden isn't talking about ALL Republicans. Just a PORTION of Republicans who he considers EXTREME. The question is what Republicans he doesn't find extreme.</p><p><em>"He was just in Maryland [...] and he talked about Gov. Larry Hogan, and how he is a conservative Republican who is not in that bucket."</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Ten bucks say if you asked the White House for a list, they would be able to name Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger... and no one else. Claims that Biden IS NOT making a blanket statement are complete bullplop. We've heard versions of this story before. "Good" Republicans are only the ones who don't speak up, don't disagree with the left too much, and otherwise have no backbone. Kinda like... Mitt Romney.</p><p>Mitt Romney was a "good" Republican. Until he ran for president and the left and the media (but I repeat myself) decided he was EXTREME and evil. A fact that few of us forget, as is evident by the left's least favorite mother Bethany Mandel going viral for this tweet.<br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">If I had to pinpoint a moment, when Mitt Romney spent his entire campaign being accused of killing Big Bird, building binders full of women, torturing the family dog, etc etc. <a href="https://t.co/XuXovM0gEF">https://t.co/XuXovM0gEF</a><br />— Bethany S.

You could straight up not like Donald Trump and wish he would go away. But if you support gun rights and a particular Supreme Court decision, hold Joe Biden's policies accountable for inflation and Americans struggling to make ends meet, think the border crisis is a serious issue, or in any way crack jokes about a man who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia" target="_blank">critics say is in the throes of dementia</a>, congratulations. You're still considered a MAGA Republican.</p><p>Yes.

Boland <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/assistant-principal-greenwwich" target="_blank">was caught on video admitting to discriminatory hiring practices</a> and using teachers to help push a political agenda on elementary school students. James O'Keefe, chief rouser of rabble at Project Veritas (the independent journalist organization that released the expose) tried to get a follow-up response from Boland. He was threatened with arrest for "trespassing" in a public place.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>In the video, Boland had said of his hiring practices, "The conservative teacher, who is stuck in her ways. I’ll never be able to fire her, and I’ll never be able to change her. If someone is raised hardcore Catholic, it’s like, they’re brainwashed--you can never change their mindset."</p><p>When it came to what critics call indoctrinating a captive audience of school children, Boland proclaimed, "More progressive teachers are actually more savvy about delivering a Democratic message without really ever having to mention politics."</p><p>O'Keefe, who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aspergers-twitter-comedy-club" target="_blank">has been known</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-lowlife" target="_blank">confront subjects of videos</a> once they're released, confronted Boland at a restaurant to allow him an opportunity to defend his comments. Boland declined. Police were called. An officer of the law informed O'Keefe, "If you’re trespassing, you’re going to get locked up, and I’m pretty sure you’re going to be on the news, as well."</p><p>As reported here on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website on Wednesday, it was unclear if the response to Project Veritas' expose would be: "I was taken out of context" or "We've placed him on paid leave pending a full investigation." <a href="https://connecticut.news12.com/video-shows-greenwich-assistant-elementary-school-principal-allegedly-discussing-progressive-hiring-agenda" target="_blank">Boland was </a><a href="https://connecticut.news12.com/video-shows-greenwich-assistant-elementary-school-principal-allegedly-discussing-progressive-hiring-agenda">placed on leave pending a full investigation</a>.

## Progressive city crime is so bad, a cafe owner is forced to teach employees kung fu for their own protection

Decades of progressive voters electing progressive leaders to enact progressive policies have turned these cities into giant suckholes. Top of that list? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-homeless-guy" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>. Where crime has gotten so bad, a cafe owner is teaching employees kung fu to protect themselves from criminals.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="5b695" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31404954&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>In a lot of these cities, crime has gotten worse over the past two years due to Democrat-endorsed defunding of the police, where the rights of criminals are favored over the rights of non-criminals in the name of "equity." <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-slums-developing-countries" target="_blank">But experts have been comparing San Francisco to a world-class slum ever since 2018</a>. At the Chinatown-located Jade Chocolates Teahouse and Café, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/chocolate-shop-san-francisco-chinatown-185814139.html" target="_blank">owner Mindy Fong</a> closes shop early on Mondays to teach her employees kung fu due to the increase in robberies. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicken-self-defense" target="_blank">As one martial arts expert tells us</a>, "If a man comes to attack you and you know Kung fu, you're going 'hi-ya' him, right?"</p><p>Fong was also worried about the anti-Asian hate in the area during SCHMOVID-19. For a time, hashtag StopAsianHate was a thing when liberals and the media (but I repeat myself) thought the hate was committed by Trump supporters upset over what was called the "China virus." Once liberals and the media (but again, repeating myself) realized most perpetrators weren't MAGA-loving Caucasians, they lost interest in the Asian hate.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="f767f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31404994&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Critics wonder why the shop isn't teaching employees something useful like jiujitsu. Scott McTaggert, executive chef of Jade Chocolates, has been practicing something called "wing tsun." It's a version of kung fu that focuses on self-defense. <em>“I will do everything I can do to make our employees feel safer and more empowered, so they can live their lives without being afraid."</em> </p><p>Everything except vote for leaders who will actually do something to make the city safe that is.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="34c2b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31405005&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Welcome to San Francisco. Some store owners combat crime <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-businesses-taxes" target="_blank">by threatening not to pay taxes</a> (even though you know they're going to cave). Other store owners <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-camera-store-robbery" target="_blank">keep a bat handy to handle business</a>. And a chocolate shop teaches kung fu.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/" target="_blank">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">
