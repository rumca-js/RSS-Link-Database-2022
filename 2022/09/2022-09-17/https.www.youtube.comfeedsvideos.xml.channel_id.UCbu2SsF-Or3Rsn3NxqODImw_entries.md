From Fortnite to Candy Crush, concerns have long been raised about the addictive potential of video games. But when the World Health Organization classified 'Gaming disorder' as an addictive behaviour in 2018, the psychology community found itself divided.

Some believed the WHO's decision was based on poorly-constructed research, while others have reported success in treating the condition. So was the WHO right to make this decision, and does Gaming Addiction really exist?

ReTamoor and Jean-Luc got hands on with the upcoming Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village, which remixes familiar locations and brings in the 3rd person perspective of RE2 Remake.

Resident Evil Village Shadows of Rose is the upcoming story DLC as a part of the Winter Expansions for Resident Evil Village: Gold Edition. Taking place after the main campaign, the DLC will act as an epilogue of sorts as players take control of Rose Winters, who seeks to be rid of her powers.

Unlike the main game, Shadow of Rose is exclusively in the 3rd person perspective, putting it more in line with the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The section of the game we got to play takes place in Castle Dimitrescu. The castle is now covered in a goopy red substance and filled a new type of enemy called the face eaters. Rose can use her unique powers to remove the red goop as well as attack the face easters,

Resident Evil Village Shadows of Rose launches on October 28th for all platforms.
