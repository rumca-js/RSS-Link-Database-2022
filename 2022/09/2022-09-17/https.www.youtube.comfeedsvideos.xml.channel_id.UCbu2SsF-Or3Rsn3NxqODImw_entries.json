Taking place after the main campaign, the DLC will act as an epilogue of sorts as players take control of Rose Winters, who seeks to be rid of her powers.\n\nUnlike the main game, Shadow of Rose is exclusively in the 3rd person perspective, putting it more in line with the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The section of the game we got to play takes place in Castle Dimitrescu. The castle is now covered in a goopy red substance and filled a new type of enemy called the face eaters. Rose can use her unique powers to remove the red goop as well as attack the face easters,\n\nResident Evil Village Shadows of Rose launches on October 28th for all platforms.\n\n#residentevilvillage #shadowsofrose #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxzBs_MT9bA", "date_published": "2022-09-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
