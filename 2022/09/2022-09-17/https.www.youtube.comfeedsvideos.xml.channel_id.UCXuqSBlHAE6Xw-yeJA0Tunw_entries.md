Thanks to ASUS for sponsoring today's video! Check out ASUS ROG OLED Gaming Monitors here: https://bit.ly/3QQ5omI

Buy an Asus PG42UQ 41.5" Monitor: https://geni.us/6iSnql
Buy an Asus PG48UQ 48" Monitor: https://geni.us/cxq4w

The 42" C2 that Linus JUST installed is great, but it's not a monitor. ASUS has released their PG42UQ based on the same panel, but now with less annoying ABL and proper wake-up functionality. Despite the great display, some things don't quite go according to plan...

A cheap and easy fix is all that separates Linus from revamping his streaming setup with a Sony A7S II. Except it wasn't easy. And actually he didn't save much money in the end either...
