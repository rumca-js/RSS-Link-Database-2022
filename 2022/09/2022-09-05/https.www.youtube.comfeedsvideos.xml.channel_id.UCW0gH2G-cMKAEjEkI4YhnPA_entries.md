Check out the Spear of Éomer!: https://bit.ly/3oppWH2

Today, we're unboxing the Spear of Éomer by United Cutlery UC3508.  The 84” long spear is crafted of wood and reinforced polyresin cold cast steel, with precisely-molded details and coloring. It is presented with a polyresin wall display, sculpted in the horse iconography of Rohan, and includes a certificate of authenticity. The spear comes in two sections that are easy to assemble.

Product Description: Éomer was a captain of the king’s cavalry, Marshal of the Mark, and one of Rohan’s mightiest warriors. He bravely fought alongside King Theoden against the forces of Mordor at the battle of Helm’s Deep and on the Pelennor Fields to protect the white city of Minas Tirith and the hope of all Middle-earth. When the Haradrim army attacked from atop their great beasts of war, the Mûmakil, Éomer led a charge against them. He took two of the beasts down with one throw of his mighty spear.

While this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)
