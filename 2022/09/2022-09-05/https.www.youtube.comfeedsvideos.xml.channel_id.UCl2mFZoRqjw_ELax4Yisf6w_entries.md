Timestamps/Questions:

0:12 Introducing Ian Clarke and Freenet

5:10 As the creator of an uncensorable, anonymous network, can you expound on your thoughts of internet censorship?

8:57 Can you talk about the fact that you can't guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law?

12:35 Can you briefly describe what the original Freenet was and your inspiration for creating Freenet?

15:13 What is Locutus doing differently than Freenet?

16:50 What makes Locutus capable of that type of real-time communication in a way that Freenet doesn't, while remaining decentralized?

20:29 How do you deal with the potential masses of spam?

24:51 Can you talk about the reputation system in Locutus and how it functions?

28:29 If you have a network that is uncensorable, decentralized, anonymous, and open-source, how do you prevent the detestable content from getting out? How do you protect yourself?

30:33 The morals and ethics of having an uncensorable, decentralized, anonymous, and open-source network.

34:05 If content is decentralized in nature, how does this affect longevity?

36:58 What are the security risks, if any, to the user running Freenet?

38:15 How easy would it be for someone to build an app that works on top of the software?

41:04 Can you explain how Locutus is different from Ethereum smart contracts?

42:34 If anonymity isn't a focus, what would be the use in China and Saudi Arabia, since governments can still find out who did what?

43:24 What prevents a troll from hijacking the Freenet network?

44:39 What are your thoughts on the GCHQ?

45:27 How simple is it to use? 

46:43 Can Locutus run detached from the rest of the internet on a mesh network?

49:48 Is this similar to the Invisible Internet Project?

50:56 Why would governments not just ban it and jail the creator?

53:34 How far along is this, if someone wanted to get this to beta testing?

54:16 If other people would like to give a grant for you to continue moving forward with this development, where can we find it?

55:11 Application process in the description for anyone else who is interested in this grant!
