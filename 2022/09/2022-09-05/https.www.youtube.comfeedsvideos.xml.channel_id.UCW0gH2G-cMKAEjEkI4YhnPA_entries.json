The 84\u201d long spear is crafted of wood and reinforced polyresin cold cast steel, with precisely-molded details and coloring. It is presented with a polyresin wall display, sculpted in the horse iconography of Rohan, and includes a certificate of authenticity. The spear comes in two sections that are easy to assemble.\n\nProduct Description: \u00c9omer was a captain of the king\u2019s cavalry, Marshal of the Mark, and one of Rohan\u2019s mightiest warriors. He bravely fought alongside King Theoden against the forces of Mordor at the battle of Helm\u2019s Deep and on the Pelennor Fields to protect the white city of Minas Tirith and the hope of all Middle-earth. When the Haradrim army attacked from atop their great beasts of war, the M\u00fbmakil, \u00c9omer led a charge against them. He took two of the beasts down with one throw of his mighty spear.\n\nWhile this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#lordoftherings #eomer #unboxing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk9N5egdwp8", "date_published": "2022-09-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
