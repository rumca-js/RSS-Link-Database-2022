Running a tech YouTube channel is no easy task, especially when you have to cover things like AMD CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, Computer Cases, Hard Drives, oh yeah, and making custom merch, like screwdrivers and backpacks and running a streaming website, oh yeah, and then I need people to clean the building because I don't have time... and who will help me move? Or build my house? Or find sponsors for me to tell you about? Oh, man... this is getting out of hand.
