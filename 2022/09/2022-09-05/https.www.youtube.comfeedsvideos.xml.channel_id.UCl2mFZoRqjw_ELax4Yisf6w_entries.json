How do you protect yourself?\n\n30:33 The morals and ethics of having an uncensorable, decentralized, anonymous, and open-source network.\n\n34:05 If content is decentralized in nature, how does this affect longevity?\n\n36:58 What are the security risks, if any, to the user running Freenet?\n\n38:15 How easy would it be for someone to build an app that works on top of the software?\n\n41:04 Can you explain how Locutus is different from Ethereum smart contracts?\n\n42:34 If anonymity isn't a focus, what would be the use in China and Saudi Arabia, since governments can still find out who did what?\n\n43:24 What prevents a troll from hijacking the Freenet network?\n\n44:39 What are your thoughts on the GCHQ?\n\n45:27 How simple is it to use? \n\n46:43 Can Locutus run detached from the rest of the internet on a mesh network?\n\n49:48 Is this similar to the Invisible Internet Project?\n\n50:56 Why would governments not just ban it and jail the creator?\n\n53:34 How far along is this, if someone wanted to get this to beta testing?\n\n54:16 If other people would like to give a grant for you to continue moving forward with this development, where can we find it?\n\n55:11 Application process in the description for anyone else who is interested in this grant!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoV9amsnaQg", "date_published": "2022-09-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
