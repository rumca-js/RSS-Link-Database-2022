I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of a city in the 1930s at night,
probably chiacgo or los angeles, the street sign says Halstead. Lakeview, north of Chicago, it could also be Hollywood/McCadden looking southeast , we can see what is happening in the street, the people walking, the stores open and especially the luxury car

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
