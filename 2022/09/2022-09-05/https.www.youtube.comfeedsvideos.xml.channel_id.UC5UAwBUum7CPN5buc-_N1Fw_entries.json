It also has Vega 8 graphics.\n\nIt comes with 8GB of RAM, and 250GB of SSD, but you can push that up to 64GB of RAM, and 4TB of storage.\n\nYou also get a 14 inch 1080p display, as well as wifi 6 and bluetooth 5, and a 47wh battery.\n\nIn terms of I/O, on the left, you get the kensington lock to secure the laptop to your desk, a gigabit ethernet port, a USB A 3.1 port, a USB 2 port, and an audio jack.\n\nOn the right, you have a barrel charger, an HDMI 2.0 port, another USB A 3.1 port, and a USB C port that supports display out and charging.\n\nThe RYzen 7 5700U has a base clock of 1.8Ghz, and goes up to 4.3 while boosting. On Geekbench 5, it gets 1264 in single core, and 6293 in multi core\n\nIn Shadow of the tomb raider, I got between 25 and 35 FPS at 1080p resolution on low details. At 720P, on low settings, you get a very comfortable 35 to 40 FPS.\n\nBut the main advantage of that lower powered CPU is the battery life. This new model lasted for 7 and a half hours of youtube video playback over wifi at 50% brightness, and with a more realistic workload, I could squeeze 9 hours of battery life.\n\nIn terms of temperatures, at idle, it's around 48 degrees Celsius, and under load, I never saw it going higher than 63 degrees.\n\nThe webcam is still the same 720p potato cam. The microphone is not great either, pretty tinny and muffled, and picks up on key presses and touchpad clicks.\n\nAs per the speakers, they're decent, not saturating, they get pretty loud, they don't sound tinny, and they have some amount of bass.\n\nThe display, on the other hand, is good. It's 1080p, 60hz, 16:9, it covers 100% of sRGB, it's 350 nits, with an anti glare coating, and it's good.\n\nThis keyboard has wide, large keys, which I like, a Plasma logo super key, and typing on it just feels good. The keys are stable, and they'll register a key press even on their very sides, and the sound is nice and clicky.\n\nAs per the touchpad, it's nice to use, smooth, big enough, and responsive. It works for gestures without any issues, it has good palm rejection, and it's precise.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaJR7u_Bdc", "date_published": "2022-09-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
