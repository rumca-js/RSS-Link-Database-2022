In this video we break down how the catalyst puzzles work, as well as the locations of where many of the needed relics will appear. \n#gaming #gamename #gamespot #touchofmalice #kingsfall #oryx #thetakenking #destiny2 #destiny #thewitchqueen #bungie #bungo #ironbanana #courtoforyx #raid #catalyst #exoticquest \n\nSo you just beat King\u2019s Fall and you\u2019re one of the lucky few to see a beautiful shiny exotic drop from the last chest. It\u2019s Touch of Malice! And it kicks major ass, now to unlock the full potential of the excellent exotic scout rifle all you need is the catalyst. Easy right? In this video we\u2019re gonna break down how to get the catalyst, and what it does. I\u2019ll explain verbally how it all works and what you need to know and then will play out the gameplay at the end of each section. Timestamps will be in the video in case you\u2019re lookin for something particular.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome things you guys need to keep in mind is that if you are unable to dunk all the relics in time, the relics may spawn in different spots than shown in the video. However in our tests, all the relics still spawned within the same general area. For example in the Golgoroth section, I show relics at Plates One through Four. But if your team is unable to get the relics dunked in time, you may find that one of the relics spawned at Plate Five instead. Just something to keep in mind.\u00a0\n\nOnce everyone dunks, a hilarious mini-area opens up that was an easter egg from Destiny 1. You\u2019ll see a bunch of launchpads, just hop into one and grab a floating relic and start slamming them down like you\u2019re at an NBA dunk contest. You\u2019ll have a generous amount of time to dunk as many relics as your team possibly can and eventually the catalyst should appear!\n\nTimestamps\n\n0:00 Intro \n0:29 How The Encounters Work \n1:26 First Puzzle Encounter \n3:05 First Encounter Relic Locations  \n4:50 Second Puzzle Encounter \n5:53 Golgoroth Relic Locations \n8:27 Third Puzzle Encounter\n9:34 Third Encounter Relics Being Dunked \n11:15 Getting The Catalyst", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfIM5PaTowE", "date_published": "2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Isonzo\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Isonzo, including the Madsen machine gun, the Rast & Gasser M1898 revolver, and iconic Italian firearm, the Villar Perosa.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:38 - Steyr M1912 \u201cSteyr Hahn\u201d\n02:29 - Lanciabombe \u201cBettica\u201d mortar\n03:36 - Madsen\n04:52 - Fiat Revelli Mod 1914\n07:03 - Mannlicher M95\n09:13 - Rast & Gasser M1898\n10:31 - Beretta Modello 1915\n13:31 - Vetterli-Vitali M1870\n15:41 - Villar Perosa 9mm Mo-15\n17:43 - Mo.91 Carcano Cavalry Carbine\n21:45 - Skoda 7.5cm Gebirgskanone M.1\n23:25 - Ending\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Isonzo and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqwQ767avbM", "date_published": "2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Future Of Assassin's Creed: What Is Project Infinity? | Ubisoft Forward 2022", "description": "Assassin's Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis C\u00f4t\u00e9 talks about Project Infinity, the upcoming hub portal for Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series.
