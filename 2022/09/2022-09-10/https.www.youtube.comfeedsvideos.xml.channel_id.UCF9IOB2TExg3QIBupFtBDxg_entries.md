Cecelia, Social and community outreach worker at a remarkable children's centre in Uplands, Kijabe, (near Nairobi) Kenya.
This is a great organisation I have been involved with for 12 years now. I fully attest to the veracity and dedication of all the staff I have met. The founder is Anne Chege, who my brother and I know well. Anne worked with Barclays Bank for 28 years, looking after orphans and abandoned children within her own home. On retirement she opened this centre and has dedicated her life to the work.
