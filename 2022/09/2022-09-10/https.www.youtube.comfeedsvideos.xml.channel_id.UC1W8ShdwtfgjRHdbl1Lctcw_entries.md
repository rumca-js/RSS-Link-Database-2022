I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of California 1950, Railroad in Southern Pacific in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley areas , You can clearly see what is going on in broad daylight, many businesses open like: Goodwork Cleaners, Kenny's Pipe Fixtures and Plumbing Supplies, and Xibit-Mart and more..

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
