All Nintendo Direct Edition of GameSpot News. Breath of the Wild 2 gets a title, GoldenEye is back, as are the Pikmin, and more.\n\nThe biggest news from today\u2019s Direct was its last reveal; the release date and new name for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The sequel to Breath of the Wild was featured with some brief gameplay, featuring enormous structures floating high in the sky, and Link able to skydive down from them and glide on some sort of wing-like vehicle. We're sure superfans will analyze every frame of the clip for weeks to come.\n\nIt\u2019s me. I am fans.\n\nMuch of the game still remains a mystery, but all will be revealed next year. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches for Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023, more than six years after its predecessor.\n\nThe latest tactical-RPG entry in the series, Fire Emblem Engage is something of a multiverse collision game. Announced during the Nintendo Direct's opening moments, it's set in a world that must face the reemerged Fell Dragon after a millennium of peace. \n\nAs a Divine Dragon, you lead the charge and can summon past Fire Emblem heroes--including legends like Marth--and \"Engage\" with them for powerful attacks. Fire Emblem Engage launches on January 20, 2023, and a Divine Edition featuring an artbook will also be available.\n\nSquare Enix kicked off its current HD-2D frenzy with Octopath Traveler on Switch back in 2018, and it's following up with a sequel next year. Octopath Traveler 2 features eight new characters, this time with intertwining stories across the land of Solistia. \n\nPath actions for the characters will differ depending on if it's day or night, and the world looks like it's a touch more modernized with the additions of trains and other technology. You'll be able to play as a Dancer, Warrior, Merchant, Scholar, Thief, Cleric, Hunter, and Apothecary, which just so happen to be the exact same classes as in the first game. Octopath Traveler 2 is out on February 23, 2023 for Nintendo Switch.\n\nDon't have enough Nintendo 64 games on the Switch? Fear not, as a whole bunch are coming this year and in 2023. Nintendo revealed that Mario Party, Mario Party 2, Mario Party 3, Pilotwings 64, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64 are all coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass members. \n\nThe first two Mario Party games and Pilotwings will arrive in 2022, with the rest of the mentioned games coming next year. Additionally, GoldenEye will be coming with added online play, although it doesn't yet have a release date.\n\nRight after this announcement, Rare shared that a 4K remastered version of the game, with local multiplayer and a smoother framerate would be coming to Xbox Game Pass in the future as well. While this sounds like the better version to play, keep in mind, online multiplayer will be exclusive to the Switch Online edition.\n\nTIMECODES: \n00:12 - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\n00:54 - Fire Emblem Engage\n01:28 - Octopath Traveler 2\n02:15 - GoldenEye and more N64 games come to Switch Online\n03:08 - Pikmin 4\n03:34 - Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cj-SMj6HBU", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Official Launch Date Trailer", "description": "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Remastered is coming to the Nintendo Switch on December 13, take a look at the adventure in this new trailer.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8gBwgfJIBM", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fae Farm Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Direct September 2022", "description": "Restore Azoria to its splendour in Fae Farm, a new Nintendo Switch exclusive, launching Spring 2023.\n\n#nintendo #nintendodirect #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwmEDipMkU8", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fire Emblem Engage Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Direct September 2022", "description": "The latest installment of Fire Emblem, Fire Emblem Engage has been revealed at Nintendo's September Direct.

To celebrate the announcement of Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, which looks to return to the design of the first Assassin's Creed; as well as a plethora of new entries including Assassin's Creed Jade, Assassin's Creed Red, and Assassin's Creed Hexe. \n\nHere are 10 things you didn\u2019t know about the original Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\n#gaming #assassinscreed #gamespot #ubisoft \n\nStu here to break down the secrets and real life histories behind the first Assassin's Creed. Assassin\u2019s Creed defined what the open world genre would look like for Ubisoft during the last 3 console generations. The series itself has gone through award winning highs, lows that have made it a divisive series throughout the gaming industry, and a reinvention that flipped the formula in a fascinating way. It\u2019s been enthralling to go back to 2007 and see where the series has come from, along with the thought and principle that went into its world and story. With the new entry in the series, Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, newly announced; an emphasis on a \u201cback to basics\u201d mentality from Ubisoft will be interesting to see how they execute it within the framework of how different Assassin\u2019s Creed looks and feels today from its inception.\n\nFor More Assassin's Creed, check out Jordan Ram\u00e9e's chat with Assassin's Creed Mirage art director, Jean-Luc Sala.\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-sounds-like-a-fantastic-return-to-the-roots-of-the-series/1100-6507322/\n\nSTAMPS:\n00:00 Intro\n00:23 Half Horse, Half Man, Half Terrifying\n00:57 Assassins Roll Out!\n01:11 The Sacred Texts!\n01:38 Assassins Couch Co-Op\n02:16 Side Missions, Schmide Missions\n03:20 The Animus\n04:00 Multilingual\n04:34 Historical Fiction\n05:47 On Eagle's Wings\n06:32 Prince of Persia: Assassin\n07:46 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSpEi36vF_I", "date_published": "2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Forspoken Hands-On Preview: Spider-Man's Movement And Combat With Magic", "description": "Forspoken has fun traversal and combat, but it isn't reinventing the open-world wheel.\n#gaming #Forspoken #gamespot #SquareEnix #JRPG \n\nIf you imagine Spider-Man, Marvel's super-agile superhero, slinging a variety of deadly magic spells rather than webs, you have a good idea of what it's like to play Forspoken. Square Enix's upcoming open-world action game puts equal emphasis on quick movement and bombarding your opponents with all manner of magic in an experience that's all about fast thinking, smart movement, and overwhelming force.\n \nSquare Enix recently gave GameSpot a chance to play about an hour of Forspoken in a curated demo. We didn't play the actual game, but rather, a specifically crafted slice that demonstrated how Forspoken will feel and gave a sense of how its open world will work. In some ways, what we saw of Forspoken felt familiar for anyone who's played a lot of open-world games--there are a lot of locations to unlock, small challenges to complete, and items to collect to upgrade protagonist Frey's powers.\n\nWhere Forspoken stands apart is in its traversal and combat, once you get the hang of both. It's a fast and frenetic game, giving you a whole host of abilities to use against enemies. While you'll have to think about how to best use all the magic weapons at your disposal, the fun of Forspoken is in the speed--it relies less on methodical planning and more on hitting opponents with everything you've got. \n\nThe demo we played took place in a series of vast fields, craggy valleys, and swampy lowlands. Most of the time, you'll get around with Forspoken's magical parkour system, which has been a big highlight in trailers and gameplay videos so far. Holding down a single face button on your controller activates the ability, which causes Frey to bound forward and to automatically climb up or spring off any obstacles that get in her way. You can't parkour forever, though--Frey has a limited amount of stamina that has to be recharged after a while.\n\nTo get the most out of the traversal system, you want to plan your moves through the world to actually hit obstacles and use them to your advantage. For instance, just bounding across an open field will let you move fast for a short period, but you'll get farther if you cut through a stand of trees, because Frey will kick off them as she passes to get extra speed and distance. You'll also want to combine the parkour system with Frey's ability to grab onto ledges or special rocks with a sort of magical rope, which allows her to zip forward or upward like Spidey making his way up a building or across rooftops.\n\nGetting around in Forspoken feels pretty good, and the game keeps things simple so that you don't have to do much more than hold down a button and steer for Frey to navigate terrain. But even the demo we saw had a pretty huge open world, with a lot of space between points of interest. A fast-travel system you unlock by visiting key locations helps make moving around quicker and easier. It seems that while parkouring around the map will be a main focus of the experience, the parkour mechanics are better for shorter trips around objects--at least until you unlock more capabilities as you explore and Frey levels up. I found myself running out of steam as I tried to cross large areas, and it took me a while to get a good sense of how to utilize the system to make getting around fun instead of arduous.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNI6NohOZUE", "date_published": "2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Logitech About To Reveal Its Steam Deck Competitor | GameSpot News", "description": "Logitech is getting into the gaming handheld business, a Nintendo Direct is incoming, confusion over Assassin's Creed Mirage's rating, and download the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 beta early.\n#Gaming #CallOfDuty #AssassinsCreed #SteamDeck #NintendoDirect \n\nLogitech is unveiling a new gaming handheld, a September Nintendo Direct is happening, and confusion over the new Assassin\u2019s Creed. All this and more on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nLogitech is unveiling its own gaming device on September 21. In the wake of Valve\u2019s successful handheld, Steam Deck, the PC peripheral manufacturer is attempting its own portable gaming console, although it will be significantly different compared to what is available on the market already.\n\nThe product, which Logitech is partnering with gaming giant Tencent on, will have a focus on streaming games. The company revealed that it is working with Microsoft and Nvidia to make sure that their services, Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now respectively, work smoothly on the device.\n\nIt seems, however, that the device won\u2019t solely be for streaming games. Images of the device that leaked in August showed a \u2018Google Play\u2019 front and center on the console\u2019s homescreen, which if indicative of the final OS that will ship with the device, suggests that the hardware\u2019s processor will be beefy enough to run native Android games as well.\n\nA tease for the September 21 event suggests that the device will have a yellow button adorned with the Logitech logo, identical to the one in the leaks, possibly confirming the validity of those images. \n\nFrom one handheld to another, a Nintendo Direct is happening tomorrow, September 13, the company not breaking its streak of having a September Direct every year since 2016. It will include \"roughly 40 minutes\" of new information, focusing on games coming to Nintendo Switch this winter. \n\nMultiple games are rumored to be part of the presentation, including two ports of The Legend of Zelda--Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD--as well as a remaster of the original Metroid Prime. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which are scheduled to release on November 18, should feature during the event as well. Other than Metroid Prime 4 and the Breath of the Wild sequel, Nintendo\u2019s first party slate of officially announced games after Scarlet and Violet is completely unknown.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping for Mario Kart 9! Just kidding. They\u2019re going to sell Mario Kart 8 forever. Why do you think it\u2019s logo is infinity?\n\nAnother showcase of games that happened over the weekend was Ubisoft Forward, which included a presentation on Assassin\u2019s Creed celebrating its 15th anniversary. A smaller, AC1 inspired title called Mirage will release early next year, set in Baghdad and featuring a young Basim, a side character in 2020\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. \n\nTwo additional games for console and PC, similar in scope to the recent, larger entries, were also announced; Project Red will allow players to finally climb around feudal Japan as a shinobi, and the spooky Project Hexe which is rumored to be set during the Holy Roman Empire and focus on the witch trials of that period. Red and Hexe will kick of Ubisoft\u2019s hub for Assassin\u2019s Creed, Infinity, which Ubisoft has confirmed will feature multiplayer elements in the future.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8O3_IMkNcw", "date_published": "2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
