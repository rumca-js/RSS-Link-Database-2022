Note: This is a developing story, and it’s moving quickly. Since we recorded this video, Russia has taken massive steps to implement its annexation playbook over the eastern regions of Ukraine. My hope is that this video can provide a foundation for you to understand the major building blocks of this strategy so that you can follow the news in the coming weeks and months to see how this plays out.

Make sure you have a voting plan and help your friends make one, too! Many states have early voting or vote-by-mail options that make it easier than ever.
