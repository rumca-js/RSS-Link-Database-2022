Much like its predecessor, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope prioritizes having a variety of movement options.

Though Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope builds on the core idea of its predecessor, Kingdom Battle, its formula makes some big departures too. Most notably, Sparks of Hope outright transforms the flow of combat, dropping the grid-based movement and strict action economy of Kingdom Battle to incorporate a wider variety of meaningful choices that you can make for each character on their turn. It's a lot to keep track of and experiment with but, man, it all results in an incredibly fun game that I cannot wait to play in full. Every battle felt like an opportunity to switch things up and try something new in order to further refine how to get the most out of my movement and each character's unique skillset--even after the whole three hours I had, I still left the preview event thinking about how I hadn't gotten the chance to try absolutely every combination available. Sparks of Hope is definitely a game to look out for, coming to Switch on October 20.

## The Diofield Chronicle Review

The Diofield Chronicle is a pedestrian real-time tactics game that suffers from a lack of imagination.

Essentially a protracted series of tactical battles, Diofield Chronicle's design falls into an early routine from which it is reluctant to deviate, while its fantasy world apes the war-room politicking of Game of Thrones with a focus on moving the chess pieces at the expense of credible character development. Flashes of progress are seen in its combat, and the occasional voice dares to question a realm ruled by divine authority, but both efforts are ultimately futile, crushed by an exhausting and relentless war machine.

The Diofield Chronicle is a a tactical, strategy JRPG published by Square Enix. Diofield is available on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Microsoft's CEO hits back at PlayStation, PC specs for Modern Warfare 2, and new details on the next Splinter Cell.
#Gaming #ModernWarfare2 #PlayStation #Xbox 

Microsoft’s CEO weighs in on the Xbox/PlayStation drama, Modern Warfare 2 specs for PC dropped, and an update on the next Splinter Cell game. All on today’s GameSpot News.

Speaking with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is confident that the company's proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard will be approved by regulators. 

The executive went on to point out that Microsoft is not the biggest player in gaming--he estimated that Microsoft is the No. 4 or No. 5 player in the space, with Sony being first. "So if this is about competition, let us have competition," Nadella said.

While this statement is true, acquiring Activision would likely make Microsoft the biggest games publisher, and on top of that, Microsoft as a whole is a much bigger company than Sony, with a market capitalization over twenty times the size.

Nadella's comments came after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority launched a more extensive investigation into the buyout. The CMA said it is "concerned" that Microsoft's proposal to buy Activision Blizzard could "substantially lessen competition" for sales of game consoles, subscription services, and cloud gaming networks.

But forget about PlayStation and Xbox. PC gaming is the only way to fly. You’re above petty corporate squabbles. All you care about is Modern Warfare 2 PC specs, which dropped today, along with the open beta for the game on the platform… If you pre-ordered!

The minimum specs for the beta call for 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-3570 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X CPU, along with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon RX 470 card. The recommended specs, meanwhile, call for 16 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7-4770K or AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 580 card.

So if you’ve built or bought a PC in the last 8-ish years, you should be in the clear.

Fine tuning your in-game settings has also never been easier. Modern Warfare 2 has added some great functionality, such as a customizable quick settings menu and a settings search bar.

A full list of specs and features can be found on GameSpot dot com.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II has made big changes to guns, movement, throwables, and perks. Let’s give you the knowledge to slay in the open beta. 

Timestamps: 
0:26 Movement Changes
2:13 Perk Packages 
4:12 Gadgets & Nades
8:32 Guns and Progression
10:46 Quality of Life Changes
12:10 3rd Person Mode

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II brings a lot of new changes to Call of Duty, and you can see them in the open beta. In this video, we’re going to dive into what’s new with movement, perks, gadgets and grenades, gun customization, third-person mode, and quality of life. 

Overall, Infinity Ward has delivered fantastic map design with multiple lanes and climbing routes. To get through those spaces quickly, it’s time for you to learn what you can and can’t dolphin dive over and how wall-hanging and peeking works. Spoilers, you can even shoot over the top of walls while hanging. 

Perks have had an overhaul and now come in packages, which means players don’t have to choose between specialists and killstreaks the way they did in Modern Warfare 2019. We have a few recommended builds for you in order to self-revive and quickly regenerate lethal and tactical items. 

In the gadgets and grenades territory, it’s time for you to learn how to use drill charges, which can go through floors, ceilings, and walls. We’ll have a look at shock sticks and their uses to build space and prevent enemies from pushing you. We’ll also have a look at seemingly Rainbow Six Siege-inspired gadgets like cameras and mobile barricades. Then we’ll mess around with the hilarious and maybe not very useful decoy dummy, which still has a few surprises you might not know about. 

Guns and progression have been revamped for better or worse and the Gunsmith menu now sees players unlocking categories of attachments and guns with the ability to swap out receivers and make Franken-guns. Although this system allows for more variety and less time spent unlocking attachments for every gun, it also comes with confusing menus, so we’ll explain how it works. For example, you might need to grind kills with a battle rifle to get a submachine gun. We can also show you how to cheese standard loadout classes to unlock the Lachmann-556 until that gets patched. 

Finally, we’ll have a look at new quality-of-life changes, like an FOV slider on base consoles, as well as varied and fantastic attention to detail on character animations. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta runs September 22-23 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC for players who pre-order the game,  and then for everyone September 24-26. The open beta period should finally include Battle Maps with modes such as Ground War. Modern Warfare 2 releases on October 28, with Warzone 2.0 releasing on November 16.

Logitech unveils a cloud based gaming handheld, Xbox gets a fun update, PlayStation won't launch their own games day and date on their PS Plus, and the details on the next Modern Warfare 2 beta.
#Gaming #SteamDeck #Logitech #PS5 #ModernWarfare2 

Logitech has jumped into the gaming handheld market that’s currently dominated by Steam Deck, Xbox has put out a new update, and PlayStation Studios games aren’t coming to subscriptions day and date any time soon. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

Logitech has a gaming handheld, that can play games like Halo Infinite, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. But there’s a catch— it’s all done via streaming.

Via services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now, this device will allow you to take your games on the go… As long as you have a WiFi connection, because there’s zero options for cellular.

If you’re asking yourself, “is there anything this can do that my phone with a controller grip can’t?” the answer is no, there seemingly isn’t. And if you own a handheld like the Steam Deck that can play dedicated PC games, those also allow you to access the same streaming services, although the process to set them up is a little more complicated on those devices.

There is one area that the Logitech G Cloud gaming handheld succeeds in and that is battery life. If you don’t want to drain your phone’s power, Logitech’s handheld will provide up to 12 hours of battery life. It also sports a 7-inch, 1080p LCD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate. You’d think with a price tag of $350, matching the OLED Switch, it would pack an OLED screen. 

If this incredibly niche product speaks to you, then pre-ordering ahead of its October 15th launch will nab you a $50 discount.

On the console side, Xbox has put out a fun update for its users. With this latest update you'll be able to change the Xbox button color on any Series 2 Elite controller. You can do so in the Xbox Accessories app on your Xbox console or PC, as long as your controller is connected. Alongside this, Xbox has released its Elite Series 2 Core controller, a white version of the device that excludes additional items such as the backpedals and swappable thumbsticks for a lower price point fo $130. Those items can be purchased in an additional accessory pack for $60.

## Scorn Preview - Beautiful, Disturbing, And A Bit Directionless

We got a chance to see Scorn during a preview, and it looks to be shaping up to be an impressively haunting game. That said, we hope the full release offers more context to the world and the player's goal.
#gaming #scorn #gamespot 

Scorn's entire intent seems to be to disgust, disturb, and unnerve the player with its terrifying imagery of fleshy hallways and unsettling biomechanical monstrosities. Developer Ebb Software says that it pulled from the works of Swiss artist H. R. Giger and Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor Zdzisław Beksiński when constructing its part flesh, part machine world--injecting Giger's biomechanical art style into Beksiński's dystopian surrealism.

Scorn is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC on October 21. The game will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.

## The Texas Chain Saw Hands-On Preview

After working on Friday The 13th, Gun Interactive says it understood Texas Chain Saw couldn't just be a "copy and paste."
#gaming #gamename #gamespot 

The number of asymmetrical horror games has risen dramatically over the last few years, with games such as Friday The 13th, Dead By Daylight, Evil Dead, and more giving players the chance to see the world through the eyes of both original monsters and licensed slashers--not to mention their hapless victims. No two of these games are the same, but Gun Interactive is one of a very small number of studios to work on a second, separate franchise within the genre. For the studio, moving from the misty Camp Crystal Lake to the oppressive Texas heat is an undertaking that goes beyond setting and scenery.

The game plays in 4v3 matches where four victims--notably not named "survivors," but instead "victims"--awaken already ensnared by the Slaughter family that consists of the hitchhiker, the cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. In the 50 years since the original Tobe Hooper movie shocked audiences with its unflinching portrayals of violence, Leatherface has outgrown his own series in a way, partly due to marketing decisions, Keltner believes. As slashers blew up in the 1980s, Leatherface had to become the series' mascot, its face of evil who could stand tall next to Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and the rest. But the original movie was much more focused on the family as a whole, so, in being a recreation of sorts of that 1974 film, the game does this too.

Faithful video game adaptations of other visual media can uniquely immerse players who bring with them a level of familiarity, and for me today, that means an eagerness to get back into that house despite knowing the horrors that await within it.
