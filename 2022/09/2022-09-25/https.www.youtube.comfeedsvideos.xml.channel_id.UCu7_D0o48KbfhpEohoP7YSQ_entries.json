Most of us use PIR sensors for that purpose. Unfortunately, they do not detect presence without movement and switch off. Who wants that the TV switches off when you quietly watch a video?\nRecently, new radar sensors appeared that solve this problem. But they have a slow reaction when you enter the room. Some YouTubers suggest combining such a sensor with a PIR. An expensive workaround. \n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nLD2410 Sensor: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnFejPD\nLD2410 including base: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dn2nWZv\nAqara FP1 Sensor: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFWJrMF\nTuya sensor??: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DcHLk0n\nLD2410 Info: https://www.iclegend.com/en/product/list/S3KM111L/#doctor \nSensor info: https://h.hlktech.com/Mobile/download/fdetail/198.html\nFCCio Database: https://fccid.io/2AWE7\nHome Assistant Radar project: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mmwave-wars-one-sensor-module-to-rule-them-all/453260\nTuya Sensor blog post: https://blakadder.com/cheapest-tuya-human-presence-sensor/\nOther 24GHz Sensor:\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (no additional cost for you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGithub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
