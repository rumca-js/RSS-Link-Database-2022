Her most recent album, Special, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Concurrently with her music, Lizzo\u2019s streaming TV series, Watch Out For The Big Grrrls, won an Emmy Award. Now, Lizzo is getting ready to embark on her Special arena tour. \u201cThe biggest form of flattery and gratitude is buying a ticket to my show and showing up for me,\u201d Lizzo says. \u201cI always say that's more than streams, more than views, more than likes on the internet. When you buy a ticket to my show, it just means the world to me.\u201d\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Lizzo recently took the time to connect with The Current Morning Show\u2019s Jill Riley, where the two got to talk about everything going on in Lizzo\u2019s life \u2014 and vitally, the effect it has on other people.\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013\u00a0Lizzo\nHost \u2013 Jill Riley\nProducer \u2013\u00a0Rachel Frances\nVideo and Audio \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013\u00a0Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
