Detecting humans is one of the biggest challenges in Home Automation. Most of us use PIR sensors for that purpose. Unfortunately, they do not detect presence without movement and switch off. Who wants that the TV switches off when you quietly watch a video?
Recently, new radar sensors appeared that solve this problem. But they have a slow reaction when you enter the room. Some YouTubers suggest combining such a sensor with a PIR. An expensive workaround.
