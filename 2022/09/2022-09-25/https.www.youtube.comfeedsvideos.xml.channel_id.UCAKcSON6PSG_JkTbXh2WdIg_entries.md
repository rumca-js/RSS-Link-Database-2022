Lizzo is a superstar; a busy, hardworking artist whose career trajectory has been amazing and inspiring to behold. Her most recent album, Special, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Concurrently with her music, Lizzo’s streaming TV series, Watch Out For The Big Grrrls, won an Emmy Award. Now, Lizzo is getting ready to embark on her Special arena tour. “The biggest form of flattery and gratitude is buying a ticket to my show and showing up for me,” Lizzo says. “I always say that's more than streams, more than views, more than likes on the internet. When you buy a ticket to my show, it just means the world to me.”

Despite her busy schedule, Lizzo recently took the time to connect with The Current Morning Show’s Jill Riley, where the two got to talk about everything going on in Lizzo’s life — and vitally, the effect it has on other people.
