42%increased chance of developing a neuro problem after covid, equating to 7% of those infected.

Dr. Al-Aly

Overall, COVID-19 has contributed to more than 40 million new cases of neurological disorders worldwide

Comprehensive evaluation of postacute neurologic sequelae at 1 year

National healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs

Covid cohort = 154,068

(nonhospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care)

Contemporary controls = 5,638,795

Historical controls = 5,859,621 (2017 data)

Average age of 61

Estimate risks and burdens of incident neurologic disorders at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection

Longitudinal observational study design

March 2020 through January 2021

(predates delta, omicron and other COVID variants)

Results

In the postacute phase of COVID-19, there was increased risk of an array of incident neurologic sequelae

Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke

TIA

Cognition and memory disorders

Peripheral nervous system disorders

Episodic disorders (e.g. migraine, seizures)

Extrapyramidal and movement disorders

Mental health disorders, (anxiety depression psychosis)

Musculoskeletal disorders

Sensory disorders

Guillain–Barré syndrome

Encephalitis or encephalopathy

Headaches

Hazard ratio of any neurologic sequela

1.42 (1.38 to 1.47)

Burden

70.69 (63.54 to 78.01) per 1,000 persons at 12 months

Or, 7.069%

The risks and burdens were elevated even in people who did not require hospitalization during acute COVID-19

Risks and burdens increased according to the severity of the acute infection,

from nonhospitalized to hospitalized to intensive care

Dizzynes

Taken together, our results provide evidence of increased risk of long-term neurologic disorders in people who had COVID-19.

Composite of these extrapyramidal and movement disorders were HR 1.42, burden 3.98


Mental health disorders

Major depressive disorders, stress and adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders

Composite of these mental health disorders were HR 1.43, burden 25.00

Musculoskeletal disorders

Joint pain, myalgia, myopathy

Composite of these musculoskeletal disorders were HR 1.45, burden 40.09

Sensory disorders

Hearing abnormalities, tinnitus, vision abnormalities, loss of smell, loss of taste

Composite of these sensory disorders were HR 1.25, burden 17.03 

Other neurologic or related disorders

Dizziness, somnolence, Guillain–Barré syndrome, encephalitis or encephalopathy, transverse myelitis

Composite of these other neurologic or related disorders were HR 1.46, burden 7.37

Composite outcome of any neurologic disorder

Compared with the contemporary control group, there was increased risk and burden of any neurologic outcome

HR 1.42, burden 70.69

69% higher risk of Alzheimer's for older COVID survivors

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/09/possible-69-higher-risk-alzheimers-older-covid-survivors

Older COVID-19 survivors,

69% higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease,

within 1 year of infection

Medical records of 6,245,282 

65 years and older

Medical visits but no previous diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease

February 2020 to May 2021

410,748 participants tested positive for COVID-19

5,834,534 did not test positive

COVID-19 survivors had a 69% higher risk of a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease within 1 year of infection than their uninfected peers

Hazard ratio 1.69; 95% (1.53 to 1.72)

Most at risk

Ages 85 and older, HR = 1.89

Women, HR = 1.82

Association of COVID-19 with New-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease

13th September 2022

Infectious etiology of Alzheimer’s disease, postulated for decades

So, is SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease?

Retrospective cohort study

N = 6,245,282 older adults (age ≥65 years),

People with COVID-19 were at significantly increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease

Within 360 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis 

Propensity-score matching

COVID-19 cohort = 0.68%

non-COVID-19 cohort = 0.35%

(hazard ratio or HR:1.69)

TriNetX Analytics Platform

de-identified electronic health records

Over 95 million patients

Inpatient and outpatient visits

68 health care organizations

28% of the US population

50 states, covering diverse geographic, age, race/ethnic, income, and insurance groups 

Our findings call for research to understand the underlying mechanisms and for continuous surveillance of long-term impacts of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s disease

Not clear whether COVID-19 triggers or accelerates development of Alzheimer's disease

SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with inflammation and central nervous system disorders

Prior infections, especially viral infections, and inflammation

Dr. Pamela Davis

We thought we had turned some of the tide on it by reducing general risk factors such as hypertension, heart disease, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle

Now, so many people in the U.S. have had COVID and the long-term consequences of COVID are still emerging.

It is important to continue to monitor the impact of this disease on future disability

Plan to continue studying the potential effects of COVID-19 on Alzheimer's,

and other neurodegenerative diseases,

whether certain populations may be especially vulnerable

Assess, any drugs could be repurposed to treat COVID-19's long-term effects
