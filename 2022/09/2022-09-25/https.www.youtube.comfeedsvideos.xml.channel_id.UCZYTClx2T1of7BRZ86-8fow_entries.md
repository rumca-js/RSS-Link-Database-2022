This video was made in partnership with BBC Earth. #OurGreenPlanet is an initiative from BBC Earth, devised to raise awareness for the beauty and fragility of our planet’s green ecosystems, to help people forge a deeper understanding of the important role that plants play in biodiversity, and to be inspired by the extraordinary stories of people around the globe dedicating their lives for positive change.

Humans have done a lot to change the course rivers, but it wouldn't take too much to change these rivers back into health ecosystems.
