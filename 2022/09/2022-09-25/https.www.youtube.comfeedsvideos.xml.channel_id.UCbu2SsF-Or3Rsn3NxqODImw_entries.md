Cyberpunk 2077's initial launch period was highlighted by game-breaking bugs and massive performance issues across last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles at the time. In an unprecedented move, Microsoft and Sony began issuing refunds, with Cyberpunk 2077 being removed from the PlayStation storefront for a lengthy period of time.

Fast-forward to 2022, and Cyberpunk 2077's road to recovery has seen developer CD Projekt release massive patches that have helped it find new life on console and PC. The recent Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime series on Netflix has also helped shift new fans to the game, and on Steam the game has climbed the charts and remains in the top 10 most-played games on Steam currently.

The God of War franchise has a sprawling timeline that interweaves its Great Greek Tragedy across 9 games, and 2 wildly distinct mythologies. But how does it all tie together?

This video breaks down the franchise chronologically, charting the story of Kratos from a hot headed youth, through to a captain in the Spartan army all before his grand odyssey through the Greek and Norse mythologies.

With God of War Ragnarök set to further slide the franchise’s anti-hero, Kratos, into a mythological mire, what better time to dive back into the Ghost of Sparta’s saga of gods and monsters.

From FIFA to Star Wars, the mass adoption of loot boxes is one of the most controversial things to happen to mainstream gaming in the last 15 years. But despite consistent fears of their mechanical similarities to gambling, and their potential to cause harm to vulnerable players, they remain a profitable means of monetisation for hundreds of games.

So are loot boxes gambling, and do they carry the same potential for harm as gambling does? We spoke to Professor Pete Etchells, author of Lost in a Good Game and Dr Alexander Kriss, author of The Gaming Mind to try and understand the effect loot boxes are having on gamers.
