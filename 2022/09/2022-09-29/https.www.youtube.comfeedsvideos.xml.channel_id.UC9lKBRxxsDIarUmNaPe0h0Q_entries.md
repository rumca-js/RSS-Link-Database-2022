China's economy may be at the point of no return, and it's got everything to do with the three "Ds". Two of these I've spoken about before in some detail, but the third almost nobody knows about.

You've probably seen a lot of videos floating around lately about China, and how it's on the verge of economic collapse, or that a crash is imminent. Sure, some of these claims may be a little far-fetched, but as a whole China's economy isn't anywhere near as strong as you might think.

The first part of this has everything to do with debt, much of which is a result of the global health crisis of the last few years. The second is the nation's strict lockdowns that are still continuing. But the last part is a massive drought, which threatens China's economy even worse.

I'd love to hear your thoughts below, or some of the price increases China's problem is causing to us.
