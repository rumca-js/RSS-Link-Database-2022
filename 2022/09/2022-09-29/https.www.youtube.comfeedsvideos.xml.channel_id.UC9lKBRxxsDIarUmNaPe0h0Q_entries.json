Two of these I've spoken about before in some detail, but the third almost nobody knows about.\n\nYou've probably seen a lot of videos floating around lately about China, and how it's on the verge of economic collapse, or that a crash is imminent.

The second is the nation's strict lockdowns that are still continuing. But the last part is a massive drought, which threatens China's economy even worse.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts below, or some of the price increases China's problem is causing to us.\n\n0:00 - China's economy is in serious trouble\n1:07 - The first D: Debt\n2:07 - The second D: Disease\n3:54 - NordVPN\n5:17 - The third D: Drought\n6:13 - How China's economy affects us\n7:20 - Some final thoughts\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
