Deep dive into Rings of Power Episode 6: "Udûn" !  We'll look for all the references to Tolkien's deeper lore, explain what is happening, and I'll give some thoughts along the way.  While this was a more action-oriented episode, there's still a lot of lore-related things to discuss and an explosive ending (which I correctly predicted!)
