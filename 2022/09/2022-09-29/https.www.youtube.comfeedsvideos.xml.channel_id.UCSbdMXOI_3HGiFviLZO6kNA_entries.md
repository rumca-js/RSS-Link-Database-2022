Hello. We have been waiting YEARS for this. 
FINALLY, Bonelab has released on all platforms, Oculus Quest 2 and SteamVR for Index and all other VR headsets. This is my total review of the game and its future potential. There is so much more to this game than "just a typical FPS" 

From the gameplay, story, modding tools and more, this is a SPOILER FREE review of the game and what you can expect. 

I hope you all enjoyed, worked hard on this one. 

You can get my mods for bonelab in my discord server:
