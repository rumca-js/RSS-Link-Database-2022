I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of California 1940s you can clearly see what is going on during the day, The first part is a tour of Newport Beach, a beautiful drive through Los Angeles. On the 101 freeway, we pass through a tunnel, and we see a HUGE chimney. It connects to the next building we see, the Friedman bag factory. Then we go further down into Los Angeles, a few scenes of cars crossing a California intersection, a classic arrow leads you to cities in all directions. Last part We pass through OILWELLS (from the back), then we pass on the side.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
