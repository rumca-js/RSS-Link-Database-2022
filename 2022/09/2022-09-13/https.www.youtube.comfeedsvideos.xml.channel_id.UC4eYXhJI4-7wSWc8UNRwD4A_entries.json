Russell has cultivated this band\u2019s harmoniousness in the year she\u2019s been touring in support of her astounding, unclassifiable album Outside Child, which tells the singer\u2019s life story, from her childhood escaping abuse through an itinerant adolescence and young adulthood anchored, finally, by the love and community she\u2019s found as a feminist and a music-maker. This group \u2014 three string players, two guitarists, a drummer and Russell on her banjo and clarinet \u2014 embodies healing community, and its interplay and gospelized group vocals turbo-charged every song.\n \nRussell, who burned a little palo santo wood and placed portraits of Prince and Joni Mitchell nearby as talismans before performing, began her set by invoking the ancestors with \u201cQuasheba.\u201d She continued with the incantatory \u201c4th Day Prayer,\u201d a spell cast to undo the oppression of childhood trauma. The intense interplay of cellists Larissa Maestro and Monique Ross and violinist Chauntee Ross undergirded the propulsive arrangement. The blues-rooted \u201cNightflyer\u201d followed; drummer Megan Coleman\u2019s green satin angel-wing sleeves shimmered as she marked a beat that guitarists Joy Clark and Mandy Fer intensified. Then came \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone,\u201d a song Russell originally wrote as part of the Americana supergroup Our Native Daughters, just rereleased as a duet with Brandi Carlile. \u201cLa musique nous r\u00e9unit / Une famille,\u201d Russell sang in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French. \u201cA family,\u201d she repeated. That\u2019s what her music makes.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cQuasheba\u201d\n\u201c4th Day Prayer\u201d\n\u201cNightflyer\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAllison Russell: lead vocals, banjo, clarinet\nMonique Ross: cello, vocals\nChauntee Ross: violin, vocals\nLarissa Maestro: cello, vocals\nMandy Fer: electric guitar, vocals\nJoy Clark: acoustic guitar, vocals\nMegan Coleman: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Series Creator: Bob Boilen \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Joshua Bryant\nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistants: Joby Tanseco, Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #AllisonRussell", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffs7szmBmCU", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
