But it still paid off. https://leadfrombehind.org/\n\nLEAD FROM BEHIND is on a mission to make colon cancer famous. \nWe're raising awareness that #ColonCancer is The Preventable Cancer. \n\n\u25ba Colon cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in America. 1 in 24 Americans gets colon cancer. It doesn\u2019t need to be - because it\u2019s preventable.\n\u25ba The best way to prevent colon cancer is by getting a colonoscopy when you turn 45. The guidelines changed in 2021 lowering the age from 50 to 45.\n\u25ba People don\u2019t want to talk about colonoscopies, let alone get one. We\u2019re using humor and heart to change that.\n\u25ba Colon cancer is rising in young people - predicted to be the top cancer killer for people under 50 by 2030.\n\nLEAD FROM BEHIND is founded by Brooks Bell, powered by @colorectalcanceralliance, and created in partnership with Maximum Effort & Chrysi Philalithes.\n\n#LeadFromBehind", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sXkIUZEWIo", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
