All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News. \n\nAlongside a new trailer for God of War: Ragnarok during PlayStations recent State of Play also came the reveal of a branded DualSense controller. Featuring an icy white and blue style inspired by Midgard along with images of a bear (Kratos) and a wolf (Atreus).\n\nThe story trailer itself gives us our best look yet at the plot of the game. We get an extensive narration from Tyr, the Norse God of War, who crosses paths with Kratos and questions his Greek counterpart\u2019s motivations. The trailer shows of an extensive breadth of different locales, as well as a bevy of new enemies, the developer having explained previously to Game Informer that the studio was focused on an increased variety of foes.\n\nThe trailer ends with two incredible moments. We first get Kratos and Atreus standing next to two large wolves staring up at an eclipse.\n\nI do want to point out, without proper eye protection. Remember, these are ancient gods, so don\u2019t try this at home.\n\nSpoilers for God of War 2018, Atreus, who was revealed to be Loki at the end of the game, then shoots an arrow at the Moon, one of the wolves chasing it as it begins to move across the sky, tearing it as it goes. This likely indicates that the two wolves are Sk\u00f6ll and Hati, the sons of the wolf Fenrir, whom himself is the son of Loki.\n\nReally interested to see how they explain that in this game.\n\nIn the Norse myth, Sk\u00f6ll and Hati are fated to chase the Sun and the Moon, to then catch them in Ragnarok, plunging the world into darkness, so what we\u2019re seeing in this trailer is potentially our first glimpse of the game\u2019s take on the titular event.\n\nThe final shot of the trailer is then Kratos squaring off against Thor, as the former tosses the Leviathan Axe and the latter throws the hammer Mjolnir, the two colliding before their masters pull them back with magic toward their hands.\n\nMetal.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:12 - God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n02:04 - PSVR2\n02:48 - Like a Dragon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODWt-ofaa-A", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "ID@Xbox Fall Showcase Livestream", "description": "Tune in for another ID@Xbox showcase, featuring updates and new announcements from indie games coming to Xbox, including Metal: Hellsinger, You Suck at Parking, and Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed.\r\n\r\n#xbox #gaming #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3L8TJDGhGA", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PSVR2's Small Iterations Make For Impressive Changes", "description": "PlayStation VR 2 makes the most of the PS5, and Horizon Call of the Mountain is an excellent showcase of what the new headset will be able to do.\u00a0Learn more about Tamoor Hussain's experience in this latest hands on preview for the PlayStation VR 2 and Horizon Call of the Mountain.\n\n#psvr2 #playstation #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-dFKRiwbxw", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Things You Might Have Missed", "description": "Max Blumenthal combs over the latest trailer from BOTW sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. From where these locations are referencing to how the name connects to the game, we breakdown what we might be looking forward to in the follow up game.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 finally dropped its official name, Tears of the Kingdom will be released May 12th of 2023. We\u2019ll take a quick look at what we saw and put some more insight into things you might have missed during the trailer. \n\nWe open up to multiple scenes with multiple stone carvings. I won\u2019t pretend to know everything about Zelda lore and history, but what I do know is that surface level connections can be made immediately to this creature and its Zonai origins, with these common designs seen over and over again, and another part we\u2019ll see in another scene.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe then see an incoming army with malice of the new long horned Bokoblins and Moblins defeating either Hylians or some other tribe we don't know yet. They obviously look human but this could be anything from Hylians, to Sheikah, to some Zonai tribe we haven\u2019t seen yet. We will likely know in the future. Another thing I\u2019d like to point out is that EVERY trailer so far has had some Ghibli reference thrown in again, this time from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, where tapestries of an age long past were shown with somber piano music. We have shown this proof from Castle in the Sky with the floating land masses with roots growing through them, to how malice interacts with Link\u2019s arm to Princess Mononoke, and more, and it\u2019s cool that they\u2019re keeping up with this motif.\n\n#thelegendofzelda #tearsofthekingdom #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zURG4RWnpjk", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "12 MORE Things You STILL Didn't Know In Zelda Breath Of The Wild", "description": "This time in Breath of the Wild, we discover more musical secrets in the game, such as hidden messages the Divine Beasts are sending, how combat music actually works, and Hyrule Castle's dark secret hidden within the notes.\n\nIn the video above, we cover 12 facts, tips and tricks that aren\u2019t quite as well known, ranging from secrets to glitches, so me that are pretty simple and others that are fairly complex.

All Nintendo Direct Edition of GameSpot News. Breath of the Wild 2 gets a title, GoldenEye is back, as are the Pikmin, and more.\n\nThe biggest news from today\u2019s Direct was its last reveal; the release date and new name for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The sequel to Breath of the Wild was featured with some brief gameplay, featuring enormous structures floating high in the sky, and Link able to skydive down from them and glide on some sort of wing-like vehicle. We're sure superfans will analyze every frame of the clip for weeks to come.\n\nIt\u2019s me. I am fans.\n\nMuch of the game still remains a mystery, but all will be revealed next year. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches for Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023, more than six years after its predecessor.\n\nThe latest tactical-RPG entry in the series, Fire Emblem Engage is something of a multiverse collision game. Announced during the Nintendo Direct's opening moments, it's set in a world that must face the reemerged Fell Dragon after a millennium of peace. \n\nAs a Divine Dragon, you lead the charge and can summon past Fire Emblem heroes--including legends like Marth--and \"Engage\" with them for powerful attacks. Fire Emblem Engage launches on January 20, 2023, and a Divine Edition featuring an artbook will also be available.\n\nSquare Enix kicked off its current HD-2D frenzy with Octopath Traveler on Switch back in 2018, and it's following up with a sequel next year. Octopath Traveler 2 features eight new characters, this time with intertwining stories across the land of Solistia. \n\nPath actions for the characters will differ depending on if it's day or night, and the world looks like it's a touch more modernized with the additions of trains and other technology. You'll be able to play as a Dancer, Warrior, Merchant, Scholar, Thief, Cleric, Hunter, and Apothecary, which just so happen to be the exact same classes as in the first game. Octopath Traveler 2 is out on February 23, 2023 for Nintendo Switch.\n\nDon't have enough Nintendo 64 games on the Switch? Fear not, as a whole bunch are coming this year and in 2023. Nintendo revealed that Mario Party, Mario Party 2, Mario Party 3, Pilotwings 64, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64 are all coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass members. \n\nThe first two Mario Party games and Pilotwings will arrive in 2022, with the rest of the mentioned games coming next year. Additionally, GoldenEye will be coming with added online play, although it doesn't yet have a release date.\n\nRight after this announcement, Rare shared that a 4K remastered version of the game, with local multiplayer and a smoother framerate would be coming to Xbox Game Pass in the future as well. While this sounds like the better version to play, keep in mind, online multiplayer will be exclusive to the Switch Online edition.\n\nTIMECODES: \n00:12 - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\n00:54 - Fire Emblem Engage\n01:28 - Octopath Traveler 2\n02:15 - GoldenEye and more N64 games come to Switch Online\n03:08 - Pikmin 4\n03:34 - Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cj-SMj6HBU", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Official Launch Date Trailer", "description": "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Remastered is coming to the Nintendo Switch on December 13, take a look at the adventure in this new trailer.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8gBwgfJIBM", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fae Farm Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Direct September 2022", "description": "Restore Azoria to its splendour in Fae Farm, a new Nintendo Switch exclusive, launching Spring 2023.\n\n#nintendo #nintendodirect #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwmEDipMkU8", "date_published": "2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fire Emblem Engage Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Direct September 2022", "description": "The latest installment of Fire Emblem, Fire Emblem Engage has been revealed at Nintendo's September Direct.
