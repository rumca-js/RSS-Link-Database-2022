CDC Says 44% of People Hospitalized With COVID Had Third Dose or Booster

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/980351?src=mkm_ret_220912_mscpmrk_trdalrtuk03_int&uac=127834AR&impID=4631827&faf=1

Almost half the people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 last spring had been fully vaccinated and received a third dose or booster shot

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7134a3.htm?s_cid=mm7134a3_x

Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19–Associated Hospitalizations Among Adults During SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 Variant Predominance 

Data from the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network

March 20–May 31, 2022

Among hospitalized nonpregnant patients

39.1% had received a primary vaccination series and 1 booster (3 jabs)

5.0% had received a primary series and ≥2 boosters (4 jabs)

39.1 + 5 = 44.1%

(Medscape is correct, well under by 0.1%)

Therefore, CDC advises

All adults should stay up to date† with COVID-19 vaccination, 

multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures should be used to protect those at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness, 

irrespective of vaccination status

Why?

Unvaccinated adults were 3.4 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID than those who were vaccinated

Also in this CDC report

Hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥65 years,

increased threefold

Hospitalization rates in adults aged 18–49 and 50–64 years,

both increased 1.7-fold during omicron surge

New Zealand drops mask and vaccine mandates in sweeping Covid changes

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/new-zealand-drops-mask-and-vaccine-mandates-in-sweeping-covid-changes

Deaths, 1,950 (about 50 at the end of 2021)

Hospitalisations, (NZ key metric) down sharply in recent weeks

Jacinda Ardern

Today marks a milestone in our response. 

Finally, rather than feeling that Covid dictates what happens to us, 

our lives, and our futures, 

we take back control

Mask-wearing, only compulsory in healthcare settings

(largely ignored anyway)

End of vaccine mandates, for workers and inbound travellers

Tests on arrival in NZ, encouraged

Covid-positives, still required to isolate (no longer household contacts)

This will be the first summer in three years where there won’t be the question of what we will and what won’t be cancelled because of Covid cases
