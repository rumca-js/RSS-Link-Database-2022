Instead of asking the user to do research themselves, why not simply have a single installer with all desktops? 
Couple it with a choice screen at install that lets you see a video of how the desktop environment works: you have a video for Kubuntu, a video for Ubuntu, and each demoes how the desktop works!

A restore partition is basically just an ISO of your base system, that you store on a dedicated partition and that you can boot to using GRUB. It occupies almost no space, you can make it optional at install for people who don't want it, and when something goes wrong, having the ability to immediately reboot on that partition and refresh your system is crucial.


With user accounts, we would be able to restore your downloads when you reinstall. This account or system would probably have to be tied to flathub, or be divided into various repos or distros so that it could remember what you've downloaded from each source: flathub, the ubuntu repos, the AUR, fedora's repos, the snap store, whatever.


Privacy might not be the number one reason to use Linux, but it's still an important one. We could take inspiration from what /e/ has been doing: we could have a system wide tracker blocker for all tracking requests for all apps on our system, whether it's a web browser, or a proprietary app we installed and that makes weird requests to a server.

This privacy center could also serve as a hub for VPNs you might want to use, or it could have its own auto-VPN feature, which just scrambles your geolocation, fake an IP address.


Another thing would be some kind of framework that apps and desktop environments can decide to use, to display release notes, or an inline webview, or a video, or a combination of all 3, after an update.

Have you ever run a program graphically and seen it start and crash, or just not start at all? If so, have you tried running it with the command line? You probably noticed an error displayed there.
I wish we could have these errors appearing graphically as well when a program doesn't start.

Then, I'd like to see application bundles. As in one click installs for a series of applications that users might find useful. 

Another improvement is putting the most downloaded applications FIRST in their categories in app stires.

Another small improvement that I've already talked about in another video is marking official apps as official. The Ubuntu Snap Store already does this, and I think Flathub also should have that, although I think they're working on it.

App stores should also be way more explicit about the package types they offer. If you have a combobox that lets users pick between a deb package, a flatpak, or a snap, you NEED to explain, what these are.

Yet another improvement, would be automated assistants that offer you applications related to what you're doing. Connect a new mouse? Offer a graphical utility to configure it. Connect a new printer? Check if it needs something special to work.
