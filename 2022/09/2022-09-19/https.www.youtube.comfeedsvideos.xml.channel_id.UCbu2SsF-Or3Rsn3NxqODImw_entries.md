A new, slim PlayStation 5 next year, Nvidia's 4000 series GeForce GPUs, Cyberpunk visual updates, and an Iron Man game from EA.
#Gaming #Cyberpunk #PS5 

Has the PlayStation 5 Slim been revealed? Plus, Nvidia’s new (expensive) graphics cards, new Cyberpunk updates for them, and yet another Marvel game announcement. All on today’s GameSpot News.

A new version of the PlayStation 5 will be released in 2023 featuring a detachable disk drive, according to a new report from Tom Henderson at Insider-Gaming. Sources told the site that this new model of the PS5 has been in production since the PS5 launched in November 2020.

The new remodel will reportedly feature a detachable disc drive, and will connect to the PS5 via a USB-C port on the back of the console. The site went on to claim that the PS5 will be sold on its own or in a bundle with the detachable disk drive, while these rumored disc drives will be made available for sale separately.

The new PS5 model is said to be "slimmer and lighter" than the current system. The report had no mention of pricing.

If that wasn’t enough hardware for you, Nvidia finally unveiled their 4000 series cards, and… well they’re not cheap.

The RTX 4090 is Nvidia's new flagship GPU, shipping with 24GB of GDDR6X memory. Nvidia claims that it will be able to deliver framerates higher than 100fps when gaming at 4K, all while consuming the same amount of power as the RTX 3090 Ti. 

Using DLSS 3, the latest version of Nvidia's AI based up-resing tech, Nvidia says that the RTX 4090 sees four times more performance than the RTX 3090 Ti using DLSS 2. The RTX 4090 starts at $1599 and launches on October 12.

The RTX 4080 is launching in two different configurations; a 12GB configuration and a 16GB one. Nvidia claims even the lower-end 12GB card can outperform the 3090 Ti when utilizing DLSS 3. The RTX 4080 16GB starts at $1199, while the 12GB version starts at $899. Both will launch sometime in November.

To show off Nvidia’s fancy new cards and DLSS tech, a new version of Portal is coming out called Portal RTX. It’ll be a free update for owners of the game on Steam in November, and will work on any RTX card, despite DLSS 3 being exclusive to the 4000 series GPUs. 

Nvidia will also be releasing called RTX Remix, that allows modders to easily bring RTX enhancements like up-rezed textures and ray-tracing to older titles, Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind used as an example in the reveal showcase.

If you want to check out these new cards with a more recent release, Cyberpunk is getting a 4000 series makeover. DLSS 3 will allow for a new Overdrive ray-tracing mode, that’ll make the regular, old boring ray-tracing mode on your stupid, crappy current RTX GPU look like you’re playing the game in 1977, not 2077.

## GTA 6 Leak and Gameplay Details, Explained | GameSpot News

How did the Grand Theft Auto 6 leak happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar doing about it? All these questions, answered.
#Gaming #GTA6 #GrandTheftAuto6 #GTA6Leak 

Well, what else is there to talk about? The Grand Theft Auto 6 leak. How did it happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar’s response? Here’s everything you need to know about the biggest leak the gaming industry has ever seen.

Now, before we get into this, I just want to be expressly clear. Everything you are about to see is from previous GTA games. Ok. Rockstar’s legal team, if you’re listening— and I’ve heard they’re big fans of this show— we’re not showing any screenshots. Any gameplay. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Got it? Ok. Good. Here we go.

So how did the leak happen? On Sunday September 20, a user that goes by the name of teapottuberhacker posted on GTAforums.com over 90 clips of in-development footage of the game. They claimed that the clips were taken from Rockstar’s internal Slack, which also allowed them to get their hands on source code for the game.

The hacker updated their post later that day, directing any employees of Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive to contact them via email, as they were "looking to negotiate a deal." There has been no update as of this recording from the hacker.

So what was released? Well, a metric f*ton.

The footage in the 90+ clips totalled a near hour of incomplete GTA 6 gameplay. The validity of the footage before Rockstar could confirm the leak came in the form of two key details that lined up with Bloomberg’s report earlier this year about the game. One, all the gameplay took place in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami parody, and the location of the game according to Bloomberg's report. 

That report also included the detail that the player would take control of two characters, a man and a woman, whom are meant to be a Bonnie and Clyde-like type pairing. The gameplay seen in the leak featured both a playable man and woman. Pop-up text during the footage refers to the man as Jason and the woman as Lucia.

The footage showed off the characters’ abilities to crouch, go prone, and move while doing both. Going prone is something that can’t be done in GTA 5, and the only way to crouch in that game is by taking cover behind a low profile object. 

Both of these elements hint that playing stealthily might be a viable course of action in the game, particularly as the footage also reveals a mechanic to pick up bodies that you could then presumably hide.
