Plus, Nvidia\u2019s new (expensive) graphics cards, new Cyberpunk updates for them, and yet another Marvel game announcement. All on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nA new version of the PlayStation 5 will be released in 2023 featuring a detachable disk drive, according to a new report from Tom Henderson at Insider-Gaming. Sources told the site that this new model of the PS5 has been in production since the PS5 launched in November 2020.\n\nThe new remodel will reportedly feature a detachable disc drive, and will connect to the PS5 via a USB-C port on the back of the console. The site went on to claim that the PS5 will be sold on its own or in a bundle with the detachable disk drive, while these rumored disc drives will be made available for sale separately.\n\nThe new PS5 model is said to be \"slimmer and lighter\" than the current system. The report had no mention of pricing.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough hardware for you, Nvidia finally unveiled their 4000 series cards, and\u2026 well they\u2019re not cheap.\n\nThe RTX 4090 is Nvidia's new flagship GPU, shipping with 24GB of GDDR6X memory. Nvidia claims that it will be able to deliver framerates higher than 100fps when gaming at 4K, all while consuming the same amount of power as the RTX 3090 Ti. \n\nUsing DLSS 3, the latest version of Nvidia's AI based up-resing tech, Nvidia says that the RTX 4090 sees four times more performance than the RTX 3090 Ti using DLSS 2. The RTX 4090 starts at $1599 and launches on October 12.\n\nThe RTX 4080 is launching in two different configurations; a 12GB configuration and a 16GB one. Nvidia claims even the lower-end 12GB card can outperform the 3090 Ti when utilizing DLSS 3. The RTX 4080 16GB starts at $1199, while the 12GB version starts at $899. Both will launch sometime in November.\n\nTo show off Nvidia\u2019s fancy new cards and DLSS tech, a new version of Portal is coming out called Portal RTX. It\u2019ll be a free update for owners of the game on Steam in November, and will work on any RTX card, despite DLSS 3 being exclusive to the 4000 series GPUs. \n\nNvidia will also be releasing called RTX Remix, that allows modders to easily bring RTX enhancements like up-rezed textures and ray-tracing to older titles, Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind used as an example in the reveal showcase.\n\nIf you want to check out these new cards with a more recent release, Cyberpunk is getting a 4000 series makeover. DLSS 3 will allow for a new Overdrive ray-tracing mode, that\u2019ll make the regular, old boring ray-tracing mode on your stupid, crappy current RTX GPU look like you\u2019re playing the game in 1977, not 2077.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aHtO0QD888", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Kiriko Origin Story Trailer", "description": "Get to know more about Kiriko Kamori a ninja healer coming to Overwatch 2!\n\nLearn about how she forged her own path with a mix of tradition and innovation.\n\n#overwatch2 #kiriko #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6YgMMada2A", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Return To Monkey Island Review", "description": "The iconic point-and-click adventure series returns with a heartfelt and nostalgic adventure that any mighty pirate would be a fool to miss.\n\n#gaming #returntomonkeyisland #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4--LplBTNwI", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Diablo 4 End Game Closed Beta Developer Update", "description": "Learn more about Diablo 4's upcoming closed end game beta from Rod Ferguson and Joe Shely. \n\nNow, here\u2019s a run-down of the end game offerings included in the Diablo IV Closed End Game Beta: Helltide, Nightmare Dungeons, Whispers of the Dead, Fields of Hatred, and Paragon Boards.

What was in it? What is Rockstar doing about it? All these questions, answered.\n#Gaming #GTA6 #GrandTheftAuto6 #GTA6Leak \n\nWell, what else is there to talk about? The Grand Theft Auto 6 leak. How did it happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar\u2019s response? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the biggest leak the gaming industry has ever seen.\n\nNow, before we get into this, I just want to be expressly clear. Everything you are about to see is from previous GTA games. Ok. Rockstar\u2019s legal team, if you\u2019re listening\u2014 and I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re big fans of this show\u2014 we\u2019re not showing any screenshots. Any gameplay. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Got it? Ok. Good. Here we go.\n\nSo how did the leak happen? On Sunday September 20, a user that goes by the name of teapottuberhacker posted on GTAforums.com over 90 clips of in-development footage of the game. They claimed that the clips were taken from Rockstar\u2019s internal Slack, which also allowed them to get their hands on source code for the game.\n\nThe hacker updated their post later that day, directing any employees of Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive to contact them via email, as they were \"looking to negotiate a deal.\" There has been no update as of this recording from the hacker.\n\nSo what was released? Well, a metric f*ton.\n\nThe footage in the 90+ clips totalled a near hour of incomplete GTA 6 gameplay. The validity of the footage before Rockstar could confirm the leak came in the form of two key details that lined up with Bloomberg\u2019s report earlier this year about the game. One, all the gameplay took place in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto\u2019s Miami parody, and the location of the game according to Bloomberg's report. \n\nThat report also included the detail that the player would take control of two characters, a man and a woman, whom are meant to be a Bonnie and Clyde-like type pairing. The gameplay seen in the leak featured both a playable man and woman. Pop-up text during the footage refers to the man as Jason and the woman as Lucia.\n\nThe footage showed off the characters\u2019 abilities to crouch, go prone, and move while doing both. Going prone is something that can\u2019t be done in GTA 5, and the only way to crouch in that game is by taking cover behind a low profile object. \n\nBoth of these elements hint that playing stealthily might be a viable course of action in the game, particularly as the footage also reveals a mechanic to pick up bodies that you could then presumably hide.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZGdKumGlIk", "date_published": "2022-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2019: 10 Things You Never Knew", "description": "War\u2026 War never changes.
