LYRICS
Wild heart, standing desk
Great explorer, undersexed
You’ll while away
Till you get jealous
But your next life begins
Today

Drugs aren’t drugs
They’re like freckled hugs
For your brain
Clearly I’ve never done drugs
But I’m wide awake
On my second dose
And my next life begins
Today

On this day we wake up
Stretch our aching body
Toward the glorious unattempted feat
We forgot to put on our calendar

And on this day we lay to rest
The darling girl who did her best
She dreamed within the parameters
Till the dreamer shook her awake

So look beyond and reach again
Unleash your bonds, baptize your friends
The future’s bright as a baby’s eyes
And your next life begins
Your next life begins
Oh your next life begins
Today
