Younger musicians today are rejecting the restrictions of that industry-imposed title and adding contemporary sounds like hip-hop and trap while still maintaining the emotional spirit and rough edges of the genre.\n\nThen there\u2019s Carin Le\u00f3n \u2014 a game changer if there was one. His Tiny Desk (home) concert is a deep dive into this moment in time as the genre actually changes. He starts with a traditional bolero \u201cEl Amor De Tu Vida\u201d but the second song, \u201cAlguien Mejor,\u201d is an example of how he and his amazing group are changing things. It starts with a traditional bajo sexto guitar as he raps and sings the lyrics, but when the mournful strains of a pedal steel guitar popular with trad country music enters the arrangement, the cross cultural reality of life along the border where this music comes from springs to life with the passion of both genres and cultures.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting moment from a four song performance that beautifully represents how a culture changes and develops as outside influences become part of its aesthetic. The music\u2019s rustic roots are on display in the barroom set, complete with strategically placed bleached-out cattle skulls. You still see accordions and cowboy hats in this video but you hear so much more \u2014 you can actually hear a society in transition. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cEl Amor De Tu Vida\u201d \n\u201cAlguien Mejor\u201d\n\u201cNo Es Por Ac\u00e1\u201d\n\u201cLa Primera Cita\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarin Le\u00f3n: vocals\nOrlando Aispuro: guitars, bajo sexto, keys\nAbraham Noe Reyes: guitars\nLuis Carlos Perez: drums, percussion\nMartin Caro: percussion, octapad\nAntonio Z.
