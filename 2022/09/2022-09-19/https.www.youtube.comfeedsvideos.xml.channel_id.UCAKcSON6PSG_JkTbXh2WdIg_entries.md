Built To Spill’s founder and frontman Doug Martsch is, among many things, a collaborator. And that collaborative nature shines brightly on Built To Spill’s latest album, "When The Wind Forgets Your Name," just released on Sept. 9, 2022. The songs were recorded with the musicians Martsch worked with while spending time touring and playing music in Brazil. Now, Martch has teamed up with Melanie Radford and Teresa Esguerra to create the touring version of Built To Spill. While on that tour, Built To Spill visited The Current studio to play songs and to chat with host Mac Wilson.

During the conversation with Mac, we hear more about Radford and Esguerra, and how they came to play with Martsch. We also hear a bit more about Martsch’s time in Brazil — and we enjoy some speculation on just how long the longest Built To Spill song has run in minutes. 

Watch and listen to the full session above.

Nashville-based COIN are currently on tour following the release of their latest album, Uncanny Valley, and its hit single “Chapstick.” During their visit to The Current, the four-piece band — comprising Chase Lawrence, Joe Memmel, Ryan Winnen and Matt Martin — spoke with host Ayisha Jaffer about the band’s origins at Belmont University in Nashville, as well as the themes that arose in their lives and manifested themselves on the album; in particular, themes of relevance and authenticity.

In addition, Lawrence spoke about how the pandemic brought the band closer together, and how community and connection have become so vital to COIN and their fans. One improbable indicator of that connection? The deep, personal significance that can be found in nonsensical lyrics. 

Watch the complete interview above.
