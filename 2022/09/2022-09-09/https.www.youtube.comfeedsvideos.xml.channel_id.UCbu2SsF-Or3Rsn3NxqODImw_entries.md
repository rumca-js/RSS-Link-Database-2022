## Destiny 2 - Touch Of Malice Catalyst Guide

Touch of Malice has a really fun catalyst that requires some detours during the King's Fall raid. In this video we break down how the catalyst puzzles work, as well as the locations of where many of the needed relics will appear. 
#gaming #gamename #gamespot #touchofmalice #kingsfall #oryx #thetakenking #destiny2 #destiny #thewitchqueen #bungie #bungo #ironbanana #courtoforyx #raid #catalyst #exoticquest 

So you just beat King’s Fall and you’re one of the lucky few to see a beautiful shiny exotic drop from the last chest. It’s Touch of Malice! And it kicks major ass, now to unlock the full potential of the excellent exotic scout rifle all you need is the catalyst. Easy right? In this video we’re gonna break down how to get the catalyst, and what it does. I’ll explain verbally how it all works and what you need to know and then will play out the gameplay at the end of each section. Timestamps will be in the video in case you’re lookin for something particular.  

Some things you guys need to keep in mind is that if you are unable to dunk all the relics in time, the relics may spawn in different spots than shown in the video. However in our tests, all the relics still spawned within the same general area. For example in the Golgoroth section, I show relics at Plates One through Four. But if your team is unable to get the relics dunked in time, you may find that one of the relics spawned at Plate Five instead. Just something to keep in mind. 

Once everyone dunks, a hilarious mini-area opens up that was an easter egg from Destiny 1. You’ll see a bunch of launchpads, just hop into one and grab a floating relic and start slamming them down like you’re at an NBA dunk contest. You’ll have a generous amount of time to dunk as many relics as your team possibly can and eventually the catalyst should appear!

## A Plague Tale: Requiem Feels Very Familiar
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amcWrQGUwMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amcWrQGUwMg)

A Plague Tale: Requiem's story and characters have a lot of potential, but the gameplay feels a bit lacking so far.

Requiem takes place shortly after the first game and is set in 14th century France during the Bubonic Plague, at the outset of the Hundred Years' War. Although both games are set in a realistic depiction of France, the story often flirts with gothic supernatural elements. This is easily one of the coolest things about Innocence and Requiem, and what sets it apart from most third-person adventure games. The world is so wonderfully detailed and everything has a macabre sheen to it.

A Plague Tale: Requiem comes to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X on October 13. Be sure to keep an eye out for our review in the coming weeks.

Redemption in Video Games has sadly become a more common story in the modern era with live-service models allowing unfinished games to ship broken or with questionable business practices. But with that model also comes patches, and support for games post-launch that can eventually get games into a state where we no longer regret having spent our money. With enough time and support, like No Man’s Sky, Diablo 3, Destiny, and countless others did eventually turn it around. 

For Battlefield 2042 to redeem itself, it needs to embrace its positives and double down on them while cutting its losses on things that are too far gone to completely rework within a reasonable time. Before all of that, a clean-up phase is necessary to tackle bugs, and some soul-searching is needed to see just what the identity of Battlefield 2042 should be. Does it strive to reach its original ambitions, or does it chart a new path with a potentially new audience. Be sure to drop a like and pop into the comments if there are other games you think have a shot at redemption, or if you’re interested in hearing about the redemption stories of other games.

## I Forced Myself To Play Only Mobile Games

Mobile games are a prominent market in the video game space, filled with millions upon million of players, but Kurt Indovina isn't one of them. However, that's about to change.
#gaming #gamespot #mobilegaming  

In an effort to learn about the vast mobile game market, Kurt locked his consoles up (to eliminate all temptations to play the games he knows and loves) and forced himself to only play mobile games for a week. 

For seven days, Kurt went without his Xbox Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and 3DS, and relied on his iPhone as his sole game console. With no context where to start, he threw himself in the deep end in an attempt to understand the appeal of mobile games, and, quite possibly, find his next favorite game. 

Kurt was familiar with the big games like PUBG, Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, and Diablo Immortal, but he was on a mission to find hidden gems; the games that take advantage of the phone in creative and unconventional ways. And, to his surprise, he found more than just a few games he loved, but formed an entirely new perspective on mobile gaming.

Games featured in the video (and Kurt's personal recommendations):
Florence
Bury Me My Love
Device 6
Songs of Bloom
Pry

## Massive Call of Duty And Warzone Leaks Before Next Showcase | GameSpot News

Warzone is sticking around after the release of Warzone 2, Call of Duty 2024 reportedly has its setting, and Overwatch 2 backlash over battle pass.
#GameSpot #CallOfDuty #Warzone #Overwatch2 

Leaked details on Call of Duty’s future ahead of the franchise’s upcoming Next event, plus uncertainty of Overwatch 2’s battle pass mere weeks before its launch. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

With more information about the standalone Warzone 2 on the horizon as part of the upcoming Call of Duty Next, some fans have wondered what exactly will be happening with the original version of Warzone. Reporter Tom Henderson on Twitter claims the game will be undergoing a name change on November 28, and that "it looks like original Warzone will continue to receive updates/DLC."

It seems the original Warzone going forward will focus primarily on the Caldera map set in the Pacific, which was introduced as part of what Activision Blizzard called "Warzone Pacific" alongside Call of Duty: Vanguard Season 1 in November 2021.

Like its predecessor, Warzone 2 will be launching some time after the October 25 release Modern Warfare 2, and will feature many of that game's mechanics, vehicles, and weapons.

Having Warzone and Warzone 2 coexist does line up with what Activision has said previously about the two battle royales, namely that Warzone will "continue on as a separate experience that will include a continuation of player progression and inventories within that Warzone experience." That means skins, weapons, and unlocks in the original Warzone will not carry over to Warzone 2.

Looking further into the future for Call of Duty, 2024's installment might tell a story about the war in Iraq. Twitter user TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty details in the past, said the campaign for 2024's Call of Duty game will cover what the US government calls Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place years earlier during the Gulf War of the nineties, the event later adapted and dramatized in 2001's Black Hawk Down.

TheGhostOfHope said it will be Raven Software developing the campaign for Call of Duty 2024. Raven also developed the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.

If Call of Duty 2024 is indeed about the Iraq war, the game will likely be contentious. Around 200,000 civilians died as a result of the war, and another game, Six Days in Fallujah, has generated a good amount of debate and discussion for its themes and elements. One could only imagine that the size and popularity of a franchise like Call of Duty addressing those horrific, real life events would result in an even larger discourse.
