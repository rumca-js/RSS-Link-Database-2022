In this video we break down how the catalyst puzzles work, as well as the locations of where many of the needed relics will appear. \n#gaming #gamename #gamespot #touchofmalice #kingsfall #oryx #thetakenking #destiny2 #destiny #thewitchqueen #bungie #bungo #ironbanana #courtoforyx #raid #catalyst #exoticquest \n\nSo you just beat King\u2019s Fall and you\u2019re one of the lucky few to see a beautiful shiny exotic drop from the last chest. It\u2019s Touch of Malice! And it kicks major ass, now to unlock the full potential of the excellent exotic scout rifle all you need is the catalyst. Easy right? In this video we\u2019re gonna break down how to get the catalyst, and what it does. I\u2019ll explain verbally how it all works and what you need to know and then will play out the gameplay at the end of each section. Timestamps will be in the video in case you\u2019re lookin for something particular.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome things you guys need to keep in mind is that if you are unable to dunk all the relics in time, the relics may spawn in different spots than shown in the video. However in our tests, all the relics still spawned within the same general area. For example in the Golgoroth section, I show relics at Plates One through Four. But if your team is unable to get the relics dunked in time, you may find that one of the relics spawned at Plate Five instead. Just something to keep in mind.\u00a0\n\nOnce everyone dunks, a hilarious mini-area opens up that was an easter egg from Destiny 1. You\u2019ll see a bunch of launchpads, just hop into one and grab a floating relic and start slamming them down like you\u2019re at an NBA dunk contest. You\u2019ll have a generous amount of time to dunk as many relics as your team possibly can and eventually the catalyst should appear!\n\nTimestamps\n\n0:00 Intro \n0:29 How The Encounters Work \n1:26 First Puzzle Encounter \n3:05 First Encounter Relic Locations  \n4:50 Second Puzzle Encounter \n5:53 Golgoroth Relic Locations \n8:27 Third Puzzle Encounter\n9:34 Third Encounter Relics Being Dunked \n11:15 Getting The Catalyst", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfIM5PaTowE", "date_published": "2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Isonzo\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Isonzo, including the Madsen machine gun, the Rast & Gasser M1898 revolver, and iconic Italian firearm, the Villar Perosa.\n\n00:00 - Opening\n00:38 - Steyr M1912 \u201cSteyr Hahn\u201d\n02:29 - Lanciabombe \u201cBettica\u201d mortar\n03:36 - Madsen\n04:52 - Fiat Revelli Mod 1914\n07:03 - Mannlicher M95\n09:13 - Rast & Gasser M1898\n10:31 - Beretta Modello 1915\n13:31 - Vetterli-Vitali M1870\n15:41 - Villar Perosa 9mm Mo-15\n17:43 - Mo.91 Carcano Cavalry Carbine\n21:45 - Skoda 7.5cm Gebirgskanone M.1\n23:25 - Ending\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Isonzo and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqwQ767avbM", "date_published": "2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Future Of Assassin's Creed: What Is Project Infinity? | Ubisoft Forward 2022", "description": "Assassin's Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis C\u00f4t\u00e9 talks about Project Infinity, the upcoming hub portal for Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series.

Let\u2019s see where Battlefield 2042 could be in its redemption story.\u00a0\n#gaming #gamename #gamespot #battlefield #bf2042 #2042 #specialists #DICE #redemption #season2 #stranded #newmap #exodus #conquest #battlefieldportal \n\nRedemption in Video Games has sadly become a more common story in the modern era with live-service models allowing unfinished games to ship broken or with questionable business practices. But with that model also comes patches, and support for games post-launch that can eventually get games into a state where we no longer regret having spent our money. With enough time and support, like No Man\u2019s Sky, Diablo 3, Destiny, and countless others did eventually turn it around.\u00a0\n\nFor Battlefield 2042 to redeem itself, it needs to embrace its positives and double down on them while cutting its losses on things that are too far gone to completely rework within a reasonable time. Before all of that, a clean-up phase is necessary to tackle bugs, and some soul-searching is needed to see just what the identity of Battlefield 2042 should be. Does it strive to reach its original ambitions, or does it chart a new path with a potentially new audience. Be sure to drop a like and pop into the comments if there are other games you think have a shot at redemption, or if you\u2019re interested in hearing about the redemption stories of other games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVyyO7zqE1E", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Disney & Marvel Games Showcase Livestream", "description": "Tune in to the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE for announcements, trailers, and reveals for new and upcoming games from Marvel Games, Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studio.\r\n\r\n#gaming #marvel #disney", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R25VBJemceY", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Disney & Marvel Showcase Full Presentation", "description": "Check out the full presentation for the Disney & Marvel showcase.

However, that's about to change.\n#gaming #gamespot #mobilegaming  \n\nIn an effort to learn about the vast mobile game market, Kurt locked his consoles up (to eliminate all temptations to play the games he knows and loves) and forced himself to only play mobile games for a week. \n\nFor seven days, Kurt went without his Xbox Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and 3DS, and relied on his iPhone as his sole game console. With no context where to start, he threw himself in the deep end in an attempt to understand the appeal of mobile games, and, quite possibly, find his next favorite game. \n\nKurt was familiar with the big games like PUBG, Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, and Diablo Immortal, but he was on a mission to find hidden gems; the games that take advantage of the phone in creative and unconventional ways. And, to his surprise, he found more than just a few games he loved, but formed an entirely new perspective on mobile gaming.\n\nGames featured in the video (and Kurt's personal recommendations):\nFlorence\nBury Me My Love\nDevice 6\nSongs of Bloom\nPry\nPatterned", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu6eT2V1wIA", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Midnight Suns Full Presentation | Disney & Marvel Games Showcase", "description": "Marvel's Midnight Suns got an all new gameplay trailer during the Disney & Marvel Games Showcase showing off its bewildering amount of characters and its high stakes battles.

All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nWith more information about the standalone Warzone 2 on the horizon as part of the upcoming Call of Duty Next, some fans have wondered what exactly will be happening with the original version of Warzone. Reporter Tom Henderson on Twitter claims the game will be undergoing a name change on November 28, and that \"it looks like original Warzone will continue to receive updates/DLC.\"\n\nIt seems the original Warzone going forward will focus primarily on the Caldera map set in the Pacific, which was introduced as part of what Activision Blizzard called \"Warzone Pacific\" alongside Call of Duty: Vanguard Season 1 in November 2021.\n\nLike its predecessor, Warzone 2 will be launching some time after the October 25 release Modern Warfare 2, and will feature many of that game's mechanics, vehicles, and weapons.\n\nHaving Warzone and Warzone 2 coexist does line up with what Activision has said previously about the two battle royales, namely that Warzone will \"continue on as a separate experience that will include a continuation of player progression and inventories within that Warzone experience.\" That means skins, weapons, and unlocks in the original Warzone will not carry over to Warzone 2.\n\nLooking further into the future for Call of Duty, 2024's installment might tell a story about the war in Iraq. Twitter user TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty details in the past, said the campaign for 2024's Call of Duty game will cover what the US government calls Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place years earlier during the Gulf War of the nineties, the event later adapted and dramatized in 2001's Black Hawk Down.\n\nTheGhostOfHope said it will be Raven Software developing the campaign for Call of Duty 2024. Raven also developed the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.\n\nIf Call of Duty 2024 is indeed about the Iraq war, the game will likely be contentious. Around 200,000 civilians died as a result of the war, and another game, Six Days in Fallujah, has generated a good amount of debate and discussion for its themes and elements. One could only imagine that the size and popularity of a franchise like Call of Duty addressing those horrific, real life events would result in an even larger discourse.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:13 - Warzone \n01:21 - Call of Duty 2024\n02:24 - Overwatch 2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJlsvDZkez0", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Splatoon 3 is Familiar But Great! | GameSpot After Dark Ep 161", "description": "This week the crew talks Splatoon 3, our hands-on with A Plague Tale: Requiem, and The Rings of Power show.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:03:01 - A Plague Tale: Requiem\n0:21:28 - Splatoon 3\n0:40:25 - Streets of Rage 4 Mobile\n0:41:41 - Swipe Mobile Showcase\n0:48:14 - House of the Dragon & The Rings of Power\n1:08:51 - Jojo Stone Ocean\n1:13:24 - Dark\n1:14:44 - Question of the Week\n1:32:38 - Outro\n\n#gaming #splatoon3 #plaguetale", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0cZd9vNbg", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Untitled Black Panther and Captain America Game Reveal Trailer | Disney & Marvel Games Showcase", "description": "From Marvel and Skydance New Media comes this take on Hydra, Captain America, and Black Panther.
