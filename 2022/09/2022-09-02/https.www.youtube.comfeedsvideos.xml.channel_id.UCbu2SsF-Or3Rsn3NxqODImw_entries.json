Although known for crafting some of the most immersive worlds through their storytelling and stunning (as well as horrifying) visuals; Naughty Dog has spared no expense when it comes to their secrets. Spanning both games, Naughty Dog has sneakily hidden a ton of in-references, along with other fun connections to the greater world outside of Joel and Ellie's zombie stricken landscape. These secrets don\u2019t necessarily jump out at you to take you away from the moment to moment action, but rather they fill in the gaps and make the world immensely rich and layered experience.

Alongside its game, the company will also share some new information on the Cyberpunk Edgerunners series coming to Netflix soon that had a very NSFW trailer recently.\u00a0\n\nThis new Night City episode will be streamed at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET on September 6, but while we wait for that, let\u2019s go over the story details for the upcoming expansion that appeared to have leaked online back in May 2022.\u00a0\n\nAccording to VGC, which saw the leaked files and first reported on them, hundreds of lines of dialogue spelling out most of the events and characters of the expansion have appeared online. The dialogue points to a character named Songbird, who was datamined in Cyberpunk 2077, being the focus of the DLC. The expansion will reportedly take players to the Combat Zone and Sports Dome, which were both previously inaccessible spots across Cyberpunk 2077's setting Night City.\n\nWhile the side missions seem to mostly contain placeholder text, enough of the dialogue throughout shows that Johnny Silverhand, an AI of a rockstar played by Keanu Reeves, may have a more diminished presence in the expansion, though it's unknown exactly why that may be the case. That may come as a disappointment and shocker to many fans of Cyberpunk 2077, since Reeves' involvement was a major selling point for the game and a significant part of the title's marketing efforts once it re-emerged in 2019.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:09 - Cyberpunk 2077\n01:53 - Xbox Game Pass", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URLcYgZgynE", "date_published": "2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "GameSpot Swipe Mobile Showcase - What to Expect", "description": "Tune in for Swipe, GameSpot\u2019s first ever mobile games showcase.
