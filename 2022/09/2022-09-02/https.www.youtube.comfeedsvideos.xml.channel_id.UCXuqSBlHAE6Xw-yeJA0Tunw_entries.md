Colorful released an AIO PC with a huge display for $2000. Not an outrageous price, but is it really a good idea to put laptop hardware in a desktop setting? At such a large screen size, is it even portable or tastefully small on your desk? And just how long until the components and the 32" screen attached to them are basically all e-waste?
