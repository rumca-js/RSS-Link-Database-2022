<p>Ten years ago, Teenage Engineering made a splash with the quirky, “boutique” OP-1 synthesizer. The b-word gets quotes because <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-14-teenage-engineering-op-1-synthesizer-now-available-for-pre-order.html">the OP-1</a> would go on to be a huge hit, enjoying a 10 year run and several re-stocks along the way. The success of the OP-1 and the equally unique products that followed saw big brands lining up to collaborate in the hope that  some of that design magi

It has become obvious over the last few weeks, as Sony released a handful of preview videos ahead of today's release, that that wouldn’t be the case. Instead, the goal was to <a href="https://www.e
