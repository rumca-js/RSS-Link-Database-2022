Tiny Desk and Jazz Night in America celebrate the 20th anniversary of Juilliard Jazz with three Tiny Desk concerts featuring performances by current students and alumni of the prestigious institution.\n\nWhen the starry-eyed students of the Juilliard Jazz Ensemble first saw the Tiny Desk, they stopped short, exuding awe and wonderment. After all, several of their favorite artists had performed in this very space \u2014 and now here they were, ready to prove themselves and carry on the legacy of both the Tiny Desk and jazz.\n\nThe Juilliard Jazz Ensemble performed at the Tiny Desk in celebration of the jazz studies program's 20th anniversary. Made up of current students, the ensemble embodies the spirit of community and collaboration that is an essential part of the students' learning experience.\n\nThe ensemble opens with \"June\" a hypnotic composition by alto saxophonist Coby Petricone-Berg. We understand immediately despite the members' relative youth, this ensemble is not to be trifled with. A shout-out to the rhythm section is absolutely necessary, as drummer John Sturino, bassist Nico Martinez and pianist Esteban Castro lay back in the cut while ensuring the path ahead for the horns, with Jasim Perales giving us soulful trombone, is smooth like whipped shea butter. This is grade-A musicianship \u2014 everyone listening and unselfishly supporting each other.\n\nFor the final selection, Ekep Nkwelle presents her arrangement of Geri Allen's \"Timeless Portraits and Dreams.\" Her voice soars in this contemplative ballad, a perfect closer that allows each member of the ensemble to shine as they share the hope that, \"In tomorrow's world, let joy and love run free / Let's hold on to our dreams.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"June\" (Coby Petricone-Berg)\n\"Timeless Portraits and Dreams\" (Geri Allen, arr.
