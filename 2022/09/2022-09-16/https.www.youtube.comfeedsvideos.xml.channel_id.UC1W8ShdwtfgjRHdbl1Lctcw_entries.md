I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of California Late 1940s you can clearly see what is going on during the day in residential area, many beautiful houses with gardens, we can see that it's the end of the 40s with a 1949 ford,

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
