The Lancet Commission on lessons for the future from the 
COVID-19 pandemic 

14th September 2022

WHO response

WHO acted too cautiously and too slowly

Several important matters

To warn about human transmissibility of the virus

To declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern

To support international travel protocols designed to slow the spread of the virus

(This delay contributed to the spread of the virus and limited the possibilities for risk mitigation.)

To endorse the public use of face masks as protective gear

To recognise the airborne transmission of the virus.

(These delayed and vague recommendations from WHO continued until late April, 2021.) 

Just 1 example, after receiving an open letter

From 238 scientists in July, 2020,

asking the organisation to address airborne transmission

WHO did not change until April 30, 2021.

Multiple failures of international cooperation

Too many governments have failed to adhere to basic norms of institutional rationality and transparency, 

and the world's major powers have failed to collaborate to control the pandemic.

Specific points

Lack of timely notification of the initial outbreak of COVID-19

Costly delays in acknowledging the crucial airborne exposure pathway of SARS-CoV-2, 

and in implementing appropriate measures at national and global levels to slow the spread of the virus.

Lack of coordination among countries regarding suppression strategies

Failure of governments to examine evidence and adopt best practices for controlling the pandemic,

and managing economic and social spillovers

Shortfall of global funding for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs)

Failure to ensure adequate global supplies and equitable distribution of key commodities,

protective gear, diagnostics, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines

Lack of timely, accurate, systematic data

Infections, deaths, viral variants, health system responses, and indirect health consequences

Again the report raised lab leak possibility

Poor enforcement of appropriate levels of biosafety regulations in the lead-up to the pandemic, 

raising the possibility of a laboratory-related outbreak

Failure to combat systematic disinformation

Lack of global and national safety nets to protect populations experiencing vulnerability.

As of May 31, 2022

There were 6·9 million reported deaths and 17·2 million estimated deaths from COVID-19

Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend

This staggering death toll is both a profound tragedy and a massive global failure at multiple levels. 

Sustainable development process

Set back by several years, 

Deep underfinancing, Sustainable Development Goals and,

aims of the Paris Climate Agreement.
