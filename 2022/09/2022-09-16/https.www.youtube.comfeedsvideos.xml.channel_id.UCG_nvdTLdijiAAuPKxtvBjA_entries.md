Thor: Love and Thunder reunites Thor with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster, who has now become a Thor as well, to take down the evil Gorr played by Christian Bale. Obviously this movie overall is yet another 10/10 as you can always expect from Marvel, but there is one negative aspect here as well: the villain. For some reason Gorr becomes another bland and forgettable MCU villain that you're gonna forget as soon as the movie ends, even despite Christian Bale. We already touched on this topic with Wanda in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but let's look for a couple more reasons why Marvel villains suck and how to avoid those problems ourselves.
