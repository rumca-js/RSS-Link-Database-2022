2022\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01585-9/fulltext\n\nhttps://covid19commission.org\n\nWHO response\n\nWHO acted too cautiously and too slowly\n\nSeveral important matters\n\nTo warn about human transmissibility of the virus\n\nTo declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\n\nTo support international travel protocols designed to slow the spread of the virus\n\n(This delay contributed to the spread of the virus and limited the possibilities for risk mitigation.)\n\nTo endorse the public use of face masks as protective gear\n\nTo recognise the airborne transmission of the virus.\n\n(These delayed and vague recommendations from WHO continued until late April, 2021.) \n\nJust 1 example, after receiving an open letter\n\nFrom 238 scientists in July, 2020,\n\nasking the organisation to address airborne transmission\n\nWHO did not change until April 30, 2021.\n\nMultiple failures of international cooperation\n\nToo many governments have failed to adhere to basic norms of institutional rationality and transparency, \n\nand the world's major powers have failed to collaborate to control the pandemic.\n\nSpecific points\n\nLack of timely notification of the initial outbreak of COVID-19\n\nCostly delays in acknowledging the crucial airborne exposure pathway of SARS-CoV-2, \n\nand in implementing appropriate measures at national and global levels to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nLack of coordination among countries regarding suppression strategies\n\nFailure of governments to examine evidence and adopt best practices for controlling the pandemic,\n\nand managing economic and social spillovers\n\nShortfall of global funding for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs)\n\nFailure to ensure adequate global supplies and equitable distribution of key commodities,\n\nprotective gear, diagnostics, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines\n\nLack of timely, accurate, systematic data\n\nInfections, deaths, viral variants, health system responses, and indirect health consequences\n\nAgain the report raised lab leak possibility\n\nPoor enforcement of appropriate levels of biosafety regulations in the lead-up to the pandemic, \n\nraising the possibility of a laboratory-related outbreak\n\nFailure to combat systematic disinformation\n\nLack of global and national safety nets to protect populations experiencing vulnerability.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022\n\nThere were 6\u00b79 million reported deaths and 17\u00b72 million estimated deaths from COVID-19\n\nInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\n\nhttps://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend\n\nThis staggering death toll is both a profound tragedy and a massive global failure at multiple levels. \n\nSustainable development process\n\nSet back by several years, \n\nDeep underfinancing, Sustainable Development Goals and,\n\naims of the Paris Climate Agreement. \n\nPrevious
