Taking place after the main campaign, the DLC will act as an epilogue of sorts as players take control of Rose Winters, who seeks to be rid of her powers.\n\nUnlike the main game, Shadow of Rose is exclusively in the 3rd person perspective, putting it more in line with the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The section of the game we got to play takes place in Castle Dimitrescu. The castle is now covered in a goopy red substance and filled a new type of enemy called the face eaters.

We recently got a chance to play Wo Long's PlayStation 5 demo, which gives a look at the game's combat and a variety of its systems.\n\nThe notable thing about Wo Long is how fast and aggressive it is, while maintaining some of the underlying foundations of Souls-like games. Enemies hit hard and are often unblockable, forcing you to adapt and adjust to their strategies, but you can also overwhelm them with strikes and dodges thanks to the game's \"spirit\" system, which replaces the usual stamina gauge. That creates a tug-of-war-like take on combat, where you have to know when to block and when to attack, overwhelming your enemy so they don't overwhelm you.\n\nWo Long is also tough. The footage here is a sort of \"new game plus\" version of the demo, allowing you to start over but keeping your equipment and character level. If it looks like we're tearing through this demo, it's because we're a bit overleveled in order to give you a cleaner, speedier look at the gameplay (although we still died a few times along the way).\n\n#wolongfallendynasty #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoLOT0wb6g", "date_published": "2022-09-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer and Warzone 2.0 Details", "description": "Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 just had a bunch of details released on its multiplayer as well as Warzone 2.0.

Crisis Core Reunion is brings the game to modern systems with updated graphics and gameplay.\n#crisiscorereunion #crisiscore #ffvii \n\nGameSpot's very own Phil Hornshaw had a chance to go hands-on with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy Reunion at a Square Enix event, where he was able to check how the updated graphics and gameplay felt.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake set a high bar for reviving a classic game, both retelling the original game's story and altering it in key ways to create something new. Crisis Core is a prequel to the original FFVII, but despite its links to FFVII Remake's revised story, producer Mariko Sato previously told GameSpot that Reunion is hewing closely to the original Crisis Core's story. That's what we saw in the demo as well--the story and cutscenes of Crisis Core Reunion seem extremely similar to what was in the original game. The primary changes and improvements are in Reunion's combat.\n\nCrisis Core keeps all its fighting in real-time--using your special abilities, magic spells, or healing items is done with by pressing different combinations of buttons, and there's no break in the action like in FFVII Remake. With Crisis Core Reunion, however, it's clear that the movement, melee fighting, and camera systems have been tuned up, making the combat feel like a Crisis Core spin on FFVII Remake's foundation.\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is set to release on December 13, 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpwKqHLvWO0", "date_published": "2022-09-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk Edgerunners Rules | GameSpot After Dark Ep 162", "description": "Its been a heck of a week, both good and bad, but at least the weekend is finally here!

This is more than double Cyberpunk 2077's August high of 16,000 players and is presumably thanks in part to the Edgerunners update that added a substantial number of new features and improvements.\n\nMoving right along to some fighting games. One day after Capcom's TGS 2022 Special Program showcased new modes, characters, and a closed beta test for Street Fighter 6, a separate presentation has confirmed the launch roster for the game through an intro video. The presentation showed the introduction to the game's single-player story mode World Tour, which showcases the entire roster as a narrator talks over the video. All 11 confirmed characters were shown, as were seven previously unknown fighters.\n\nIn other fighting game news, Tekken 8 director Katsuhiro Harada has revealed even more info about what we can expect from the fighting game sequel during an interview with IGN. Aside from more exciting father versus son showdowns, Tekken 8 is built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. None of Tekken 7 has been re-used, and Harada was excited to describe the impressive in-game footage. As for the story, Harada called Tekken 8 a turning point and promised that the story mode hasn't been shrunk from what players saw from Tekken 7. Looking toward the future, Harada expressed optimism about the longevity of fighting games. Harada also said he was interested in how the fighting game scene will shift, commenting on the transition from arcade to console, and now what could possibly happen in the future.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:07 - Cyberpunk 2077\n01:23 - Street Fighter 6\n02:22 - Tekken 8", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOSV1yeboq4", "date_published": "2022-09-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Gameplay Presentation | Koei Tecmo TGS 2022", "description": "Check out over 10 minutes of gameplay that was shown off during the Koei Tecmo 2022 showcase.

The action game studio has already given its spin to the Soulslike genre with the Nioh games. In Wo Long, Team Ninja once again borrows some of the underpinnings of From Software's lauded series, but takes a faster, more Ninja Gaiden-like approach. It's some of the same ideas but with a different feel, which will challenge action game fans in a lot of different ways.\n\nGameSpot got an early look at Wo Long's playable demo on PlayStation 5, which gives a snapshot of the game's combat systems. A lot of the foundation will be familiar to Soulslike fans--enemies hit hard and are tough to kill, often sporting unblockable or uninterruptible animations. Whenever you stop to rest at a checkpoint, enemies respawn, forcing you to fight them again. Healing is limited to a small set of flasks you carry, and using them takes a very long time, leaving you open to attack. Most fights come down to analyzing or memorizing enemy attack patterns so you can exploit weaknesses and avoid taking an abundance of damage.\n\nBut as mentioned, Wo Long takes a much faster and more aggressive approach to that foundation than most other Soulslike games, making it most comparable to something like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Wo Long focuses on Chinese martial arts, and thus, much of its gameplay is about speedy strikes and redirecting your opponent's force. Its biggest adjustment from similar games, though, is that it drops the usual stamina gauge that dictates how many moves you can make before you stall out.\n\nInstead, Wo Long sports a \"spirit\" gauge, which dictates how much you can block or dodge, as well as special abilities, like martial arts or magical \"wizardry\" attacks. The spirit gauge is less of a limitation than it is a gamble, though. The gauge starts at zero in the center, with a negative and positive side. When you take damage, block attacks, dodge, or use your special abilities, you \"lose\" spirit, so the gauge pushes into the negative. If your gauge fully fills up on the negative side, a hit from an enemy will stagger you, leaving you vulnerable for a long time.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA8j-g3BqU", "date_published": "2022-09-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
