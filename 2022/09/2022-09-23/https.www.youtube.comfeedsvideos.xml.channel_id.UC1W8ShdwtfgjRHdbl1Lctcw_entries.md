I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of New York 1930's, the first Fifth Avenue in New York. We could start by the 60th, that's what we do. We follow a bus, and pass in front of many buildings while Central Park, after we pass, a city in the middle of the night with the rain, we can see stores open, people walking under the rain, after Lots of movie theaters. It's hard to see, but you can see names of cinemas like the Mayfair, the Roxy and the Tivoli, before it opened to the wonders of Time Square. 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
