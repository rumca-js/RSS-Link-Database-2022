Alexa customers can listen to The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring audiobook on Alexa, free for 60 days (8/15 to 10/13)! Just say, “Alexa, read The Fellowship of The Ring…” And watch new episodes of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” Fridays on Prime Video. Audible is your go-to for Lord of the Rings: Book 1, now available FREE on Alexa through 10/13. Offer only available in the U.S. and Canada.
The Office ran for years, but when was it at its best? In this video I go over my favorite seasons of NBC's hit sitcom (that most saw through Netflix) as well as the ones I don't think worked.
