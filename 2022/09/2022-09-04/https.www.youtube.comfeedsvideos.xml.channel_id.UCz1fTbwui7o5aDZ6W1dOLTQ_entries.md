Writing dialogue is probably the most difficult challenge a writer can face. That goes double for comic books. Many people have asked for a video on writing dialogue, but I don't think just one video would cover such a task. So this will be the first video in a new series where I edit one page from a modern mainstream comic.

Today's pick is a page from Tom King's "Heroes in Crisis" by #dccomics #dcuniverse
