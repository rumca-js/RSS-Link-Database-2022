I colorized, restored and created a sound design of this video of Union Station, Washington D.C 1930s, built as part of a beautification project initiated in 1901 for Washington DC. This project aimed to build facilities that were not only practical, but also appropriate for a capital city, The first train arrived at Union Station on October 27, 1907 from Pittsburgh. The station was very busy, with up to 200,000 people a day passing through its corridors before 1945.
