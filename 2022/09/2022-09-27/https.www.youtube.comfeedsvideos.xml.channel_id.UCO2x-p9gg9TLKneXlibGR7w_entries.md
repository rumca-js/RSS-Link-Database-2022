The Valve Steam Deck is a lot of people's first Linux device. When it first hit the scene in early 2022, gamers went wild for a handheld without platform lockout and with access to a large portion of Steam Libraries everywhere. The Proton compatibility layer enabling Direct3D games to run on Linux opened up a world of opportunities, fiddling, modding, and more. No group of users are more enthusiastic than Deck owners and while I've been loving mine, I can't help but hate the display. I upgraded my base screen to the 512GB anti-reflective display but that didn't do it for me either. It lacked contrast, dynamic range, luminence, and more. Returning to my Nintendo Switch OLED, colors seemed more vibrant, highlights popped, and more. Until we get a Deck OLED upgrade, there's another way you can bring amazing quality displays to the Steam Deckâ€”and that's with the Nreal Air.
