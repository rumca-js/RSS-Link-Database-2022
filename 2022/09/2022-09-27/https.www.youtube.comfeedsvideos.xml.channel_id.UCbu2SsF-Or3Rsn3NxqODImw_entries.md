October’s free PlayStation Plus games have been officially revealed and the alleged GTA 6 hacker appeared in court. 
#GamingNews #PSPlus #GTA6 

PlayStation has announced the PS plus free games lineup for October 2022 and remember, all tiers of PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to claim these starting October 4. Hot Wheels Unleashed is an arcade racing game that was released last year to pretty solid reviews. Even though it's five years old at this point, Injustice 2 still looks and plays great. It features a ton of unique content, including a wonderfully made story mode and a boatload of challenges with unique rewards. The lineup is rounded out by Superhot, one of the best indie games in recent years. Superhot is a first-person shooter that plays like a puzzle game. 

Switching gears to GTA now. 

London police have arrested a 17-year-old suspected of perpetrating the recent hack on Rockstar Games, which resulted in the unprecedented leaking of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage. As reported by Eurogamer, the suspect entered a not-guilty plea related to computer misuse, but did plead guilty to violating bail conditions. The arrest, made on September 22, was announced by the City of London Police Twitter account the following day. In its initial post, the police department did not specify if the hacker, described as a "17-year-old in Oxfordshire," was suspected of hacking Rockstar Games. However, it did say it was "part of an investigation" made in collaboration with the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit.

Halo is much more than just a game. The series is a cultural touchstone that has become a pillar in the shooter genre. So in honor of the 15th anniversary of Halo 3 this month, I wanted to focus on one of the most influential shooters of all time. These are ten things you never knew about Halo 3.
#gaming #Halo #gamespot #Bungie 

Stu here to break down the hidden secrets and fun facts about Halo 3. Halo, especially the Bungie-made entries, are regarded as some of the most prestigious shooters in video games. They tell a compelling and highly praised story and offer a plethora of multiplayer options that are bar none in the industry. I love that the devs were able to add some ridiculous secrets and easter eggs in Halo 3. Now all I want to do is get in some crazy gravity hammer battles on Narrows.

In today’s GameSpot News, we discuss Overwatch 2 locking the original game’s heroes for new players as well as MultiVersus doubling the leveling requirement.
#GamingNews #Overwatch2 #MultiVersus

According to Blizzard's blog post, new players are those who are making their accounts post-Overwatch 2 launch and aren't those who already have an account in Overwatch.

New players will first begin with a restricted pool of modes and heroes. In the first half of Overwatch 2's First Time User Experience, they'll unlock all the modes. In the second half, players will progressively obtain original Overwatch heroes. It will take 100 matches to unlock the full original roster.

The game’s 1.03 patch will increase the amount of experience needed to level up a single character between levels 3 and 15, as the developers found that "players could get to level 15 of the mastery track too quickly." MultiVersus fans reacted to the change over on the game’s subreddit with memes and long threads about whether or not this is a positive change. One of the suggestions a handful of users think would help the experience is the addition of more rewards after level 15. Another user suggested making a character’s gameplay related perks complete at level 10 and make everything above 10 cosmetic or currency.
