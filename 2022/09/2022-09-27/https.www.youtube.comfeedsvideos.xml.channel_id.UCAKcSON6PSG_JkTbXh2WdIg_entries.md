On the release of their new album, "Spark," Chicago band Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek visited The Current to play songs and to chat with host Mac Wilson.

Ehrlich and Kakacek not only discuss the writing of what became "Spark," they also share what’s important to them when searching for a place to call home, and what it’s like to be able to hold a physical copy of their records. And despite being based in Chicago, Ehrlich and Kakacek also share their special memories about Minneapolis record store Electric Fetus as well as our very on studio at The Current.
