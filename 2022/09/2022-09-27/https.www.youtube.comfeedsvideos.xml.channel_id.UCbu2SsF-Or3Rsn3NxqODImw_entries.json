Hot Wheels Unleashed is an arcade racing game that was released last year to pretty solid reviews. Even though it's five years old at this point, Injustice 2 still looks and plays great. It features a ton of unique content, including a wonderfully made story mode and a boatload of challenges with unique rewards. The lineup is rounded out by Superhot, one of the best indie games in recent years. Superhot is a first-person shooter that plays like a puzzle game.\u00a0\n\nSwitching gears to GTA now.\u00a0\n\nLondon police have arrested a 17-year-old suspected of perpetrating the recent hack on Rockstar Games, which resulted in the unprecedented leaking of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage. As reported by Eurogamer, the suspect entered a not-guilty plea related to computer misuse, but did plead guilty to violating bail conditions. The arrest, made on September 22, was announced by the City of London Police Twitter account the following day. In its initial post, the police department did not specify if the hacker, described as a \"17-year-old in Oxfordshire,\" was suspected of hacking Rockstar Games. However, it did say it was \"part of an investigation\" made in collaboration with the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - PS Plus\n01:39 - GTA 6\n02:51 - Call of Duty & Cyberpunk 2077", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRz7gP0B5wY", "date_published": "2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "WILD HEARTS Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "Master ancient tech to hunt down giant beasts.

In the first half of Overwatch 2's First Time User Experience, they'll unlock all the modes. In the second half, players will progressively obtain original Overwatch heroes. It will take 100 matches to unlock the full original roster.\n\nThe game\u2019s 1.03 patch will increase the amount of experience needed to level up a single character between levels 3 and 15, as the developers found that \"players could get to level 15 of the mastery track too quickly.\" MultiVersus fans reacted to the change over on the game\u2019s subreddit with memes and long threads about whether or not this is a positive change. One of the suggestions a handful of users think would help the experience is the addition of more rewards after level 15. Another user suggested making a character\u2019s gameplay related perks complete at level 10 and make everything above 10 cosmetic or currency.\u00a0\n\nFull Patch Notes:\u00a0\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-1-03-patch-adds-rick-sanchez-makes-shaggy-free-for-all-new-players/1100-6507834/\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Overwatch 2\n02:13 - MultiVersus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3HZu8qS6UQ", "date_published": "2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Overwatch 2 launches October 4!\n\nPrepare yourselves for a  one-of-a-kind, action-packed, free-to-play experience with new maps, new modes, and new heroes.\n\n#overwatch2 #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53c0mcwJd6Q", "date_published": "2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
