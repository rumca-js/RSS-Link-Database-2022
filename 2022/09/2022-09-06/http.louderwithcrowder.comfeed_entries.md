Absolutely nothing former president Donald Trump ever said has come even close. And it'

This is especially true when it comes to the subject of abortion. "No uterus. No opinion," right? That's the leftist line. And there are no greater strongholds for abortion and this kind of ignorant thinking than deep blue cities like New

And she still played second fiddle to Amber (in my opinion). But I guess she's been doing other things and recently directed <em>Don't Worry Darling</em> starring Chris Pine and world-renowned girly-boy and closeted homosexual Harry Styles, and in an intervi

She's speaking out about how Americans need to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us. Then I saw she means having a different political opinion than <em>HER</em> is killing people, and that she can't even with them anymore.</p><

Or really any kind of a Republican? If you are, Joe Biden hates you and thinks you are a domestic enemy. Get ready because Crowder is coming in hot. Also, there was a mass stabbing in Canada, where the prime minister says citizens don't have a right to self-defense. And a lesbian gets her tubes tied. <br /></p><

As part of this all-ages back-to-school extravaganza, they hired male dancer "Jenna Tailia." It's a sexual euphemism for "genitalia," which is otherwise known as the reproductive organs. Also, "all-ages" and "back-to-school" means children. </p>

New York governor Kathy Hochul responded with new soon-to-be unconstitutional gun laws. According to a leaked memo, that includes a directive for law enforcement to assume guilt unless proven othe
