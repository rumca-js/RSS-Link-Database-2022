I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of the Los Angeles freeways from the early 1950's to the mid to early 1960's, you can clearly see what is going on during the day, the first part is from the 1950's the latest model cars seen here are 1954 Buicks and 1954 Cadillacs, After 2:30 the second part is the early 1960's, lots of cars with Mercury Comets and Plymouth Valiant's. Otherwise, some Packard's, Caddy's Fords, Mercury Turnpike Cruiser and Buick's.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
