In March of 2022, Franz Ferdinand released the double-album set, 'Hits To The Head,' which features 18 hits from the band’s back catalogue as well as two new tracks. While Franz Ferdinand were on tour to promote the double album, they visited The Current studio to perform three tracks from the collection, including this song, “Take Me Out” (originally on 2004’s self-titled album).

Built To Spill’s founder and frontman Doug Martsch is, among many things, a collaborator. And that collaborative nature shines brightly on Built To Spill’s latest album, "When The Wind Forgets Your Name," just released on Sept. 9, 2022. The songs were recorded with the musicians Martsch worked with while spending time touring and playing music in Brazil. Now, Martch has teamed up with Melanie Radford and Teresa Esguerra to create the touring version of Built To Spill. While on that tour, Built To Spill visited The Current studio to play songs and to chat with host Mac Wilson.

During the conversation with Mac, we hear more about Radford and Esguerra, and how they came to play with Martsch. We also hear a bit more about Martsch’s time in Brazil — and we enjoy some speculation on just how long the longest Built To Spill song has run in minutes. 

Watch and listen to the full session above.
