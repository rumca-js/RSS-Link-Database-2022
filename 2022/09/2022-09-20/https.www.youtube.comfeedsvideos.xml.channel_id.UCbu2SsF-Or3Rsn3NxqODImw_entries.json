All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nLogitech has a gaming handheld, that can play games like Halo Infinite, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. But there\u2019s a catch\u2014 it\u2019s all done via streaming.\n\nVia services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now, this device will allow you to take your games on the go\u2026 As long as you have a WiFi connection, because there\u2019s zero options for cellular.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cis there anything this can do that my phone with a controller grip can\u2019t?\u201d the answer is no, there seemingly isn\u2019t. And if you own a handheld like the Steam Deck that can play dedicated PC games, those also allow you to access the same streaming services, although the process to set them up is a little more complicated on those devices.\n\nThere is one area that the Logitech G Cloud gaming handheld succeeds in and that is battery life. If you don\u2019t want to drain your phone\u2019s power, Logitech\u2019s handheld will provide up to 12 hours of battery life. It also sports a 7-inch, 1080p LCD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate. You\u2019d think with a price tag of $350, matching the OLED Switch, it would pack an OLED screen. \n\nIf this incredibly niche product speaks to you, then pre-ordering ahead of its October 15th launch will nab you a $50 discount.\n\nOn the console side, Xbox has put out a fun update for its users. With this latest update you'll be able to change the Xbox button color on any Series 2 Elite controller. You can do so in the Xbox Accessories app on your Xbox console or PC, as long as your controller is connected. Alongside this, Xbox has released its Elite Series 2 Core controller, a white version of the device that excludes additional items such as the backpedals and swappable thumbsticks for a lower price point fo $130. Those items can be purchased in an additional accessory pack for $60.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3qJGYhFbQI", "date_published": "2022-09-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "SCORN 8 Minute Official 4K Prologue Gameplay", "description": "Take a look at 8 minutes of new Scorn gameplay and prepare to take your first few steps into Scorn\u2019s truly unsettling hellscape next month.

Developer Ebb Software says that it pulled from the works of Swiss artist H. R. Giger and Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski when constructing its part flesh, part machine world--injecting Giger's biomechanical art style into Beksi\u0144ski's dystopian surrealism.\n\nScorn is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC on October 21.

No two of these games are the same, but Gun Interactive is one of a very small number of studios to work on a second, separate franchise within the genre. For the studio, moving from the misty Camp Crystal Lake to the oppressive Texas heat is an undertaking that goes beyond setting and scenery.\n\nThe game plays in 4v3 matches where four victims--notably not named \"survivors,\" but instead \"victims\"--awaken already ensnared by the Slaughter family that consists of the hitchhiker, the cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. In the 50 years since the original Tobe Hooper movie shocked audiences with its unflinching portrayals of violence, Leatherface has outgrown his own series in a way, partly due to marketing decisions, Keltner believes. As slashers blew up in the 1980s, Leatherface had to become the series' mascot, its face of evil who could stand tall next to Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and the rest. But the original movie was much more focused on the family as a whole, so, in being a recreation of sorts of that 1974 film, the game does this too.\n\nFaithful video game adaptations of other visual media can uniquely immerse players who bring with them a level of familiarity, and for me today, that means an eagerness to get back into that house despite knowing the horrors that await within it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSURf0yQCOg", "date_published": "2022-09-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 with NVIDIA DLSS 3 & Ray Tracing Overdrive Mode Trailer", "description": "Experience Cyberpunk 2077 like never before with incredible visuals of Night City enhanced by the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode and up to 4 times the performance increase with NVIDIA DLSS 3, coming soon.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure RPG set in the dark future of Night City a dangerous megalopolis obsessed with power, glamor, and ceaseless body modification.\n\n#cyberpunk2077 #nvidia #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggHvchi_XeI", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New PS5 Reportedly Releasing In 2023 | GameSpot News", "description": "A new, slim PlayStation 5 next year, Nvidia's 4000 series GeForce GPUs, Cyberpunk visual updates, and an Iron Man game from EA.\n#Gaming #Cyberpunk #PS5 \n\nHas the PlayStation 5 Slim been revealed? Plus, Nvidia\u2019s new (expensive) graphics cards, new Cyberpunk updates for them, and yet another Marvel game announcement. All on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nA new version of the PlayStation 5 will be released in 2023 featuring a detachable disk drive, according to a new report from Tom Henderson at Insider-Gaming. Sources told the site that this new model of the PS5 has been in production since the PS5 launched in November 2020.\n\nThe new remodel will reportedly feature a detachable disc drive, and will connect to the PS5 via a USB-C port on the back of the console. The site went on to claim that the PS5 will be sold on its own or in a bundle with the detachable disk drive, while these rumored disc drives will be made available for sale separately.\n\nThe new PS5 model is said to be \"slimmer and lighter\" than the current system. The report had no mention of pricing.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough hardware for you, Nvidia finally unveiled their 4000 series cards, and\u2026 well they\u2019re not cheap.\n\nThe RTX 4090 is Nvidia's new flagship GPU, shipping with 24GB of GDDR6X memory. Nvidia claims that it will be able to deliver framerates higher than 100fps when gaming at 4K, all while consuming the same amount of power as the RTX 3090 Ti. \n\nUsing DLSS 3, the latest version of Nvidia's AI based up-resing tech, Nvidia says that the RTX 4090 sees four times more performance than the RTX 3090 Ti using DLSS 2. The RTX 4090 starts at $1599 and launches on October 12.\n\nThe RTX 4080 is launching in two different configurations; a 12GB configuration and a 16GB one. Nvidia claims even the lower-end 12GB card can outperform the 3090 Ti when utilizing DLSS 3. The RTX 4080 16GB starts at $1199, while the 12GB version starts at $899. Both will launch sometime in November.\n\nTo show off Nvidia\u2019s fancy new cards and DLSS tech, a new version of Portal is coming out called Portal RTX. It\u2019ll be a free update for owners of the game on Steam in November, and will work on any RTX card, despite DLSS 3 being exclusive to the 4000 series GPUs. \n\nNvidia will also be releasing called RTX Remix, that allows modders to easily bring RTX enhancements like up-rezed textures and ray-tracing to older titles, Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind used as an example in the reveal showcase.\n\nIf you want to check out these new cards with a more recent release, Cyberpunk is getting a 4000 series makeover. DLSS 3 will allow for a new Overdrive ray-tracing mode, that\u2019ll make the regular, old boring ray-tracing mode on your stupid, crappy current RTX GPU look like you\u2019re playing the game in 1977, not 2077.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aHtO0QD888", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Kiriko Origin Story Trailer", "description": "Get to know more about Kiriko Kamori a ninja healer coming to Overwatch 2!\n\nLearn about how she forged her own path with a mix of tradition and innovation.\n\n#overwatch2 #kiriko #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6YgMMada2A", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Return To Monkey Island Review", "description": "The iconic point-and-click adventure series returns with a heartfelt and nostalgic adventure that any mighty pirate would be a fool to miss.\n\n#gaming #returntomonkeyisland #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4--LplBTNwI", "date_published": "2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
