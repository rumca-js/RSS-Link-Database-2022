Clicking the little arrow will expand the setting, letting you switch to another wifi network, change the power profile on your laptop, or even select the audio output and inputs.\n\nIn the apps grid, you now get some pagination arrows to let you move easily from one page to the other if you're not using a touchpad.\n\nThe File manager has also received a lot of love. First, it's now adaptive. The list view also makes it a lot easier to select multiple files and folders. There's also some blank space between elements so you can use the context menu inside the current directory, and it lets you drag the mouse to select multiple files.\n\nThe properties dialog has also been revamped, the recents folder can now be sorted, and the search UI saw a nice revamp as well, with a filter icon replacing the drop down arrow Nautilus used previously.\n\nYou can also middle click the next or previous button to open the resultant directory in a new tab, thumbnails with transparency will display a checkerboard background, you can copy the current path to the clipboard from the context menu, or open the current directory in other apps from the same menu, and the tabs have a new look.\n\nThe new Device Security page is accessible from the Privacy panel, and it gives you some details about the status of your hardware and firmware. All of this is combined into a security level ranging from 0 to 3, 3 being the highest, that will let you know whether your hardware is safe or not.\n\nThe Calendar is getting a new sidebar with a datepicker and an agenda view, and it's responsive. You also get a new pinch to zoom gesture to scale the main view.\n\nEpiphany now supports webextensions, so you can install Firefox and Chrome extensions inside it. All you have to do is download the xpi or crx file, and add them from Epiphany's \"Extensions\" menu. Epiphany also gets the \"view source\" option.\n\nGNOME software also got some love, with performance tweaks and improvements, and a better drop down to select the packaging format, now indicated by a big colored pill. You'll also be able to see other apps made by the same developer as the one you're currently looking at.\n\nIf you installed web apps using GNOME web, and if your distro has that support enabled, GNOME software can also manage web apps.\n\nGNOME contacts can now import and export vcard contacts, which is nice, because that's a pretty basic feature for a contacts app.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefK40cjz9s", "date_published": "2022-09-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
