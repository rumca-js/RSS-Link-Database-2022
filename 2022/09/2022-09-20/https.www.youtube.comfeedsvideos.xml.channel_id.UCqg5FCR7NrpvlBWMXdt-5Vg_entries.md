This week on Breakout we're discussing how lower-budget games have been doing quite well lately, reviving the "AA" market with tighter and more focused experiences. Even the AAA scene seems to be taking notice.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
