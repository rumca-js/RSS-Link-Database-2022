This episode was made in partnership with The Kavli Prize. The Kavli Prize honors scientists for breakthroughs in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience — transforming our understanding of the big, the small, and the complex.To learn more, go to https://www.kavliprize.org/prizes/neuroscience/2022
