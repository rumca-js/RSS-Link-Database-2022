Cyberpunk 2077 was met with overwhelming disappointment when it first released thanks to a mix of it being overhyped and over-buggy. But, it's back and more popular than it's been in over a year. Is it Patch 1.6? Is it Edgerunners?

Cyberpunk 2077 was met with overwhelming disappointment when it first released thanks to a mix of it being overhyped and over-buggy. But, it's back and more popular than it's been in over a year. Is it Patch 1.6? Is it Edgerunners?

CD Projekt Red has spent over a year patching Cyberpunk 2077, and recently, patch 1.6 released. Many game breaking bugs have been patched at this point, and especially for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. However, what seems to have relit the fire under Cyberpunk 2077 is Netlfix and Studio Trigger's recent anime: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.

Edgerunners was animated by Studio Trigger, the team famous for anime such as Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Promare. It was founded by the team who created Gurren Lagann. And, their animation is spectacular, once again showcased with Edgerunners.

Edgerunners has plenty of Easter eggs from Cyberpunk 2077, and draws deeply from its lore and world to create a story focused around Cyber Psychos. And - it's popularity and success has lead to a reawakening in the Cyberpunk 2077 community, with many players coming back to a game that is finally near the state it should have been at release.

So here's a rundown on the new-found popularity of Cyberpunk 2077, and how Edgerunners was able to breath life into the franchise.

## Overwatch 2 - Fantastic Update But Stumbles As A Sequel

Overwatch 2 improves upon the core gameplay and characters fans love, but loses some of its predecessor's spirit in the process. 

There are few moments of calm in Overwatch 2. The action is closer, louder, and faster, and the voice lines are quippier and happen more often. However, in that brief period between selecting your hero and the barriers opening, unleashing you and your teammates out onto the battlefield, there is a brief window of peace--a split-second for meditation.

It was during these moments, as I watched my beloved Hana Song (aka D.Va) shift her weight from one side of her mecha to the other before offering a sweet "annyeong" to a teammate, I forgot I was playing Overwatch 2--I forgot it was no longer 2016. In both my life and Overwatch, a lot has changed, but in these little moments it all felt as if nothing had, and it all felt a bit surreal.

## Stadia Refunds Explained | GameSpot News

On today’s GameSpot News ,Google Stadia is being shut down, players are being given refunds for purchases and PlayStation Stars reportedly includes customer service rewards. 
#GamingNews #Stadia #PS5 

Stadia was first revealed in early 2019 at that year's GDC event, and officially launched in November that year. The streaming service had an impressive number of third-party games available, with big names such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Cyberpunk 2077, and Doom Eternal in its library. Google also had big plans for exclusive titles on Stadia and began investing in its own game studios, but by February 2021, it had shut down that division and announced that it would no longer develop its own games.

Following the news of Stadia coming to an end, many users in possession of the service’s controller, took to places like reddit to ask Google for unlocked Bluetooth capabilities. This is something the community has been requesting for years, but now that the service is ending, it would go a long way to making sure the hardware does not become trash for many gamers. The good news is that the Stadia controller works for other platforms like Steam when used wired, so that will always be an option if Google doesn’t unlock wireless capabilities.

Meanwhile over on PlayStation, Sony is preparing to launch PlayStation Stars, a new loyalty program that anybody with a PlayStation account can join. It does not require a PlayStation Plus membership and will first debut in Asia today, September 29, North and South America on October 5, and Europe and Australia on October 13. PlayStation Stars works by rewarding players who complete campaigns and activities like a Monthly Check-in campaign--essentially just playing any game--or earning specific Trophies.

October’s free PlayStation Plus games have been officially revealed and the alleged GTA 6 hacker appeared in court. 
#GamingNews #PSPlus #GTA6 

PlayStation has announced the PS plus free games lineup for October 2022 and remember, all tiers of PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to claim these starting October 4. Hot Wheels Unleashed is an arcade racing game that was released last year to pretty solid reviews. Even though it's five years old at this point, Injustice 2 still looks and plays great. It features a ton of unique content, including a wonderfully made story mode and a boatload of challenges with unique rewards. The lineup is rounded out by Superhot, one of the best indie games in recent years. Superhot is a first-person shooter that plays like a puzzle game. 

Switching gears to GTA now. 

London police have arrested a 17-year-old suspected of perpetrating the recent hack on Rockstar Games, which resulted in the unprecedented leaking of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage. As reported by Eurogamer, the suspect entered a not-guilty plea related to computer misuse, but did plead guilty to violating bail conditions. The arrest, made on September 22, was announced by the City of London Police Twitter account the following day. In its initial post, the police department did not specify if the hacker, described as a "17-year-old in Oxfordshire," was suspected of hacking Rockstar Games. However, it did say it was "part of an investigation" made in collaboration with the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit.
