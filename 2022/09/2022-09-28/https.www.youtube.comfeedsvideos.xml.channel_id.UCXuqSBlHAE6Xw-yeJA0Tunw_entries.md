There are a ton of reasons why a person might want to own more than one PC, but a surprising lack of cases that support two systems at once- and that’s strange, because so many cases out there have a large amount of empty space. Even in an ITX build, we think there’s a better use for all that space: another PC!

Intel's 13th gen, Raptor lake, is finally here! The timing couldn't be worse with AMD's processors launching just yesterday, but the 13900K is nothing to sneeze at and if the price is right and the graphs don't lie, then AMD might have to reconsider the 7950X at $699.
