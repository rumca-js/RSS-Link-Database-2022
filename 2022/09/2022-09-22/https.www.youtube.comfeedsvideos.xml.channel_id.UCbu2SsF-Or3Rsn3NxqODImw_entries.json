The project is reminiscent of a fan-made GTA V map created by GTA Forum users, who used the game's promotional footage and screenshots to get an early view of Los Santos. This time, the bare-bones map is being created using in-game coordinates displayed in the leak to figure out where each location sits in relation to the rest of them. These cartographers have had to get creative in order to get around Rockstar's copyright restrictions, with much of the main GTA Forums discussion working out how to most accurately map the leaked content without including images that can't be posted in the community. Other projects hosted outside the forums have more complete maps in the works, including mini-map segments taken from the leaked footage. One map posted by Church of GTA includes some speculative roads and borders, as well as the more concrete details taken from the leaks.\n\nSwitching gears to Call of Duty now. Modern Warfare II's beta is in full swing, and one of the hot topics players are discussing is the lack of nameplates above enemies, with many calling for the feature to return in the name of improving visibility. In previous Call of Duty titles, enemy players would have their name displayed in red above their heads, making it clear they were not teammates but hostiles. That's not the case in the Modern Warfare II beta, where players have reported regularly shooting at their own teammates due to it being unclear who is and isn't an enemy.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYd15Xa86sI", "date_published": "2022-09-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hyper Demon is a Beautiful Nightmare Game | GameSpot After Dark Ep 163", "description": "This week the After Dark crew talks about a LOT of games such as Mario + Rabbids, Temtem, Return to Monkey Island, Trombone Champ, Hyper Demon, and the Modern Warfare II beta!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:01:12 - Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope\n0:07:22 - Halo 3\n0:09:19 - One Piece\n0:10:50 - Vampire Survivors \n0:11:29 - Temtem 1.0\n0:18:43 - Palworld (Pokemon with Guns)\n0:20:53 - Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection\n0:25:15 - Return to Monkey Island\n0:34:41 - Cyberpunk Edgerunners + Future of Cyberpunk\n0:44:43 - Trombone Champ\n0:50:34 - Hyper Demon\n0:57:42 - Call of Duty Modern Warfare II beta\n1:10:59 - Did a game get us into another hobby?\n1:15:29 - Yakitate!!

Most notably, Sparks of Hope outright transforms the flow of combat, dropping the grid-based movement and strict action economy of Kingdom Battle to incorporate a wider variety of meaningful choices that you can make for each character on their turn. It's a lot to keep track of and experiment with but, man, it all results in an incredibly fun game that I cannot wait to play in full. Every battle felt like an opportunity to switch things up and try something new in order to further refine how to get the most out of my movement and each character's unique skillset--even after the whole three hours I had, I still left the preview event thinking about how I hadn't gotten the chance to try absolutely every combination available. Sparks of Hope is definitely a game to look out for, coming to Switch on October 20. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Intro\n00:35 Story Breakdown\n01:00 Character Impressions\n01:49 Gameplay Breakdown\n05:19 Character Variety\n05:42 Outro\n\n#gaming #MarioRabbids #gamespot #ubisoft", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZZfZZ1jLjg", "date_published": "2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Slime Rancher 2 First 20 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Slime Rancher 2 continues the story of Beatrix LeBeau and the Far Far Range from the first game, only this time she'll be heading to a new area called Rainbow Island.

All on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nSpeaking with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is confident that the company's proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard will be approved by regulators. \n\nThe executive went on to point out that Microsoft is not the biggest player in gaming--he estimated that Microsoft is the No. 4 or No. 5 player in the space, with Sony being first. \"So if this is about competition, let us have competition,\" Nadella said.\n\nWhile this statement is true, acquiring Activision would likely make Microsoft the biggest games publisher, and on top of that, Microsoft as a whole is a much bigger company than Sony, with a market capitalization over twenty times the size.\n\nNadella's comments came after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority launched a more extensive investigation into the buyout. The CMA said it is \"concerned\" that Microsoft's proposal to buy Activision Blizzard could \"substantially lessen competition\" for sales of game consoles, subscription services, and cloud gaming networks.\n\nBut forget about PlayStation and Xbox. PC gaming is the only way to fly. You\u2019re above petty corporate squabbles. All you care about is Modern Warfare 2 PC specs, which dropped today, along with the open beta for the game on the platform\u2026 If you pre-ordered!\n\nThe minimum specs for the beta call for 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-3570 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X CPU, along with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon RX 470 card. The recommended specs, meanwhile, call for 16 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7-4770K or AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 580 card.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve built or bought a PC in the last 8-ish years, you should be in the clear.\n\nFine tuning your in-game settings has also never been easier. Modern Warfare 2 has added some great functionality, such as a customizable quick settings menu and a settings search bar.\n\nA full list of specs and features can be found on GameSpot dot com.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfBzzVLAvrM", "date_published": "2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What You Need To Know - Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II has made big changes to guns, movement, throwables, and perks. Let\u2019s give you the knowledge to slay in the open beta.\u00a0\n\nTimestamps: \n0:26 Movement Changes\n2:13 Perk Packages \n4:12 Gadgets & Nades\n8:32 Guns and Progression\n10:46 Quality of Life Changes\n12:10 3rd Person Mode\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II brings a lot of new changes to Call of Duty, and you can see them in the open beta. In this video, we\u2019re going to dive into what\u2019s new with movement, perks, gadgets and grenades, gun customization, third-person mode, and quality of life.\u00a0\n\nOverall, Infinity Ward has delivered fantastic map design with multiple lanes and climbing routes. To get through those spaces quickly, it\u2019s time for you to learn what you can and can\u2019t dolphin dive over and how wall-hanging and peeking works. Spoilers, you can even shoot over the top of walls while hanging.\u00a0\n\nPerks have had an overhaul and now come in packages, which means players don\u2019t have to choose between specialists and killstreaks the way they did in Modern Warfare 2019. We have a few recommended builds for you in order to self-revive and quickly regenerate lethal and tactical items.\u00a0\n\nIn the gadgets and grenades territory, it\u2019s time for you to learn how to use drill charges, which can go through floors, ceilings, and walls. We\u2019ll have a look at shock sticks and their uses to build space and prevent enemies from pushing you. We\u2019ll also have a look at seemingly Rainbow Six Siege-inspired gadgets like cameras and mobile barricades. Then we\u2019ll mess around with the hilarious and maybe not very useful decoy dummy, which still has a few surprises you might not know about.\u00a0\n\nGuns and progression have been revamped for better or worse and the Gunsmith menu now sees players unlocking categories of attachments and guns with the ability to swap out receivers and make Franken-guns. Although this system allows for more variety and less time spent unlocking attachments for every gun, it also comes with confusing menus, so we\u2019ll explain how it works. For example, you might need to grind kills with a battle rifle to get a submachine gun. We can also show you how to cheese standard loadout classes to unlock the Lachmann-556 until that gets patched.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll have a look at new quality-of-life changes, like an FOV slider on base consoles, as well as varied and fantastic attention to detail on character animations. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta runs September 22-23 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC for players who pre-order the game,\u00a0 and then for everyone September 24-26. The open beta period should finally include Battle Maps with modes such as Ground War. Modern Warfare 2 releases on October 28, with Warzone 2.0 releasing on November 16.\n\n#modernwarfare2 #cod #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=breX7JbsNnE", "date_published": "2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
