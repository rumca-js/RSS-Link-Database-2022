Thanks to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and their research and technology partner MBARI for partnering with us on this episode of SciShow. They worked together on an exhibition, “Into The Deep: Exploring Our Undiscovered Ocean,” to give visitors to the Aquarium a rare look at some of the animals that thrive in the least-explored area of the planet, the deep sea! Head to https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/into-the-deep to learn more or follow them on their social media. 

As far as slugs go, sea angels are pretty adorable. But they’re also pretty ferocious predators, in an evolutionary race with their prey, the sea butterfly.
