Top Gun Maverick brings back Tom Cruise as Maverick to once more fly fighter jets in a visual marvel. The movie became the biggest box office success of the year, even more so than the MCU, and everybody seemed to like it. Which is crazy because this movie is missing a proper villain. Somehow it just manages to make things work without one. So in today's Film Perfection let's try to figure out what you can do when the villain is missing. Not to say you shouldn't include a villain, because unless you're Christopher McQuarrie it might go badly wrong, but more so what you can do on top of your villain.
