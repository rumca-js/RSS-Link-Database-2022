Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of \"En El Olvido,\" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. \n\nIn the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancol\u00eda as the band slips into the easy R&B number \"Evergreen.\"  \"We're about to get more sad,\" he says to the crowd with a grin. \n\nDespite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert \u2014 an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through \"Evergreen\" and \"Petrified\" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat \"Endlessly.\"  El coraz\u00f3n puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. \n\nAs Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: \"I want y'all to think about something,\u201d he says. \u201cI want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge.\" He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m playing!\u201d But as his and the band\u2019s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there\u2019s only room for building each other up. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cEn El Olvido\u201d\n\u201cEvergreen\u201d\n\u201cPetrified\u201d\n\u201cEndlessly\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Apollo: vocals\nJonah Feingold: guitar\nJackson Shanks: drums\nManny Barajas: bass\nHarrison Hawkins: keys, music director\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\nBrian Antonio Gazo Martinez: vocals\nFabian Anthony Chavez: saxophone\nMarcus Clayton Paul: trumpet\nSilvia Estrada: guitarr\u00f3n\nMayra Mart\u00ednez: guitarr\u00f3n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAnimator: Alant\u00e9 Serene\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Pierre Kattar\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #ElTiny #OmarApollo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p78XATPcyg", "date_published": "2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Allison Russell: Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Ann Powers: September 14, 2022 \n\u201cI am grateful and I am proud for this circle of goddesses,\u201d said Allison Russell during her joyful, rousing Tiny Desk set, reaching toward the six women surrounding her. Russell has cultivated this band\u2019s harmoniousness in the year she\u2019s been touring in support of her astounding, unclassifiable album Outside Child, which tells the singer\u2019s life story, from her childhood escaping abuse through an itinerant adolescence and young adulthood anchored, finally, by the love and community she\u2019s found as a feminist and a music-maker. This group \u2014 three string players, two guitarists, a drummer and Russell on her banjo and clarinet \u2014 embodies healing community, and its interplay and gospelized group vocals turbo-charged every song.\n \nRussell, who burned a little palo santo wood and placed portraits of Prince and Joni Mitchell nearby as talismans before performing, began her set by invoking the ancestors with \u201cQuasheba.\u201d She continued with the incantatory \u201c4th Day Prayer,\u201d a spell cast to undo the oppression of childhood trauma. The intense interplay of cellists Larissa Maestro and Monique Ross and violinist Chauntee Ross undergirded the propulsive arrangement. The blues-rooted \u201cNightflyer\u201d followed; drummer Megan Coleman\u2019s green satin angel-wing sleeves shimmered as she marked a beat that guitarists Joy Clark and Mandy Fer intensified. Then came \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone,\u201d a song Russell originally wrote as part of the Americana supergroup Our Native Daughters, just rereleased as a duet with Brandi Carlile. \u201cLa musique nous r\u00e9unit / Une famille,\u201d Russell sang in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French. \u201cA family,\u201d she repeated.
