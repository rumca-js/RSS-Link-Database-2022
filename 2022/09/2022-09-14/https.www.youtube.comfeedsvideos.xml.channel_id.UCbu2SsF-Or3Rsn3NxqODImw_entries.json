Fortunately they got a big plate of food at today\u2019s Call of Duty Next event that included a reveal of the game\u2019s map, how it differs from the original Warzone and launch details.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s start with the new location. Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0's map is called Al Mazrah, and it takes place in the desert of a fictional region of Western Asia. Some of the points of interest include: Quarry, Airport, Taraq Village and Al Mazrah City just to name a few. This new map features a river that runs through the middle, offering seasoned Warzone players a new way to traverse a Call of Duty BR.\u00a0\n\nNew ways to move around the map will really come in handy when the circle starts to close or better yet, when the circles start to close.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWarzone 2.0 will have a brand-new circle mechanic for Al Mazrah, with multiple circles appearing and changing end-game scenarios when they eventually combine into one again.\u00a0\n\nWhen you happen to fall victim to the gas or an enemy player, you\u2019ll be greeted with the game\u2019s revamped \"Gulag 2.0,\" where players must battle it out via 2v2 instead of the normal 1v1 arena. This new second chance Gulag will include the need to loot for weapons, deal with something called \"The Jailer,\" and more.\n\nAl Mazrah will also feature areas that are controlled by an AI faction; these sections are called Strongholds. The developer says this addition of AI is meant to add higher stakes and more realistic combat scenarios to the Warzone experience.\u00a0\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:19 - Map\n01:57 - DMZ\n02:13 - Raids\n02:42 - Anti-Cheat", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlZR_i7bQZs", "date_published": "2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "COD: Modern Warfare II Invasion, Prisoner Breakout, and More Modes Overview | COD Next Showcase 2022", "description": "A brand new mode called Invasion is coming to CoD: MWII.

We first get Kratos and Atreus standing next to two large wolves staring up at an eclipse.\n\nI do want to point out, without proper eye protection. Remember, these are ancient gods, so don\u2019t try this at home.\n\nSpoilers for God of War 2018, Atreus, who was revealed to be Loki at the end of the game, then shoots an arrow at the Moon, one of the wolves chasing it as it begins to move across the sky, tearing it as it goes. This likely indicates that the two wolves are Sk\u00f6ll and Hati, the sons of the wolf Fenrir, whom himself is the son of Loki.\n\nReally interested to see how they explain that in this game.\n\nIn the Norse myth, Sk\u00f6ll and Hati are fated to chase the Sun and the Moon, to then catch them in Ragnarok, plunging the world into darkness, so what we\u2019re seeing in this trailer is potentially our first glimpse of the game\u2019s take on the titular event.\n\nThe final shot of the trailer is then Kratos squaring off against Thor, as the former tosses the Leviathan Axe and the latter throws the hammer Mjolnir, the two colliding before their masters pull them back with magic toward their hands.\n\nMetal.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:12 - God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n02:04 - PSVR2\n02:48 - Like a Dragon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODWt-ofaa-A", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "ID@Xbox Fall Showcase Livestream", "description": "Tune in for another ID@Xbox showcase, featuring updates and new announcements from indie games coming to Xbox, including Metal: Hellsinger, You Suck at Parking, and Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed.\r\n\r\n#xbox #gaming #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3L8TJDGhGA", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PSVR2's Small Iterations Make For Impressive Changes", "description": "PlayStation VR 2 makes the most of the PS5, and Horizon Call of the Mountain is an excellent showcase of what the new headset will be able to do.\u00a0Learn more about Tamoor Hussain's experience in this latest hands on preview for the PlayStation VR 2 and Horizon Call of the Mountain.\n\n#psvr2 #playstation #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-dFKRiwbxw", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Things You Might Have Missed", "description": "Max Blumenthal combs over the latest trailer from BOTW sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. From where these locations are referencing to how the name connects to the game, we breakdown what we might be looking forward to in the follow up game.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 finally dropped its official name, Tears of the Kingdom will be released May 12th of 2023. We\u2019ll take a quick look at what we saw and put some more insight into things you might have missed during the trailer. \n\nWe open up to multiple scenes with multiple stone carvings. I won\u2019t pretend to know everything about Zelda lore and history, but what I do know is that surface level connections can be made immediately to this creature and its Zonai origins, with these common designs seen over and over again, and another part we\u2019ll see in another scene.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe then see an incoming army with malice of the new long horned Bokoblins and Moblins defeating either Hylians or some other tribe we don't know yet. They obviously look human but this could be anything from Hylians, to Sheikah, to some Zonai tribe we haven\u2019t seen yet. We will likely know in the future. Another thing I\u2019d like to point out is that EVERY trailer so far has had some Ghibli reference thrown in again, this time from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, where tapestries of an age long past were shown with somber piano music. We have shown this proof from Castle in the Sky with the floating land masses with roots growing through them, to how malice interacts with Link\u2019s arm to Princess Mononoke, and more, and it\u2019s cool that they\u2019re keeping up with this motif.\n\n#thelegendofzelda #tearsofthekingdom #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zURG4RWnpjk", "date_published": "2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
