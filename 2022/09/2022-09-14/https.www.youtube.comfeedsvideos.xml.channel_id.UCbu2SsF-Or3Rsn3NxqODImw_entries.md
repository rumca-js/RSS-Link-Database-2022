## COD Warzone 2.0 New Gulag & Map Explained | GameSpot News

Call of Duty: Warzone fans have been hungry for more information about the game’s sequel Warzone 2.0. Fortunately they got a big plate of food at today’s Call of Duty Next event that included a reveal of the game’s map, how it differs from the original Warzone and launch details. 

Let’s start with the new location. Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0's map is called Al Mazrah, and it takes place in the desert of a fictional region of Western Asia. Some of the points of interest include: Quarry, Airport, Taraq Village and Al Mazrah City just to name a few. This new map features a river that runs through the middle, offering seasoned Warzone players a new way to traverse a Call of Duty BR. 

New ways to move around the map will really come in handy when the circle starts to close or better yet, when the circles start to close.  

Warzone 2.0 will have a brand-new circle mechanic for Al Mazrah, with multiple circles appearing and changing end-game scenarios when they eventually combine into one again. 

When you happen to fall victim to the gas or an enemy player, you’ll be greeted with the game’s revamped "Gulag 2.0," where players must battle it out via 2v2 instead of the normal 1v1 arena. This new second chance Gulag will include the need to loot for weapons, deal with something called "The Jailer," and more.

Al Mazrah will also feature areas that are controlled by an AI faction; these sections are called Strongholds. The developer says this addition of AI is meant to add higher stakes and more realistic combat scenarios to the Warzone experience.

The annual NBA 2K installment is back with NBA 2K23, this time featuring Devin Booker on the standard cover, and NBA superstar Michael Jordan on the "Michael Jordan Edition" and "Championship Edition" covers. 
#nba2k23 #gamespot #nba2k 

Fan favorite feature MyPlayer returns to NBA 2K23 featuring a storyline of your player getting drafted to an NBA team of your choice, but being boo'd by team fans as they were hoping your college rival, Shep Owens, would be drafted over you.

Meanwhile, the game contains a blast from the past with MyNBA mode, which allows you to start your NBA career not only in modern times, but during classic eras in NBA history. From Larry vs. Bird, to the Jordan Era, to the Kobe Era. And that's not the last of Michael Jordan in NBA 2K23. NBA 2K11's The Jordan Challenge returns, this time completely revamped and with not just 10 classic Jordan games, but 15 classic games for you to play and relive, right along with interviews from major sports figures who were right alongside the action.

While most of the game boasts major improvements, including in the way the game has tackled giving power back to strong finishers and slashers, modeling this after the play of Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, invasive microtransactions are still a major hurdle to overcome. The game's MyTeam mode is just as bad as comparable modes like Ultime Team in EA Sports games. It's essentially pay-to-win. Meanwhile, the game's MTX continue to dampen The City, with this Virtual Currency meaning you can dramatically improve your MyPlayer protagonist who can then use this player in PvP.

Make sure to watch the full review for all of Mark Delaney's thoughts on NBA 2k23, and stay tuned to GameSpot for all things gaming.

## God of War Ragnarok Gets A Story Trailer, DualSense Controller | GameSpot News

A new trailer and controller for God of War Ragnarök, hands-on with PSVR2 and a bunch of new Yakuza/Like a Dragon games.
#Gaming #GodOfWarRagnarok #PSVR2 

The first limited edition DualSense controller, our first hands-on with PSVR 2, and more Yakuza games than you can shake a stick at. All this on today’s GameSpot News. 

Alongside a new trailer for God of War: Ragnarok during PlayStations recent State of Play also came the reveal of a branded DualSense controller. Featuring an icy white and blue style inspired by Midgard along with images of a bear (Kratos) and a wolf (Atreus).

The story trailer itself gives us our best look yet at the plot of the game. We get an extensive narration from Tyr, the Norse God of War, who crosses paths with Kratos and questions his Greek counterpart’s motivations. The trailer shows of an extensive breadth of different locales, as well as a bevy of new enemies, the developer having explained previously to Game Informer that the studio was focused on an increased variety of foes.

The trailer ends with two incredible moments. We first get Kratos and Atreus standing next to two large wolves staring up at an eclipse.

I do want to point out, without proper eye protection. Remember, these are ancient gods, so don’t try this at home.

Spoilers for God of War 2018, Atreus, who was revealed to be Loki at the end of the game, then shoots an arrow at the Moon, one of the wolves chasing it as it begins to move across the sky, tearing it as it goes. This likely indicates that the two wolves are Sköll and Hati, the sons of the wolf Fenrir, whom himself is the son of Loki.

Really interested to see how they explain that in this game.

In the Norse myth, Sköll and Hati are fated to chase the Sun and the Moon, to then catch them in Ragnarok, plunging the world into darkness, so what we’re seeing in this trailer is potentially our first glimpse of the game’s take on the titular event.

The final shot of the trailer is then Kratos squaring off against Thor, as the former tosses the Leviathan Axe and the latter throws the hammer Mjolnir, the two colliding before their masters pull them back with magic toward their hands.

Metal.

Max Blumenthal combs over the latest trailer from BOTW sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. From where these locations are referencing to how the name connects to the game, we breakdown what we might be looking forward to in the follow up game.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 finally dropped its official name, Tears of the Kingdom will be released May 12th of 2023. We’ll take a quick look at what we saw and put some more insight into things you might have missed during the trailer. 

We open up to multiple scenes with multiple stone carvings. I won’t pretend to know everything about Zelda lore and history, but what I do know is that surface level connections can be made immediately to this creature and its Zonai origins, with these common designs seen over and over again, and another part we’ll see in another scene.  

We then see an incoming army with malice of the new long horned Bokoblins and Moblins defeating either Hylians or some other tribe we don't know yet. They obviously look human but this could be anything from Hylians, to Sheikah, to some Zonai tribe we haven’t seen yet. We will likely know in the future. Another thing I’d like to point out is that EVERY trailer so far has had some Ghibli reference thrown in again, this time from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, where tapestries of an age long past were shown with somber piano music. We have shown this proof from Castle in the Sky with the floating land masses with roots growing through them, to how malice interacts with Link’s arm to Princess Mononoke, and more, and it’s cool that they’re keeping up with this motif.
