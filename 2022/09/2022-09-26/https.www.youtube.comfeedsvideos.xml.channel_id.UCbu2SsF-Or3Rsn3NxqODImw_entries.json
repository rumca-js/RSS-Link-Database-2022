The series is a cultural touchstone that has become a pillar in the shooter genre. So in honor of the 15th anniversary of Halo 3 this month, I wanted to focus on one of the most influential shooters of all time.\u00a0These are ten things you never knew about Halo 3.\n#gaming #Halo #gamespot #Bungie \n\nStu here to break down the hidden secrets and fun facts about Halo 3. Halo, especially the Bungie-made entries, are regarded as some of the most prestigious shooters in video games. They tell a compelling and highly praised story and offer a plethora of multiplayer options that are bar none in the industry. I love that the devs were able to add some ridiculous secrets and easter eggs in Halo 3. Now all I want to do is get in some crazy gravity hammer battles on Narrows.\n\nCREDITS: \nStuart Kimball: Writer / Host / Producer\n\nSTAMPS:\n00:00 Intro\n00:18 Here Kitty Kitty!\n00:58 Bomb Voyage\n01:31 Missing Link\n02:23 Jason Jones\n03:21 Hippos?

In the first half of Overwatch 2's First Time User Experience, they'll unlock all the modes. In the second half, players will progressively obtain original Overwatch heroes. It will take 100 matches to unlock the full original roster.\n\nThe game\u2019s 1.03 patch will increase the amount of experience needed to level up a single character between levels 3 and 15, as the developers found that \"players could get to level 15 of the mastery track too quickly.\" MultiVersus fans reacted to the change over on the game\u2019s subreddit with memes and long threads about whether or not this is a positive change. One of the suggestions a handful of users think would help the experience is the addition of more rewards after level 15. Another user suggested making a character\u2019s gameplay related perks complete at level 10 and make everything above 10 cosmetic or currency.\u00a0\n\nFull Patch Notes:\u00a0\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-1-03-patch-adds-rick-sanchez-makes-shaggy-free-for-all-new-players/1100-6507834/\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Overwatch 2\n02:13 - MultiVersus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3HZu8qS6UQ", "date_published": "2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Overwatch 2 launches October 4!\n\nPrepare yourselves for a  one-of-a-kind, action-packed, free-to-play experience with new maps, new modes, and new heroes.\n\n#overwatch2 #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53c0mcwJd6Q", "date_published": "2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Dev Reacts To Game\u2019s Popularity | GameSpot News", "description": "One of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s developers has reacted to the game\u2019s rise in popularity and a solid date for E3 2023 has been officially announced.\n#GamingNews #Cyberpunk2077 #Witcher3 \n\nCyberpunk 2077's initial launch period was highlighted by game-breaking bugs and massive performance issues across last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles at the time.
