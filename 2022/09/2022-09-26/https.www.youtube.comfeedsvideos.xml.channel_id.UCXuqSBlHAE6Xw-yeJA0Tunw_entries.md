At long last, AMD has launched their new Zen 4 CPUs, Ryzen 7950X, 7900X, 7700X, and 7600X, and they look great. Alongside the enhancements of socket AM5, these new chips look like they give Intel a run for their money... or do they? AMD has a bit of an issue of not being better than their best gaming chip, or better value than Intel's platform which makes some of these chips hard to recommend. And with Intel's Raptor Lake looming on the horizon, AMD's future might not look so bright anymore.
