Let\u2019s see where Battlefield 2042 could be in its redemption story.\u00a0\n#gaming #gamename #gamespot #battlefield #bf2042 #2042 #specialists #DICE #redemption #season2 #stranded #newmap #exodus #conquest #battlefieldportal \n\nRedemption in Video Games has sadly become a more common story in the modern era with live-service models allowing unfinished games to ship broken or with questionable business practices. But with that model also comes patches, and support for games post-launch that can eventually get games into a state where we no longer regret having spent our money. With enough time and support, like No Man\u2019s Sky, Diablo 3, Destiny, and countless others did eventually turn it around.\u00a0\n\nFor Battlefield 2042 to redeem itself, it needs to embrace its positives and double down on them while cutting its losses on things that are too far gone to completely rework within a reasonable time. Before all of that, a clean-up phase is necessary to tackle bugs, and some soul-searching is needed to see just what the identity of Battlefield 2042 should be. Does it strive to reach its original ambitions, or does it chart a new path with a potentially new audience. Be sure to drop a like and pop into the comments if there are other games you think have a shot at redemption, or if you\u2019re interested in hearing about the redemption stories of other games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVyyO7zqE1E", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Disney & Marvel Games Showcase Livestream", "description": "Tune in to the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE for announcements, trailers, and reveals for new and upcoming games from Marvel Games, Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studio.\r\n\r\n#gaming #marvel #disney", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R25VBJemceY", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Disney & Marvel Showcase Full Presentation", "description": "Check out the full presentation for the Disney & Marvel showcase.

All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nWith more information about the standalone Warzone 2 on the horizon as part of the upcoming Call of Duty Next, some fans have wondered what exactly will be happening with the original version of Warzone. Reporter Tom Henderson on Twitter claims the game will be undergoing a name change on November 28, and that \"it looks like original Warzone will continue to receive updates/DLC.\"\n\nIt seems the original Warzone going forward will focus primarily on the Caldera map set in the Pacific, which was introduced as part of what Activision Blizzard called \"Warzone Pacific\" alongside Call of Duty: Vanguard Season 1 in November 2021.\n\nLike its predecessor, Warzone 2 will be launching some time after the October 25 release Modern Warfare 2, and will feature many of that game's mechanics, vehicles, and weapons.\n\nHaving Warzone and Warzone 2 coexist does line up with what Activision has said previously about the two battle royales, namely that Warzone will \"continue on as a separate experience that will include a continuation of player progression and inventories within that Warzone experience.\" That means skins, weapons, and unlocks in the original Warzone will not carry over to Warzone 2.\n\nLooking further into the future for Call of Duty, 2024's installment might tell a story about the war in Iraq. Twitter user TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty details in the past, said the campaign for 2024's Call of Duty game will cover what the US government calls Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place years earlier during the Gulf War of the nineties, the event later adapted and dramatized in 2001's Black Hawk Down.\n\nTheGhostOfHope said it will be Raven Software developing the campaign for Call of Duty 2024. Raven also developed the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.\n\nIf Call of Duty 2024 is indeed about the Iraq war, the game will likely be contentious. Around 200,000 civilians died as a result of the war, and another game, Six Days in Fallujah, has generated a good amount of debate and discussion for its themes and elements. One could only imagine that the size and popularity of a franchise like Call of Duty addressing those horrific, real life events would result in an even larger discourse.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:13 - Warzone \n01:21 - Call of Duty 2024\n02:24 - Overwatch 2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJlsvDZkez0", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Splatoon 3 is Familiar But Great! | GameSpot After Dark Ep 161", "description": "This week the crew talks Splatoon 3, our hands-on with A Plague Tale: Requiem, and The Rings of Power show.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:03:01 - A Plague Tale: Requiem\n0:21:28 - Splatoon 3\n0:40:25 - Streets of Rage 4 Mobile\n0:41:41 - Swipe Mobile Showcase\n0:48:14 - House of the Dragon & The Rings of Power\n1:08:51 - Jojo Stone Ocean\n1:13:24 - Dark\n1:14:44 - Question of the Week\n1:32:38 - Outro\n\n#gaming #splatoon3 #plaguetale", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0cZd9vNbg", "date_published": "2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Untitled Black Panther and Captain America Game Reveal Trailer | Disney & Marvel Games Showcase", "description": "From Marvel and Skydance New Media comes this take on Hydra, Captain America, and Black Panther.

PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has responded to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying his company would go above and beyond industry standards and keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for years to come if the Xbox company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard goes through. \n\nRyan told GI.biz that Microsoft offered to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for specifically three years after the existing deal between Activision and Sony finishes. Ryan said this was \"inadequate on many levels.\"\n\n\"Microsoft has only offered for Call of Duty to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends,\" Ryan said. \"After almost 20 years of Call of Duty on PlayStation, their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take account of the impact on our gamers. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality Call of Duty experience, and Microsoft's proposal undermines this principle.\"\n\nWe don't know, however, what the duration of the previously agreed-upon deal between Sony and Activision for Call of Duty was. But whatever that is, it'll be extended by three years, apparently, but what happens after that is unclear. Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard is currently being reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world. New Zealand will be among the next countries to weigh in, with a decision due by September 9.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, the company is looking to give the Xbox UI a makeover, with a number of changes planned that will roll out as experiments for Xbox Insiders over the next few months.\n\nA key new feature is a planned \"jump back in\" row, which is designed to give players quick access to their most-recently-played games and apps. System apps like Settings, Store, Search and My Games & Apps will be easier to access as they will have their own tiles on Xbox Home. Microsoft notes that the rollout will be slow to start, and that Xbox will be iterating throughout the process, but a full launch of the new UI is planned for sometime in 2023. \n\nWhile Xbox and PlayStation bicker over Call of Duty, Battlefield has been making some moves. Marcus Lehto, who designed Master Chief and co-created the Halo universe, is heading up a brand-new Battlefield studio in Seattle. Electronic Arts announced that the studio is called Ridgeline Games, and it will develop a \"narrative campaign\" for Battlefield. Very little is known right now, but EA said this campaign will \"engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.\"\n\nAnother big announcement was that Battlefield creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has worked on the Battlefield series since it started in 2002, is departing the team. \nDespite hiccups at launch, the series\u2019 latest entry Battlefield 2042 was the fifth best-selling game of 2021 in the US. With these announcements, EA reiterated that it wants fans to know that EA is \"all-in on Battlefield.\" The company has DICE continuing to work on Battlefield's \"multiplayer suite,\" EA said, while another studio Ripple Effect will create an \"entirely new Battlefield experience that will complement and build upon the series' foundations.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5NCZPboZY", "date_published": "2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Division Resurgence: What\u2019s Coming To The Mobile Game | Swipe Mobile Showcase", "description": "Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence is a mobile MMO that brings open-world exploration and shooting to your pocket.\u00a0\n#gaming #thedivision #gamespot \n\nWe got a chance to speak to Fabrice Navrez, executive producer on The Division Resurgence, about how the game will bring the same Division experience to your mobile game.\n\nThe Division Resurgence will open with a scene set before the events of the first game, but then transition to its main storyline, which sits between the first and second game on the timeline.
