## Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats - live at Rock the Garden 2022
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plI7_yJZRLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plI7_yJZRLo)

“It’s been a couple years,” Nathaniel Rateliff observed from the stage, gazing out at the fan-filled hillside at Rock the Garden. “We’ve missed you all. We love you guys. It’s so good to be back.” 

Rateliff hadn’t been in Minnesota since March 2020, when he was touring in support of his solo album from that year, And It’s Still Alright. Now back onstage with his full band The Night Sweats, Rateliff and company rolled out a passionate set of songs from all three of their albums, including their latest release, The Future. In the lead-in to “A Little Honey,” Rateliff was proud to remind the audience that that song’s video was filmed on location at the Turf Club in St. Paul.

In a notable change from earlier performances, Rateliff appeared hatless — a symbol, intended or not, of opening up his whole self to the audience, and they responded in kind. The evening proved a catharsis as the band and audience engaged in a dialogue they hadn’t enjoyed in more than two years: the band giving their all — including keyboardist and bandleader Mark Shusterman appearing to direct both band and audience — as the audience bobbed their heads, danced, clapped and thrust their hands in the air in a glorious reunion that included several instances of call and response. Later on, Rateliff repeated his earlier sentiment, telling the crowd between songs, “We thank you for all your years of support. We love you guys so much.”

Perhaps in one of the set’s most poignant moments, Rateliff held a microphone in his hands, standing at the lip of the stage, ostensibly singing to each and every person in the audience: “Just remember, I’m on your side.”

And there was no doubt the feeling was mutual.
