At long last, the 6.1\u201d iPhone 14 gained a bigger sibling, the 6.7\u201d iPhone 14 Plus. Leaks surrounding the pro phones were validated, but only from a hardware standpoint. The software\u2014as many postulated\u2014was a far cry from a simple \u201cdot-and-pill\u201d that had been rumored. The \u201cdynamic island\u201d (l-o-frickin\u2019-l) cleverly places UI elements around the floating \u201cnotch\u201d with amazingly elastic animations to boot. The Watch Series 8 had a fairly boring year, but some women may benefit from improved ovulation tracking for better family planning. The Apple Watch SE 2 brought a new processor and lower price to the entry-level model, and the titanium Series Watch disappeared in favor of the new Apple Watch Ultra. The Watch Ultra packs a bunch of adventure-focused hardware and software features like a dive sensor, siren, dual speakers, three microphone array, a larger 49mm display wrapped in sapphire, a huge crown with surrounding crown guard, a new Action Button, and a whole lot more. We\u2019ll talk about everything\u2014from crash detection, to dive features, to the new health sensor, and more. Concerning the iPhone, we\u2019ll talk about our happy surprises and cautious\u2026 optimism? Don\u2019t miss this one! Oh, and let us take a bit of a victory lap concerning the AirPods Pro 2 rumors we were skeptical of!\n\nFollow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/snazzyq\nFollow me on Instagram - http://instagram.com/snazzyq\n\n00:00 GoOd mOrNInG!!!\n00:20 Apple Watch Series 8\n00:34 Temperature Sensor\n1:20 Health Data Encryption\n1:38 BUMPER CARS!\n2:05 Buy Apple Watch\u2014or DIE!\n2:30 Compass Backtrack\n3:20 Apple Watch SE\n4:10 Watch Ultra\n4:45 How Frickin' Big Is It?\n5:58 External Design and Hardware\n7:46 Inside Bits\n8:42 Compass Backtrack pt. 2\n9:23 Dive Computer Functionality\n10:20 Let's Talk Price...\n11:28 AirPods Pro 2\n13:35 AirPods 3 \"Update\"\n13:51 iPhone 14/14 Plus\n14:37 New Cameras & Action Mode\n15:34 eSIM (U.S. Only)\n16:32 Satellite Connectivity\n18:04 iPhone 14 Pro/14 Pro Max\n18:27 Dynamic Island\n19:51 Display Improvements\n21:17 New Camera System\n24:23 A16\n25:51 NRBs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-YPMBX29dA", "date_published": "2022-09-08 14:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
