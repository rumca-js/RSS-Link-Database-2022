We love you guys. It\u2019s so good to be back.\u201d \n\nRateliff hadn\u2019t been in Minnesota since March 2020, when he was touring in support of his solo album from that year, And It\u2019s Still Alright. Now back onstage with his full band The Night Sweats, Rateliff and company rolled out a passionate set of songs from all three of their albums, including their latest release, The Future. In the lead-in to \u201cA Little Honey,\u201d Rateliff was proud to remind the audience that that song\u2019s video was filmed on location at the Turf Club in St. Paul.\n\nIn a notable change from earlier performances, Rateliff appeared hatless \u2014 a symbol, intended or not, of opening up his whole self to the audience, and they responded in kind. The evening proved a catharsis as the band and audience engaged in a dialogue they hadn\u2019t enjoyed in more than two years: the band giving their all \u2014 including keyboardist and bandleader Mark Shusterman appearing to direct both band and audience \u2014 as the audience bobbed their heads, danced, clapped and thrust their hands in the air in a glorious reunion that included several instances of call and response. Later on, Rateliff repeated his earlier sentiment, telling the crowd between songs, \u201cWe thank you for all your years of support. We love you guys so much.\u201d\n\nPerhaps in one of the set\u2019s most poignant moments, Rateliff held a microphone in his hands, standing at the lip of the stage, ostensibly singing to each and every person in the audience: \u201cJust remember, I\u2019m on your side.\u201d\n\nAnd there was no doubt the feeling was mutual. \n\nSet List\n00:00:07 The Future\n00:03:40 I\u2019ve Been Failing You\n00:08:17 Look It Here\n00:11:26 I\u2019m On Your Side\n00:14:42 You Worry Me\n00:18:12 Baby I\u2019ve Lost My Way\n00:21:14 So Put Out\n00:25:02 A Little Honey\n00:28:06 Love Me Till I\u2019m Gone\n00:32:14 Face Down\n00:36:58 Oh, I\n00:40:31 Hey Mama\n00:44:22 Survivor\n00:48:17 Coolin\u2019 Out\n00:52:04 Band Intro\n00:56:34 I Need Never Get Old\n01:00:57 Out on the Weekend\n01:04:55 S.O.B.\n01:10:35 Love Don\u2019t\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
