## A Plague Tale: Requiem Feels Very Familiar

A Plague Tale: Requiem's story and characters have a lot of potential, but the gameplay feels a bit lacking so far.

Requiem takes place shortly after the first game and is set in 14th century France during the Bubonic Plague, at the outset of the Hundred Years' War. Although both games are set in a realistic depiction of France, the story often flirts with gothic supernatural elements. This is easily one of the coolest things about Innocence and Requiem, and what sets it apart from most third-person adventure games. The world is so wonderfully detailed and everything has a macabre sheen to it.

A Plague Tale: Requiem comes to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X on October 13. Be sure to keep an eye out for our review in the coming weeks.

## Battlefield 2042 - What Does Redemption Look Like?

Battlefield 2042 is looking for redemption starting with new maps and guns and eventually getting to a specialist rework. Let’s see where Battlefield 2042 could be in its redemption story. 
#gaming #gamename #gamespot #battlefield #bf2042 #2042 #specialists #DICE #redemption #season2 #stranded #newmap #exodus #conquest #battlefieldportal 

Redemption in Video Games has sadly become a more common story in the modern era with live-service models allowing unfinished games to ship broken or with questionable business practices. But with that model also comes patches, and support for games post-launch that can eventually get games into a state where we no longer regret having spent our money. With enough time and support, like No Man’s Sky, Diablo 3, Destiny, and countless others did eventually turn it around. 

For Battlefield 2042 to redeem itself, it needs to embrace its positives and double down on them while cutting its losses on things that are too far gone to completely rework within a reasonable time. Before all of that, a clean-up phase is necessary to tackle bugs, and some soul-searching is needed to see just what the identity of Battlefield 2042 should be. Does it strive to reach its original ambitions, or does it chart a new path with a potentially new audience. Be sure to drop a like and pop into the comments if there are other games you think have a shot at redemption, or if you’re interested in hearing about the redemption stories of other games.

Mobile games are a prominent market in the video game space, filled with millions upon million of players, but Kurt Indovina isn't one of them. However, that's about to change.
#gaming #gamespot #mobilegaming  

In an effort to learn about the vast mobile game market, Kurt locked his consoles up (to eliminate all temptations to play the games he knows and loves) and forced himself to only play mobile games for a week. 

For seven days, Kurt went without his Xbox Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and 3DS, and relied on his iPhone as his sole game console. With no context where to start, he threw himself in the deep end in an attempt to understand the appeal of mobile games, and, quite possibly, find his next favorite game. 

Kurt was familiar with the big games like PUBG, Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, and Diablo Immortal, but he was on a mission to find hidden gems; the games that take advantage of the phone in creative and unconventional ways. And, to his surprise, he found more than just a few games he loved, but formed an entirely new perspective on mobile gaming.

Games featured in the video (and Kurt's personal recommendations):
Florence
Bury Me My Love
Device 6
Songs of Bloom

## Massive Call of Duty And Warzone Leaks Before Next Showcase | GameSpot News

Warzone is sticking around after the release of Warzone 2, Call of Duty 2024 reportedly has its setting, and Overwatch 2 backlash over battle pass.
#GameSpot #CallOfDuty #Warzone #Overwatch2 

Leaked details on Call of Duty’s future ahead of the franchise’s upcoming Next event, plus uncertainty of Overwatch 2’s battle pass mere weeks before its launch. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

With more information about the standalone Warzone 2 on the horizon as part of the upcoming Call of Duty Next, some fans have wondered what exactly will be happening with the original version of Warzone. Reporter Tom Henderson on Twitter claims the game will be undergoing a name change on November 28, and that "it looks like original Warzone will continue to receive updates/DLC."

It seems the original Warzone going forward will focus primarily on the Caldera map set in the Pacific, which was introduced as part of what Activision Blizzard called "Warzone Pacific" alongside Call of Duty: Vanguard Season 1 in November 2021.

Like its predecessor, Warzone 2 will be launching some time after the October 25 release Modern Warfare 2, and will feature many of that game's mechanics, vehicles, and weapons.

Having Warzone and Warzone 2 coexist does line up with what Activision has said previously about the two battle royales, namely that Warzone will "continue on as a separate experience that will include a continuation of player progression and inventories within that Warzone experience." That means skins, weapons, and unlocks in the original Warzone will not carry over to Warzone 2.

Looking further into the future for Call of Duty, 2024's installment might tell a story about the war in Iraq. Twitter user TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty details in the past, said the campaign for 2024's Call of Duty game will cover what the US government calls Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place years earlier during the Gulf War of the nineties, the event later adapted and dramatized in 2001's Black Hawk Down.

TheGhostOfHope said it will be Raven Software developing the campaign for Call of Duty 2024. Raven also developed the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.

If Call of Duty 2024 is indeed about the Iraq war, the game will likely be contentious. Around 200,000 civilians died as a result of the war, and another game, Six Days in Fallujah, has generated a good amount of debate and discussion for its themes and elements. One could only imagine that the size and popularity of a franchise like Call of Duty addressing those horrific, real life events would result in an even larger discourse.

Sony thinks Microsoft's commitment to COD on PlayStation is "inadequate," the Xbox is getting a UI overhaul, a new Battlefield game is in development, and the Witcher 3 will be coming to current gen this year.
#GameSpot #CallOfDuty #PlayStation 

PlayStation fires back at Microsoft’s claims regarding Call of Duty exclusivity, the Xbox UI is getting an overhaul, new Battlefield games, and more on today’s GameSpot news.

Mom and Dad are fighting! PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has responded to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying his company would go above and beyond industry standards and keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for years to come if the Xbox company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard goes through. 

Ryan told GI.biz that Microsoft offered to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for specifically three years after the existing deal between Activision and Sony finishes. Ryan said this was "inadequate on many levels."

"Microsoft has only offered for Call of Duty to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends," Ryan said. "After almost 20 years of Call of Duty on PlayStation, their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take account of the impact on our gamers. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality Call of Duty experience, and Microsoft's proposal undermines this principle."

We don't know, however, what the duration of the previously agreed-upon deal between Sony and Activision for Call of Duty was. But whatever that is, it'll be extended by three years, apparently, but what happens after that is unclear. Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard is currently being reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world. New Zealand will be among the next countries to weigh in, with a decision due by September 9.

Speaking of Microsoft, the company is looking to give the Xbox UI a makeover, with a number of changes planned that will roll out as experiments for Xbox Insiders over the next few months.

A key new feature is a planned "jump back in" row, which is designed to give players quick access to their most-recently-played games and apps. System apps like Settings, Store, Search and My Games & Apps will be easier to access as they will have their own tiles on Xbox Home. Microsoft notes that the rollout will be slow to start, and that Xbox will be iterating throughout the process, but a full launch of the new UI is planned for sometime in 2023. 

While Xbox and PlayStation bicker over Call of Duty, Battlefield has been making some moves. Marcus Lehto, who designed Master Chief and co-created the Halo universe, is heading up a brand-new Battlefield studio in Seattle. Electronic Arts announced that the studio is called Ridgeline Games, and it will develop a "narrative campaign" for Battlefield. Very little is known right now, but EA said this campaign will "engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series."

Another big announcement was that Battlefield creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has worked on the Battlefield series since it started in 2002, is departing the team. 
Despite hiccups at launch, the series’ latest entry Battlefield 2042 was the fifth best-selling game of 2021 in the US. With these announcements, EA reiterated that it wants fans to know that EA is "all-in on Battlefield." The company has DICE continuing to work on Battlefield's "multiplayer suite," EA said, while another studio Ripple Effect will create an "entirely new Battlefield experience that will complement and build upon the series' foundations."

Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence is a mobile MMO that brings open-world exploration and shooting to your pocket. 
#gaming #thedivision #gamespot 

We got a chance to speak to Fabrice Navrez, executive producer on The Division Resurgence, about how the game will bring the same Division experience to your mobile game.

The Division Resurgence will open with a scene set before the events of the first game, but then transition to its main storyline, which sits between the first and second game on the timeline. Players will return to New York City and visit iconic locations like Liberty Island and Times Square. 

The game recently completed its first closed alpha test, and there was positive feedback received thus far with the MMO aspects, including the ability to meet players out in the streets of New York as opposed to only in safe zones, resulting in what Navrez called interesting encounters.

The video also details two of the six classes available in the closed alpha: the Demolitionist, who carries a heavy gun that inflicts explosive area-of-effect damage, and the Bulwark, which is a melee tank class designed to draw enemy fire and deal massive damage up-close. 

The Division Resurgence will release on iOS and Android at launch, though a specific timeframe has not yet been announced. More information will be provided during the Ubisoft Forward on September 10 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.
