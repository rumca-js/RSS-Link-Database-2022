Today we are taking a look at the Pimax 8KX and Sword controllers.. BUT this isn't just a VR headset review. We're going to be taking a full dive into the wacky weird world of Pimax as a company as well. Looking at how a company can possibly make one of the best VR headsets available, but also the worst controllers (in my opinion) ever made. But even though their Pimax headsets are pretty good, they suffer from so many weird issues. My main concern is that Pimax is about to launch new VR headsets before this one has ever been fixed- like I said It's a weird situation BUT! This will be an interesting video whether you are a Quest/ Quest 2 user, Index user, Pimax..or you don't have a VR headset at all!
