How did the Grand Theft Auto 6 leak happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar doing about it? All these questions, answered.
#Gaming #GTA6 #GrandTheftAuto6 #GTA6Leak 

Well, what else is there to talk about? The Grand Theft Auto 6 leak. How did it happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar’s response? Here’s everything you need to know about the biggest leak the gaming industry has ever seen.

Now, before we get into this, I just want to be expressly clear. Everything you are about to see is from previous GTA games. Ok. Rockstar’s legal team, if you’re listening— and I’ve heard they’re big fans of this show— we’re not showing any screenshots. Any gameplay. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Got it? Ok. Good. Here we go.

So how did the leak happen? On Sunday September 20, a user that goes by the name of teapottuberhacker posted on GTAforums.com over 90 clips of in-development footage of the game. They claimed that the clips were taken from Rockstar’s internal Slack, which also allowed them to get their hands on source code for the game.

The hacker updated their post later that day, directing any employees of Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive to contact them via email, as they were "looking to negotiate a deal." There has been no update as of this recording from the hacker.

So what was released? Well, a metric f*ton.

The footage in the 90+ clips totalled a near hour of incomplete GTA 6 gameplay. The validity of the footage before Rockstar could confirm the leak came in the form of two key details that lined up with Bloomberg’s report earlier this year about the game. One, all the gameplay took place in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami parody, and the location of the game according to Bloomberg's report. 

That report also included the detail that the player would take control of two characters, a man and a woman, whom are meant to be a Bonnie and Clyde-like type pairing. The gameplay seen in the leak featured both a playable man and woman. Pop-up text during the footage refers to the man as Jason and the woman as Lucia.

The footage showed off the characters’ abilities to crouch, go prone, and move while doing both. Going prone is something that can’t be done in GTA 5, and the only way to crouch in that game is by taking cover behind a low profile object. 

Both of these elements hint that playing stealthily might be a viable course of action in the game, particularly as the footage also reveals a mechanic to pick up bodies that you could then presumably hide.

From Fortnite to Candy Crush, concerns have long been raised about the addictive potential of video games. But when the World Health Organization classified 'Gaming disorder' as an addictive behaviour in 2018, the psychology community found itself divided.

Some believed the WHO's decision was based on poorly-constructed research, while others have reported success in treating the condition. So was the WHO right to make this decision, and does Gaming Addiction really exist?
