Nashville-based COIN are currently on tour following the release of their latest album, Uncanny Valley, and its hit single “Chapstick.” During their visit to The Current, the four-piece band — comprising Chase Lawrence, Joe Memmel, Ryan Winnen and Matt Martin — spoke with host Ayisha Jaffer about the band’s origins at Belmont University in Nashville, as well as the themes that arose in their lives and manifested themselves on the album; in particular, themes of relevance and authenticity.

In addition, Lawrence spoke about how the pandemic brought the band closer together, and how community and connection have become so vital to COIN and their fans. One improbable indicator of that connection? The deep, personal significance that can be found in nonsensical lyrics. 

Watch the complete interview above.
