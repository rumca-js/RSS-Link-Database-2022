How good of a job did Apple do with the cooling on the Mac Studio?? Well it definitely isn't as good as our custom water cooling solution, I can tell you that much.

Thanks to ASUS for sponsoring today's video! Check out ASUS ROG OLED Gaming Monitors here: https://bit.ly/3QQ5omI

Buy an Asus PG42UQ 41.5" Monitor: https://geni.us/6iSnql
Buy an Asus PG48UQ 48" Monitor: https://geni.us/cxq4w

The 42" C2 that Linus JUST installed is great, but it's not a monitor. ASUS has released their PG42UQ based on the same panel, but now with less annoying ABL and proper wake-up functionality. Despite the great display, some things don't quite go according to plan...
