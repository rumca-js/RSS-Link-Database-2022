What was in it? What is Rockstar doing about it? All these questions, answered.\n#Gaming #GTA6 #GrandTheftAuto6 #GTA6Leak \n\nWell, what else is there to talk about? The Grand Theft Auto 6 leak. How did it happen? What was in it? What is Rockstar\u2019s response? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the biggest leak the gaming industry has ever seen.\n\nNow, before we get into this, I just want to be expressly clear. Everything you are about to see is from previous GTA games. Ok. Rockstar\u2019s legal team, if you\u2019re listening\u2014 and I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re big fans of this show\u2014 we\u2019re not showing any screenshots. Any gameplay. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Got it? Ok. Good. Here we go.\n\nSo how did the leak happen? On Sunday September 20, a user that goes by the name of teapottuberhacker posted on GTAforums.com over 90 clips of in-development footage of the game. They claimed that the clips were taken from Rockstar\u2019s internal Slack, which also allowed them to get their hands on source code for the game.\n\nThe hacker updated their post later that day, directing any employees of Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive to contact them via email, as they were \"looking to negotiate a deal.\" There has been no update as of this recording from the hacker.\n\nSo what was released? Well, a metric f*ton.\n\nThe footage in the 90+ clips totalled a near hour of incomplete GTA 6 gameplay. The validity of the footage before Rockstar could confirm the leak came in the form of two key details that lined up with Bloomberg\u2019s report earlier this year about the game. One, all the gameplay took place in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto\u2019s Miami parody, and the location of the game according to Bloomberg's report. \n\nThat report also included the detail that the player would take control of two characters, a man and a woman, whom are meant to be a Bonnie and Clyde-like type pairing. The gameplay seen in the leak featured both a playable man and woman. Pop-up text during the footage refers to the man as Jason and the woman as Lucia.\n\nThe footage showed off the characters\u2019 abilities to crouch, go prone, and move while doing both. Going prone is something that can\u2019t be done in GTA 5, and the only way to crouch in that game is by taking cover behind a low profile object. \n\nBoth of these elements hint that playing stealthily might be a viable course of action in the game, particularly as the footage also reveals a mechanic to pick up bodies that you could then presumably hide.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZGdKumGlIk", "date_published": "2022-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2019: 10 Things You Never Knew", "description": "War\u2026 War never changes.

From Santa Claus to giant teddy bears, Infinity Ward went no hold barred into their easter eggs for Modern Warfare 2019. Although Call of Duty Games can get a reputation for being \u201cthrown together\u201d because of their yearly release schedule, the 2019 reboot of Modern Warfare proves that Infinity Ward could put together a new style of Call of Duty game with a well planned year full of map, modes, and weapon releases. The level of detail, fun, and goofy secrets throughout the game elevate the entire experience to something more than just \u201canother Call of Duty game.\u201d In fact, The animations and attention to detail were so well done that both Call of Duty Cold War and Call of Duty Vanguard kept the same animations.
