Hello. Bonelab is releasing in 5 days. 

It may sound like I'm doing a little bit of "fanboying" and ya know what? You'd be right. I'll be real, there aren't many VR games that really REALLY get me excited. A game like this usually comes around once every few years, and to me, Bonelab is that game. Turns out I am not the only one, tens of thousands are just as excited as I am, it's one of the most wishlisted games on steam, one of the most of any VR game ever, and everyone's talking about it. So, here's my explanation why. 

This is also likely one of the most important VR games to ever release. of course. 

BoneLab will release on Quest 2 and PCVR (SteamVR) on September 29th 2022. Get ready! I'll likely post another video once I have finally played it.
