There are a lot of statistics and figures that illustrate just how rich the Royal Family is, that until last week was led by Queen Elizabeth II. However, most of these numbers are inaccurate, to say the least.\n\nKing Charles III is now the reigning monarch of the British Empire, or at least what remains of it. And with that, he's now the head of the wealthiest (and arguably most powerful) family on the planet. And according to the highest laws that govern land ownership, Charles now owns every single piece of land in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and many other places.\n\nBut there's more to Charles' newfound power. Like laws that enable his family's secrets to be preserved, and his wealth to be hidden. Things that are likely not to change under the new monarch's watch.\n\nDid you know all this about the royal family?
