Shows are getting axed, layoffs, CNN+ existed.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m gonna talk about it. Batgirl, Scoob 2, DC, all that stuff. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m right, maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe Dwayne the Rock Johnson will save us all.\n\nThere\u2019s just so many baffling decisions, and some are justified, and some are just fallout from the previous owners, but sometimes it\u2019s just truly bizarre stuff that I can barely wrap my head around.\n\nI\u2019m personally leaning on \u201cit\u2019s all over\u201d for the company, but what do I know.\n\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8u5wXP0r6Q", "date_published": "2022-09-15 19:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
