WHO response

WHO acted too cautiously and too slowly

Several important matters

To warn about human transmissibility of the virus

To declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern

To support international travel protocols designed to slow the spread of the virus

(This delay contributed to the spread of the virus and limited the possibilities for risk mitigation.)

To endorse the public use of face masks as protective gear

To recognise the airborne transmission of the virus.

(These delayed and vague recommendations from WHO continued until late April, 2021.) 

Just 1 example, after receiving an open letter

From 238 scientists in July, 2020,

asking the organisation to address airborne transmission

WHO did not change until April 30, 2021.

Multiple failures of international cooperation

Too many governments have failed to adhere to basic norms of institutional rationality and transparency, 

and the world's major powers have failed to collaborate to control the pandemic.

Specific points

Lack of timely notification of the initial outbreak of COVID-19

Costly delays in acknowledging the crucial airborne exposure pathway of SARS-CoV-2, 

and in implementing appropriate measures at national and global levels to slow the spread of the virus.

Lack of coordination among countries regarding suppression strategies

Failure of governments to examine evidence and adopt best practices for controlling the pandemic,

and managing economic and social spillovers

Shortfall of global funding for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs)

Failure to ensure adequate global supplies and equitable distribution of key commodities,

protective gear, diagnostics, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines

Lack of timely, accurate, systematic data

Infections, deaths, viral variants, health system responses, and indirect health consequences

Again the report raised lab leak possibility

Poor enforcement of appropriate levels of biosafety regulations in the lead-up to the pandemic, 

raising the possibility of a laboratory-related outbreak

Failure to combat systematic disinformation

Lack of global and national safety nets to protect populations experiencing vulnerability.

As of May 31, 2022

There were 6·9 million reported deaths and 17·2 million estimated deaths from COVID-19

This staggering death toll is both a profound tragedy and a massive global failure at multiple levels. 

Sustainable development process

Set back by several years, 

Deep underfinancing, Sustainable Development Goals and,

aims of the Paris Climate Agreement.

Viral origins

The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. 

There are two leading hypotheses: 

that the virus emerged as a zoonotic spillover from wildlife or a farm animal, 

possibly through a wet market, 

in a location that is still undetermined; 

or that the virus emerged from a research-related incident, 

during the field collection of viruses,

or through a laboratory-associated escape. 

No independent, transparent, and science-based investigation has been carried out regarding the bioengineering of SARS-like viruses that was underway before the outbreak of COVID-19. 

The laboratory notebooks, databases, email records, and samples of institutions involved in such research have not been made available to independent researchers. 

Independent researchers have not yet investigated the US laboratories engaged in the laboratory manipulation of SARS-CoV-like viruses, 

nor have they investigated the details of the laboratory research that had been underway in Wuhan.

US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has resisted disclosing details of the research on SARS-CoV-related viruses that it had been supporting,

providing extensively redacted information only as required by Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.

In brief, there are many potential proximal origins of SARS-CoV-2, but there is still a shortfall of independent, scientific, and collaborative work on the issue. 

The search for the origins of the virus requires unbiased, independent, transparent, and rigorous work by international teams in the fields of virology, epidemiology, bioinformatics, 

and other related fields, and supported by all governments.

In the absence of an unbiased, independent, and rigorous search for a natural origin by a multidisciplinary team of experts alongside an unbiased, independent, and rigorous investigation of the research-related hypotheses, 

the public's trust in science will be imperilled, 

with potentially grave long-term repercussions. 

It is therefore crucial to investigate all hypotheses fully, 

not only to ascertain the source of the pandemic and to protect against future emerging infectious diseases, 

but also to ensure the integrity of science itself. 

The perceived lack of transparency to date by leading scientific agencies and laboratories is troubling and needs to be addressed.

Strategies to prevent research-related releases should include stronger international and national oversight of biosafety, 

biosecurity, and biorisk management, 

including the strict regulation of gain of function research of concern.

When investigating the origins of any novel pathogen, 

potential hypotheses should not be prematurely rejected to ensure that time-sensitive data—

such as early case information and laboratory records—are collected.
