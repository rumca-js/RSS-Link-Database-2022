Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of \"En El Olvido,\" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. \n\nIn the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancol\u00eda as the band slips into the easy R&B number \"Evergreen.\"  \"We're about to get more sad,\" he says to the crowd with a grin. \n\nDespite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert \u2014 an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through \"Evergreen\" and \"Petrified\" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat \"Endlessly.\"  El coraz\u00f3n puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. \n\nAs Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: \"I want y'all to think about something,\u201d he says. \u201cI want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge.\" He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m playing!\u201d But as his and the band\u2019s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there\u2019s only room for building each other up. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cEn El Olvido\u201d\n\u201cEvergreen\u201d\n\u201cPetrified\u201d\n\u201cEndlessly\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Apollo: vocals\nJonah Feingold: guitar\nJackson Shanks: drums\nManny Barajas: bass\nHarrison Hawkins: keys, music director\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\nBrian Antonio Gazo Martinez: vocals\nFabian Anthony Chavez: saxophone\nMarcus Clayton Paul: trumpet\nSilvia Estrada: guitarr\u00f3n\nMayra Mart\u00ednez: guitarr\u00f3n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAnimator: Alant\u00e9 Serene\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Pierre Kattar\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #ElTiny #OmarApollo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p78XATPcyg", "date_published": "2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
