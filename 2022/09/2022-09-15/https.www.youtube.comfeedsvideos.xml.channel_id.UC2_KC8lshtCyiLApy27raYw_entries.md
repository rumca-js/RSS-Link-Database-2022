Warner Bros Discovery and HBO Max are collapsing in a beautiful way. Shows are getting axed, layoffs, CNN+ existed.

So today, I’m gonna talk about it. Batgirl, Scoob 2, DC, all that stuff. 

Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Dwayne the Rock Johnson will save us all.

There’s just so many baffling decisions, and some are justified, and some are just fallout from the previous owners, but sometimes it’s just truly bizarre stuff that I can barely wrap my head around.

I’m personally leaning on “it’s all over” for the company, but what do I know.
