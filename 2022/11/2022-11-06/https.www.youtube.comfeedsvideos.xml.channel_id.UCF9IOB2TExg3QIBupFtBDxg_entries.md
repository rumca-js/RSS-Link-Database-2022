WHO provide a helpful guide on how to report misinformation online

Inaccurate information spreads widely and at speed, 

making it more difficult for the public to identify verified facts and advice from trusted sources, such as their local health authority or WHO.

As a starting point in the UK, only NHS organisations are being invited to self-certify against the NHS Standard for Creating Health Content. 

By completing the self-certification process, an NHS organisation channel will be eligible for information panels indicating NHS credibility. 

From FDA to MHRA: are drug regulators for hire?

https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1538.full

Regulatory agencies, large proportions of their budgets,

funded by the industry they are sworn to regulate

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

1992, Prescription Drug User Fee Act, allowing industry to fund the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directly through “user fees” 

Net PDUFA fees collected

$29m in 1993

$884m in 2016 (65% of budget)

FDA, 9 out of 10 of its past commissioners between 2006 and 2019 went on to secure roles linked with pharmaceutical companies

European Medicines Agency (EMA)

Industry fees funded 20% European Medicines Agency (EMA), in 1995

By 2010, 75%

Today, 89%

Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

86% of funding from Pharmaceutical Industry

Australia

Proportion of TGA budget derived from industry, 96%

WHO funding

The second-largest funder is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provides 9.8% of the WHO's funds

Appendix

It was expected that Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year 2050

The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible.

The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings.

Covid infection did not increase incidence of post-covid myocarditis or pericarditis.

The Incidence of Myocarditis and Pericarditis in Post COVID-19 Unvaccinated Patients-A Large Population-Based Study

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm

Myocarditis and pericarditis, post-acute cardiac sequelae of COVID-19 infection, 

arising from adaptive immune responses. 

? incidence

Retrospective cohort study

Study group, had infection

N = 196,992 adults after COVID-19 infection

(Clalit Health Services)

March 2020 to January 2021

Inpatient myocarditis and pericarditis diagnoses,

from day 10 after positive PCR

Israeli vaccination program initiated on 20 December 2020

Follow-up was censored on 28 February 2021

Control cohort, never infected

N = 590,976 adults,

with at least one negative PCR and no positive PCR

(age- and sex-matched)

Calculated backward from 15 December 2020

Results

Post-COVID-19 group

Nine post-COVID-19 patients developed myocarditis (0.0046%)

Eleven diagnosed with pericarditis (0.0056%)

Control group, never covid infected

27 developed myocarditis (0.0046%) P = 1

52 developed pericarditis (0.0088%) P = 0.17


Adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]

Myocarditis, male (aHR 4.42) regardless of previous COVID-19 infection

Pericarditis, (aHR 1.93)

Peripheral vascular disease, (aHR 4.20)

Follow up

Median, 4.1 months

Covid cohort, 700,040 person-months

Non covid cohort, 2,100,077 person-months 

Conclusions

Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with myocarditis (aHR 1.08)

Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with pericarditis (aHR 0.53)

We did not observe an increased incidence of neither pericarditis nor myocarditis in adult patients recovering from COVID-19 infection.



Our data suggest that there is no increase in the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in COVID-19 recovered patients,

compared to uninfected matched controls.
