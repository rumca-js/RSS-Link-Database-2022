So if you\u2019re sensitive to that type of spoilers then you'll want to start looking at muting keywords on social media.\n\nWhen it comes to new Pokemon that haven\u2019t leaked, Gimmeghoul was revealed over the weekend and the official Pokemon Twitter account has announced a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will air tomorrow November 8 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019ve seen enough Pokemon trailers and you want something new to get excited for, then you might want to pay attention to Wednesday November 9th.\u00a0\n\nThere is a Nintendo Indie World Showcase scheduled to take place Wednesday, November 9 at 9am PT / 12pm ET and it will run for about 25 minutes. There have not been any specific games mentioned, but for comparison sake, the last Indie world features games like Ooblets, Silt and Gunbrella, a game that I recently played a demo for on Steam Deck and I\u2019m very excited for the full release.\u00a0\n\nAnother game I\u2019m waiting for is Final Fantasy XVI, a game that you\u2019ll need a PS5 for if you\u2019re not willing to be patient. We\u2019ve already known for some time that the game would be an exclusive, but now a new Playstation commercial has confirmed\u2013at around the 14 second mark\u2013that FF16 will be a PS5 exclusive for only 6 months. This timeframe pales in comparison to another upcoming Square Enix release, Forspoken, which launches January 24 and will be a PlayStation console exclusive for two years\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Pok\u00e9mon Leaks\n01:13 - Indie World\n01:37 - Final Fantasy XVI\n02:20 - Ubisoft on Steam?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sp5MmAw8Us", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers First 20 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Sonic is back with Sonic Frontiers, and here are the first 20 minutes of Kronos Island, the first of many open zones Sonic finds himself in.\n\nSonic Frontiers is Sega's latest foray with their titular mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog. For Sonic Frontiers, they've taken inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while also learning from the failures and successes of previous titles like Sonic Forces, to create an all new style for Sonic Frontiers with an Open Zone gameplay.\n\nSonic Frontiers features two main segments, open zone gameplay moments and cyber space levels similar to former Sonic games. The Open Zone gameplay is reminiscent of other open world games, with Sonic free to explore and tackle challenges as he pleases, all while gathering various items and upgrades he'll need to progress both the story and his stats.\n\nNew to Sonic Frontiers is a completely revamped battle system, allowing Sonic to not only bash enemies, but also combo and chain various attacks against them, with many mini-bosses forcing players to use Sonic's speed and platforming skillset, along with combos, to defeat them.\n\nIn this video, you'll see both the Open Zone of Kronos as well as multiple Cyber Space levels.\n\n#sonicfrontiers #sonicgameplay", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv4DNw71JEo", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers Review", "description": "Sonic Frontiers marks a bold new direction for the series, meshing traditional Sonic action with an open-ended approach to progression and exploration across its semi-open world.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCZmQWoZOCo", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Blight: Survival \u2013 Official Gameplay Reveal", "description": "Check out 5 minutes of pre-alpha gameplay footage for Blight: Survival a third person action adventure survival game.\n\n#blightsurival #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLkFmbMusQI", "date_published": "2022-11-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Pok\u00e9mon Violet Gimmighoul Official Story Trailer", "description": "Learn more about Gimmighoul who has not only made its way into Pokemon Go but also making its way into Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
