The Home Assistant project came a long way and currently is the de facto standard for serious home automation. Time to show you my setup. Because, of course, it has some specialties. We will go through nine hurdles and find a solution for each of them. Watching this video might save you valuable time.

Why two boards (options)?
HA Automations or Node-Red?
Installation of HA
Terminal and RSA key
Install HACS
Install File Editor
Install Node-Red Companion and Node-Red WebSocket support
Show containers in HA window
Install ESPHome and create Example sensors
Flash Sonoff S26 Smart Plug
Write data to another server
