  <p id="eSpSBY">After Apple issued several copyright claims, YouTube took down an archival channel containing hundreds of decades-old videos from past Apple Worldwide Developer Conferences (WWDC). <a href="https://twitter.com/realmrpippy/status/1588595461438390272?s=20&amp;t=m3RD9ad0quvc1nw2A0ReoQ">Brendan Shanks</a>, the owner of the Apple WWDC Videos channel, says his account’s been permanently disabled after receiving well over three copyright strikes — the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000#zippy=%2Cwhat-happens-when-you-get-a-copyright-strike%2Ccourtesy-period%2Chow-to-get-info-about-your-strike%2Cresolve-a-copyright-strike">maximum number of violations</a> you can incur before YouTube removes your account.</p>
<p id="7QHoLB">In screenshots of emails shared by Shanks, Apple issued a number of takedown requests against his videos, some of which dated back to the early 2000s. Shanks says he still has all the original video files and descriptions, and is currently trying to get the content over to the Internet Archive. Apple didn’t immediately...</p>

## Apple reportedly wants to swap the ‘Hey Siri’ trigger phrase for just ‘Siri’

  <p id="hQ6Jho">Apple’s looking to change Siri’s trigger phrase from “Hey Siri,” to just “Siri,” according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman. This means you would just need to say “Siri” followed by a command to activate the smart assistant.</p>
<p id="v2A5t9">As noted by Gurman, Apple’s been working on this feature for the past several months and is expected to roll it out next year or in 2024. But Apple will have to put in a “significant amount of AI training and underlying engineering work,” to get the feature to function properly, as the smart assistant will need to understand the single wake word in multiple accents and dialects. The current, two-word trigger phrase, “Hey Siri,” increases the chance of Siri picking up on it.</p>
