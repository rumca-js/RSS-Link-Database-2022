So it sounds like the remake itself won\u2019t be a simple one off.\n\nIt also sounds like the remake will incorporate mechanics and elements from other games in the franchise that followed. the original\u2019s release, with senior game designer Andy Schmoll stating that the team is, \"exploring new and innovative tech and ideas, as well as features and elements from the other Splinter Cell titles\".\n\nUnfortunately, this will be the last update for the much anticipated remake for a while, as the team will be, \u201cgoing dark for a little while so it can focus on making the absolute best game possible.\"\n\nIn the meantime, fans both new and old can experience the original game, which initially was an exclusive for the very first Xbox, for the great deal of free. The deal can be obtained via Ubisoft itself for the PC.\n\nSpeaking of Xbox, Ubisoft, and deals, Black Friday discounts for the two gaming giants are already out in the wild.\n\nXbox is discounting its Series S console to $250. Highlights of its game sales include Madden NFL 23 for $35, Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands: Next Level Edition also for $35, and the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt: Game of the Year Edition for $10, which will be getting a free next gen upgrade in December.\n\nFrom Ubisoft, 2020\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, last year\u2019s Far Cry 6, and this year\u2019s Rainbow Six Extraction can all be nabbed for under $20. For both Xbox and Ubisoft\u2019s full list of deals, as well as our complete collection of Black Friday discounts, head to GameSpot dot com.\n\nIf you do pick up a shiny new Xbox Series S on sale, you\u2019re going to want to apply the latest software update, which brings some much welcome additions and tweaks to the platform, the biggest of which being tighter integration with Discord.\n\nDiscord integration launched for Xbox Insiders back in July and for all console users in September, but previously you had to transfer the call from Discord to your console via the Xbox mobile app. Now, you can activate chatting directly from the console itself.\n\nTIMECODES:\n\n00:00 - Splinter Cell remake first look\n01:32 - Black Friday deals\n02:18 - Xbox November update", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsaiRZNpAro", "date_published": "2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Midnight Suns The Final Preview", "description": "The early hours of Marvel's Midnight Suns have sold us on the combat, but not quite on the story, despite some standout characters.\n#gaming #Marvle #MidnightSuns \n\nSo far, I really enjoy Marvel's Midnight Suns, having now played about 15 hours of the tactical RPG, which pulls inspiration from the XCOM games. Removing XCOM's frustrating percentage system--which could cause even the most well-planned strategies to have a chance of just not working--makes the turn-based tactical combat in Midnight Suns a lot more fun. And thanks to the deckbuilding card system, randomness still factors into the equation, creating a healthy bit of challenge.\n\nYou can expect more words from me regarding the actual gameplay of Midnight Suns when the full review embargo is up. For now, I want to briefly touch on an aspect of Midnight Suns we haven't really had a chance to see a whole lot of yet: the writing and story. \n\nTo recap, in Midnight Suns you play as the Hunter, prophesied to defeat your mother, Lilith, and seal away her dark magic forever. You're assigned leadership of the latest iteration of the Midnight Suns, a team composed of superheroes with powers that dabble in the mystic and supernatural, going out to face Lilith's demonic forces and the members of HYDRA she's enthralled. Lilith's war on humanity attracts the attention of less magically-inclined heroes as well, and so your efforts are also bolstered by members of the Avengers and X-Men. Each character features their own unique abilities, portrayed as cards within a deck, allowing you to switch up your strategies depending on who you bring on a mission.\n\nI wasn't expecting a story quite so action hero-focused given the namesake Midnight Suns is pulling from. It's a bit by-the-numbers, even by the standards of superhero fiction, so major plot points can be seen coming from a mile away and moments of grief or tragedy aren't given adequate room to fester, as the more wise-cracking heroes are quick to fill the silence with jokes to liven up the situation. So far, that's keeping the game's story from being great, but it's certainly not bad by any stretch. If you've watched any of the team-oriented MCU movies, you already kind of know what you're getting with Midnight Suns--this game feels more like the MCU's lighthearted take on Age of Ultron and less like the darker Midnight Suns comic book series. \n\nBetween the major plot points, Midnight Suns allows you to explore optional, more personal side stories. And it's in those smaller interactions between the Hunter and the individual members of their team that the game manages to squeeze out some incredible moments. Building up your friendship with certain heroes unlocks additional cutscenes and conversations with them, many of which culminate in heartwarming reveals or devastating discoveries. Magik, in particular, is one of the best-written characters in Midnight Suns, and her friendship arc with the Hunter--which sees the two bond over their respective struggles with their innate darkness--has been my favorite part of the game thus far.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy0laO7oAbg", "date_published": "2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Review", "description": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet's open-world approach reinvigorates the long-running series.\n\n#pokemon #pokemonscarletandviolet #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDMdYRUJ8hE", "date_published": "2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Callisto Protocol - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Watch The Callisto Protocol Official Launch Trailer featuring the song 'Lost Again' by Kings Elliot.
