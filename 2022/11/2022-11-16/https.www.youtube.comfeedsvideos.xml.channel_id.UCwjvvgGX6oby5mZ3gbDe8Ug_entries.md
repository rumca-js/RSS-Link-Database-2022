This young man, Wang Jingyu, is one of the targets of the Chinese Communist Party's overseas manhunt. In the hunt for him, the Chinese Communist Party CCP has used not only the police force in China but has activated its overseas police force. In China, the phone number to call the police is "110", so the CCP's overseas police are also known as the "Overseas 110 Agency".
