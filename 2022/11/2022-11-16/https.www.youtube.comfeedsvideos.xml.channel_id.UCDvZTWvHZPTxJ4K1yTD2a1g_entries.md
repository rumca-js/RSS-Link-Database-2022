This week we're continuing our journey in trading from a ‚Ç¨0.10 night goblin to a Warlord titan - this time by painting up the $2000 Adeptus Custodes army we've traded for. The one army that Mr Henry Cavill, super man himself, always talk about in interviews. Hopefully once its all painted up we've got a great chance to trade for that elusive Forgeworld warlord titan - to build up and paint so we can auction that off for charity!
