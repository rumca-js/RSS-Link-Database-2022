The one army that Mr Henry Cavill, super man himself, always talk about in interviews. Hopefully once its all painted up we've got a great chance to trade for that elusive Forgeworld warlord titan - to build up and paint so we can auction that off for charity!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/squidmarminiatures \n\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f Squidmar Brushes & Exclusive miniatures: https://www.squidmar.com/latepledge \n\ud83d\udc4d Squidmars website for full list of gear I use: https://www.squidmar.com/gear  \n\ud83d\udc55 Order Squidmar Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/squidmarminiatures\n\n__________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0fEU/UK hobby store affiliate - Reference code for extra store credit: EMI7383 \nhttps://elementgames.co.uk/paints-hobby-and-scenery/element-essentials/egaps/squidmar-miniatures?d=10425\n\n_____________________\n\nAmazon Affiliate Links to stuff i use(As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases you do after following this link - at no cost to you):\n\nCanon M50 (the cameras i use)\nUSA: https://amzn.to/2MWGIN9\nUK: https://amzn.to/2PBlkyT\nDE: https://amzn.to/2PA1Nio\nCAN: https://amzn.to/2MTqaoT\n\nAnycubic i3 Mega (the FDM printer i use)\nUSA: https://amzn.to/2FSRDly\nUK: https://amzn.to/2xu0Hsz\nDEUTSCHLAND: https://amzn.to/2JdquvX\nCANADA: https://amzn.to/2YA95CW\n\nHARDER STEENBECK EVOLUTION SILVERLINE (the Airbrush I use)\nUSA https://amzn.to/2ZO6HrI\nUK https://amzn.to/2Ll5LGm\nGERMANY https://amzn.to/2LmurOD\nCANADA  https://amzn.to/2NGv3S2 \n\nPhrozen Sonic Mini (the Resin printer I use):\nWorldwide: https://phrozen3d.com/collections/resin-3d-printer-phrozen/products/phrozen-sonic-mini-resin-3d-printer?aff=43\nUSA Amazon: https://amzn.to/2FuFsyl \n\nPhrozen Sonic Mini 4k\nWorldwide: https://phrozen3d.com/products/sonic-mini-4k-resin-3d-printer-phrozen?aff=43\n\n_____________________\n\nEmil On \nInstagram http://www.instagram.com/ageofsquidmar\nfacebook  http://www.facebook.com/ageofsquidmar\nTwitter http://www.twitter.com/ageofsquidmar\nLukas instagram: https://www.instagram.com/seth_miniatures/\n\n_____________________\n\nPainting miniatures for your warhammer & d&amp;d games.
