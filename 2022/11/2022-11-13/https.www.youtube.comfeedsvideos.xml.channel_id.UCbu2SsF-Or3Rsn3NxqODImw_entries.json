Check out GameSpot's Review.\n\nIn Pentiment, you play as artist Andreas Maler, who is attempting to finish up his masterpiece while working for the Kiersau Abbey, which overlooks the Bavarian town of Tassing. A visiting baron draws the ire of both the farmers and craftspeople in town, as well as the Christian nuns and brothers of the abbey, but no one is prepared when he winds up dead. With Andreas' mentor--a man too old and feeble to have possibly overpowered the baron--pinned for the crime, the young illustrator vows to conduct his own private investigation in hopes of bringing the true culprit to justice. In doing so, Andreas is drawn into a strange conspiracy of cryptic notes and unspoken secrets, and his actions shape both Tassing and Kiersau Abbey in a story that spans a quarter of a century.\n\n#gaming #gamename #gamespot #pentiment", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv90tC1OhSQ", "date_published": "2022-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Project LLL Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Check out the gameplay footage for Project LLL, now in development.\n\nProject LLL is an upcoming open-world massively multiplayer online third-person shooter currently in development.
