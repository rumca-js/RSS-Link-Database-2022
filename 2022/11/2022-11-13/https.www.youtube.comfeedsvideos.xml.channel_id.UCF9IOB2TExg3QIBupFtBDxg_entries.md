Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

9,400 covid linked deaths last week

Almost 90% less than in February of this year

(February 2022, 75,000 a week, globally)

We have come a long way, and this is definitely cause for optimism. 

But we continue to call on all governments, communities and individuals to remain vigilant

Almost 10,000 deaths a week is 10,000 too many for a disease that can be prevented and treated

WHO continues to urge caution, and we continue to urge everyone to be fully vaccinated – including getting your next dose if it’s due.

Get all the recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine
Keep a safe distance from others, especially in closed spaces
When indoors, open windows if possible
Wear a mask if you’re or those around you are at high risk of severe illness
Keep hands clean
Cover coughs and sneezes
Stay home when feeling unwel

Seven days down to 5

Stop trying to identify "secondary" contacts

Looking incremental

So

Five and a half more people registered with a GP than the total population

We also know there are millions in England not registered with a GP
