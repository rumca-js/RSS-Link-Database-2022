Pentiment too often limits its most enjoyable pieces to reach an ending that makes sense but is still unfulfilling. Check out GameSpot's Review.

In Pentiment, you play as artist Andreas Maler, who is attempting to finish up his masterpiece while working for the Kiersau Abbey, which overlooks the Bavarian town of Tassing. A visiting baron draws the ire of both the farmers and craftspeople in town, as well as the Christian nuns and brothers of the abbey, but no one is prepared when he winds up dead. With Andreas' mentor--a man too old and feeble to have possibly overpowered the baron--pinned for the crime, the young illustrator vows to conduct his own private investigation in hopes of bringing the true culprit to justice. In doing so, Andreas is drawn into a strange conspiracy of cryptic notes and unspoken secrets, and his actions shape both Tassing and Kiersau Abbey in a story that spans a quarter of a century.

#Gaming #TheWitcher3 #Warzone2 

Toss a coin to your Witcher, because Geralt is getting a next gen makeover before the end of the year.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's next-gen update will launch on December 14, CD Projekt Red has announced. The upgrade arrives as part of the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

CD Projekt Red is promising a "plethora of enhancements" such as ray-tracing, faster loading times, and new content based on The Witcher Netflix series. More details on the new content included in the Complete Edition will be announced during a livestream next week.

The Complete Edition includes the base game, all DLC, and the two major expansions: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. At launch, the Complete Edition will be digital-only, but a physical version is coming later.

For anyone who already owns The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, they can get the next-gen upgrades for free. The PS4 and Xbox One versions of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are also welcoming "numerous improvements" and the Netflix content, but not until later on.

The Witcher 3 was Game of the Year at the 2015 Game Awards, which this years’ nominees for have just been announced.

Unsurprisingly, the 2022 pack is led by heavyweight blockbusters God of War Ragnarok at 10 nominations, while Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West have 7 nominations each.

In a big surprise, Stray has the third-largest number of nominations for a single game, with this indie title having earned 6 nominations in total. Overall, Sony has games with a combined total of 20 nominations, Annapurna Interactive and Nintendo share second place with 11 nominations each, and Bandai Namco's games have an impressive 8 nominations across the 30 award categories.

The Game Awards will once again be hosted by Geoff Keighley, and like previous shows, it will feature more than just the titular awards. The event has become a showcase for game reveals, with each award category usually bookended by new games making their debut and updates on highly anticipated titles before they release. The return of Crash Bandicoot has been teased for the 2022 Game Awards, and the show launched its own Discord server ahead of the main event.

Nominees for Game of the Year include A Plague Tale: Requiem, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, Stray, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3. For the full list of nominees across all categories, head to the link in the description.

How are liminal spaces used in video games, and what makes them so terrifying? 
#gaming #gamespot #superliminal #liminalspace 

From the original DOOM to Gone Home; liminal spaces have crept their way into the experiences we love, a lot of the time without us noticing. In addition to examining big-name titles that happen to have liminal spaces in them, I played four games that use liminal spaces as their backdrop. Superliminal, Anemoiapolis, Escape the Backrooms, and Dream Logic. Let's explore what makes them so gosh darn scary.
