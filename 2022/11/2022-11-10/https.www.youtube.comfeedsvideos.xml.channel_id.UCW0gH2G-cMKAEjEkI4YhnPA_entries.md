Check out Gandalf's Staff: https://bit.ly/GandalfNOTR

We take an up-close look at Gandalf the Grey's Staff with Pipe & Nail (UC 3108), as well as compare it to his light-up Moria Staff (UC 3328)!

Product Description: The staff of Gandalf the Grey is a symbol of his status as an 'Istari', or Wizard. It was once owned by Radagast the Brown, crafted from an upturned, twisted sapling once crowned with twig and root-like protrusions, but now all broken and worn down. As well as being Gandalf's trusted walking stick and a fighting weapon when in need, it holds a deep magical power. Radagast's rune mark is carved into the side and the crown features a grooved shape that once held Radagast's blue crystal, now serving as a place for Gandalf to store his pipe. Pushed into the side of the staff is a nail spike which Gandalf uses as a tobacco tamper, and once used to scratch a rune into the door of Bilbo Baggins home in Hobbiton.United Cutlery's Staff of Gandalf the Grey is an authentic replica of the movie prop cast in polyresin with authentic details and coloring. The attached polyresin pipe and spike replicas are removable, and the staff comes with a polystone wall display that matches the display design of United's other staff replicas from The Hobbit.

While this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)
