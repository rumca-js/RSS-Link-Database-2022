Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Schulz discuss the formation of the comedic premise, the necessity and power of play, how self esteem and the internet have helped fuel our modern world and fragmented woke-ness, and why Schulz decided to release his hit special on his own, despite mainstream interest.
 
Andrew Schulz is an American stand up comic, podcast host, actor, and producer. Schulz began his standup journey in college at the University of California, where he also earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. From there he both hosted and appeared on numerous MTV shows such as Guy Code and The Hook Up. In 2015 Schulz starred in the IFC series Benders, and appeared as a recurring character in Amazon’s Sneaky Pete up until 2017. That same year, he released his first comedy special, 4:1:1, on Youtube. He followed this up in 2018 with the special 5:1:1 which went on to top the charts on Amazon, iTunes, Apple Music, Google Play, and Billboard. He has released multiple comedy EP’s, as well as produced and hosted multiple podcasts, such as The Brilliant Idiots which he co-hosts with Charlamagne tha God, and Flagrant 2 which he shares with fellow comics Akaash Singh, Mark Gagnon, and the video editor known as AlexxMedia. Most recently in 2022, Schulz published yet another free-on-Youtube comedy special, Infamous, which he infamously chose not to release on major streaming platforms, despite express interest.
