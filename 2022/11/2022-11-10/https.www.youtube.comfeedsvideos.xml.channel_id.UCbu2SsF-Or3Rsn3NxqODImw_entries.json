Part of this has to do with the long shadow cast by its directly-inspired and much-beloved younger sibling, Final Fantasy Tactics. Despite receiving an incredible remake in 2011, PSP exclusivity once again limited the audience for Tactics Ogre. Now, with the release of the HD and massively revamped Tactics Ogre Reborn on every platform under the sun, Square Enix is taking steps to correct a long-standing injustice--though some quibbles with presentation and gameplay changes keep this from being the definitive version of the all-time classic.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38rHWkexJQM", "date_published": "2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Top 23 Things We Had To Test: COD Modern Warfare 2", "description": "We test what can stop the currently broken Riot Shield, if you can hang off of the skids of a helicopter, what happens when you shock a Proximity Mine out of someone\u2019s hands, how many shield bashes it takes to get to the center of a Juggernaut, and more.\n\nHang off the skids of a helicopter? - 00:00\nIntro - 00:25\nWhat can stop a Riot Shield? - 00:36\nHow many hits with the Riot Shield to kill a Juggernaut? - 03:01\nEscape a Proximity Mine by dolphin diving? - 04:00\nWhat equipment can shock sticks destroy?\u00a0- 04:50\nWhat can you hack or DDOS? - 07:12\nHow many times can you and an enemy hack a mine? - 08:37\nWhat walls can you shoot through? - 09:13\nFunny kill montage - 11:21\n\n #gaming  #callofduty  #gamespot #modernwarfare2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Lf1axItFM", "date_published": "2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "DMZ Gameplay Revealed, Gamers React | GameSpot News", "description": "Warzone 2.0 and DMZ gameplay are revealed during special livestreams from popular Call of Duty content creators.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #Warzone2 #DMZ\n\nCall of Duty fans were pleasantly surprised yesterday when Infinity Ward held an invite only Warzone 2.0 event.\u00a0\n\nCall of Duty creators like CouRage, ModernWarzone, NoisyButters and more played the game for their audiences and showed off a lot of what was detailed in the most recent Call of Duty blog post. This includes loadouts, various points of interest, and 3rd person mode.\u00a0\n\nThere was also a lot of looting and inventory management shown off. Content creator Repullze took to Twitter to clarify some confusion about the new system and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything away, they technically just added. You have an \u2018on person\u2019 inventory that\u2019s your standard WZ1 system and then there\u2019s your backpack that adds slots. Everything in your on person inventory auto picks up.\u201d\n\nRepullze continued by saying when you loot someone, the backpack auto fills things you need with the examples being armor plates or ammo stacking on top of what you already have in those slots.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeems simple enough, but the system\u2019s reveal has drawn plenty of criticism and so has DMZ as a whole. DMZ is an open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where players fight alone or together with the aim of getting to the chopper to escape. On their way, players will take part in \"faction-based\" missions and side objectives, as they fight against other human and AI players before exfiltration at the end of the round.\n\nIce Man Isaac reacted to the mode and said \u201cI think DMZ should be delayed. Let Warzone 2.0 go crazy on Nov 16th and keep working on DMZ until it's ready.\u201d TimTheTatMan had a similar reaction and said, \u201cdmz looked kinda meh. warzone 2 looked solid and I\u2019m excited for next week. 3rd person warzone 2 tho looked litttttt\u201d.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tex648vF3vw", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "God Of War Ragnarok\u2019s Immersive Mode Is The Way To Play", "description": "God of War Ragnarok is stunning, and if you want to truly appreciate all the detailed environments, enemies, and characters, this just might be the best way to experience Kratos\u2019 latest adventure.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #gamespot #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJ7dbua12Q", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - World Intro Official 4K Trailer", "description": "Following the fate of the guardsmen from the first teaser two years ago, check out this new world intro trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide! \n\n#DARKTIDE #Warhammer #Warhammer40k", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-DtwQUCWx4", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
