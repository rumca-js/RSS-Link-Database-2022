Yet the band and cast of The Lion King were ecstatic to spend their one free day traveling from New York to Washington, D.C. to celebrate 25 years of the iconic musical with a performance at NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk.\n\nMany of the songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice will be familiar \u2014 like the Oscar-winning \u201cCan You Feel the Love Tonight\u201d and \u201cHakuna Matata.\u201d But the cast also treated the enthusiastic Tiny Desk crowd to songs written just for the stage. \u201cThey Live In You\u201d wasn\u2019t in the original movie, but is sung in the show by Mufasa (L. Steven Taylor) to his cub Simba (Brandon A. McCall). The young lioness Nala sings \u201cShadowland'', another gem from the musical sung by Pearl Khwezi (the first South African cast in the role).\n\nInfused throughout the music of The Lion King is spine-tingling African rhythm and language. It\u2019s as captivating as the groundbreaking costume design by director, co-writer and artist Julie Taymor. The team at Disney Theatrical sent the masks of Simba and Nala in time to be prominently displayed on the desk during the concert. Examining their details up close gave me chills \u2014 just like the ones I felt watching the show at the New Amsterdam Theatre, way back in 1997 when the musical first debuted.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cCircle of Life\u201d\n\u201cThey Live in You\u201d\n\u201cCan You Feel the Love Tonight\u201d\n\u201cHakuna Matata\u201d\n\u201cEndless Night / Shadowland\u201d\n\u201cCircle of Life\u201d (Reprise)\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nCAST\nL.

The warm-up was good, but once we started to record, a crazy intensity and energy spilled out into the room. They were fierce and fun and all of their solos were on fire. \n\nThe band makes amazing jazz music and mixes it with a fusion of other genres like Afrobeat, hip-hop and grime. The London-based band was supposed to play this Tiny Desk concert in 2020, but then, as bandleader and phenom drummer Femi Koleoso put it, \u201cthe world collapsed.\u201d Here it is now, rockin\u2019 hard with the highest level of musicianship and technique.\n\nBefore coming to NPR, Koleoso had just finished a world tour with the group Gorillaz. He met up with his bandmates in Washington, D.C., to play this concert and kick off promotion for the band\u2019s newly released sophomore album, Where I\u2019m Meant To Be. He explained on Instagram that he loves the album title because it's vague and specific at the same time, just like his band, a multifaceted complement of contrasting attributes. The first two songs in this set are from that new album while the last, \u201cChapter 7,\u201d is from the group\u2019s 2016 EP. Throughout the set, watch how keyboard player Joe Armon-Jones barely stays on his seat and hear how the audience couldn\u2019t keep quiet. After the concert, the spirit of the music lingered for a long time and the day ended with pictures, hugs and plenty of smiles. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cVictory Dance\u201d\n\u201cWelcome To My World\u201d\n\u201cChapter 7\u201d \n\nMUSICIANS\nFemi Koleoso: drums\nTJ Koleoso: bass\nJoe Armon-Jones: keys\nJames Mollison: saxophone\nIfe Ogunjobi: trumpet\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel \nAudio Assistant: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #ezracollective", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAzClkn3zYw", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
