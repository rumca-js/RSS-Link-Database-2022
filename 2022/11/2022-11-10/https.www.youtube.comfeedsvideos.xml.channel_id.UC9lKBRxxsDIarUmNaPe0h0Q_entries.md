How banks like Goldman Sachs ruin our economies. You might not know it, but investment banks are responsible for engineering basically every financial crisis in history. And one stands out over the rest: Goldman Sachs, who have been called the most evil bankers in the world.

From the Great Depression, to oil crises, the Dotcom bubble collapse, and so much more, Goldman Sachs has been there to funnel as much profit into its pockets as possible, make the situation worse, and engineer crises that end up damaging the lives of sometimes billions of people around the world.

This video shows just how deep the rabbit hole goes when it comes to showing the power and influence a bank like Goldman Sachs has over our lives. And how in many ways, we're just pawns in their big financial game.
