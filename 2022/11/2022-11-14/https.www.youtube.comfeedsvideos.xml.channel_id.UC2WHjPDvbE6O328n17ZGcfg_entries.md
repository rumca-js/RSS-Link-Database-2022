As you may know, I built a minimal developer portfolio website. Not just the GitHub profile page from last video. Or the Terminal Website from earlier this year. But a custom website with an intuitive, minimal design that gives a prospective client a quick look at you and your work as a developer. And now, I've decided to create a tutorial to teach you how to build this exact website for yourself.

The tools I used for this project include:
Vite - Build tool for the boilerplate and structure
JavaScript - Programming language
React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Tailwind - CSS framework
Hostinger - Web hosting platform
GitHub - Version control & CI/CD via Hostinger integration
