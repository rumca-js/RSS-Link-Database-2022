Not just the GitHub profile page from last video. Or the Terminal Website from earlier this year. But a custom website with an intuitive, minimal design that gives a prospective client a quick look at you and your work as a developer. And now, I've decided to create a tutorial to teach you how to build this exact website for yourself.\n\nThe tools I used for this project include:\nVite - Build tool for the boilerplate and structure\nJavaScript - Programming language\nReact - JavaScript library for building user interfaces\nTailwind - CSS framework\nHostinger - Web hosting platform\nGitHub - Version control & CI/CD via Hostinger integration\n\nRepo: https://github.com/ForrestKnight/minimal-portfolio\nWebsite: https://thehackershideout.com\n\n0:00 Overview & Tools\n2:14 Create project w/ Vite and Tailwind\n4:14 Setup boilerplate and connect files\n11:25 Intro\n16:43 Portfolio\n28:34 Timeline\n39:04 Contact\n45:20 Footer\n46:42 Title\n49:01 Dark mode\n58:25 GitHub, Hostinger, and Actions\n1:07:12 Thanks for Watching!!\n\nThis video is sponsored by Hostinger.\n\n------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forrestpknight\n \n\ud83d\udcd3 Learning Resources: \nMy Favorite Machine Learning Course:  https://imp.i384100.net/YgYEBJ\nOpen Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/open-source-forrest\nPython Open Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/python-open-source\nUdacity to Learn Any Coding Skill: http://bit.ly/udacity-forrest\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb My Coding Gear:\nMy NAS Server: https://amzn.to/3brqO7b\nMy Hard Drives: https://amzn.to/3aKetMi\nMy Main Monitor: https://amzn.to/3siQfPa\nMy Second Monitor: https://amzn.to/3keHT84\nMy Standing Desk: https://amzn.to/3boAcbC\nMy PC Build:  https://bit.ly/my-coding-gear\nMy AI GPU: https://amzn.to/3uvmUmz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0pkpcD8Ms4", "date_published": "2022-11-14 14:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
