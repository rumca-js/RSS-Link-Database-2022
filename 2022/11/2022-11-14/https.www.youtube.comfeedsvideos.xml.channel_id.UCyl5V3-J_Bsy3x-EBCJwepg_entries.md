We did it, y'all! We hit 1 MILLION subscribers thanks to all of you! We wanted to express our utmost gratitude, so we shot this video thanking you from the depths of our heart. We never could have done this without your love, support, and most importantly your money. Thank you for allowing us to spread right-wing misinformation under the guise of satire.
