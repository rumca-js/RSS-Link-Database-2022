"CCP, step down, CCP, step down, CCP step down..."
This is by far the bravest slogan ever uttered by the Chinese. The people in this country are struggling with the harsh restrictions of the Chinese Communist Party CCP, which has led to a flurry of protests. The victories, big or small, have been inspiring. This video has recently become an internet sensation in the Chinese community. The man wearing a backpack ranted about the Communist Party's anti-epidemic policies in front of a neighborhood in Chongqing, and the crowd of onlookers responded so enthusiastically that when he was forcibly taken by police, people bravely rescued him.
