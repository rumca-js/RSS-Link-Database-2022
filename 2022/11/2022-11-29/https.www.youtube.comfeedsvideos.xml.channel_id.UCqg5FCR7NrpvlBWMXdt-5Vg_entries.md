This week on Breakout we're taking about video game adaptions in media, along with a discussion about the expectations of live service AAA games which have more often than not recently had really rough launches. 

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
