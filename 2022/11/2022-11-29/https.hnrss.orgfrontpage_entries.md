<p>I started at a mid-cap household name company at the start of the pandemic and don't see myself leaving of my own accord until I retire for a few reasons:<p>1. Work is fully remote<p>2. We have excellent work / life balance<p>3. Company's stock has weathered this years storm<p>4. Interviewing is a horror show best avoided, besides...<p>5. Job market is weakening with no recovery in sight<p>6. I'm in my early 40s<p>7. Startup success (which I've had previously as an early employee) is going to be rare in the coming years</p>

## Show HN: SinglePage – Quickly and anonymously publish a page to the web

<p>Creating a basic webpage has become way too complicated and expensive. Often there are those times when you just want to share your thoughts with the world but don't want the overhead and complexities that come with maintaining a website. Sometimes, you have an interesting thought piece, an education article, or just a quick and simple bio page that doesn't need the heavy hand of a WordPress blog or Medium post. That's where Single Page comes in. Publish a single page instantly to the web with no fuss.<p>I was laid off three weeks ago from Twitter and I decided to work through a couple of my projects and this was one of them. I've tried blogs over the years, Medium didn't feel right but yet I wanted to quickly post pages online and couldn't find an easy way to do it. So I created it.<p>Feedback appreciated!</p>
