USB has never been easy to understand, and USB4 is no exception. How compatible is it with Thunderbolt 3? What about Thunderbolt 4? What cables can and can’t be used? Is a USB4 cable interchangeable with a Thunderbolt 4 cable?

Part 1 of Switching to Intel Arc ended up being almost entirely hardware-related, and Luke has a lot of complaints on the software side of things only one week into the 30-day challenge. Intel usually makes software that works, just how bad could Arc Control be?
