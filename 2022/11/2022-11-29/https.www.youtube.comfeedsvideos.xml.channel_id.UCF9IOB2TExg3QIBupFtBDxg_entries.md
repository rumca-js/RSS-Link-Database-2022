$75 gift card for getting vaccinated against COVID-19,

through Dec. 31st  

Adults and children alike,

first dose, second dose, or booster shots.

Endemic common human coronaviruses

About 20% of colds

https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/coronavirus-information/about-the-virus/how-are-the-coronaviruses-that-cause-the-common-cold-different-from-the-covid-19-virus

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html

Types 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 

usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, 

like the common cold. 

runny nose
sore throat
headache
fever
cough

general feeling of being unwell

Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, 

such as pneumonia or bronchitis. 

This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease, 

weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults.

Cross-reactive memory T cells associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 contacts

Cross-reactive immune responses

Common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2

The frequency of baseline cross-reactive T cells,

is correlated with the infection outcome following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 

and we observe significantly higher frequencies of cross-reactive memory T cell responses in PCR-negative contacts. 

Here we assess 52 COVID-19 household contacts

Studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells

(Lymphocytes as opposed to neutrophils)

T cells specific for spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and ORF1 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes,

(Open Reading Frame, about a tenth of the viral genome)

These T cells cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses. 

We observe higher frequencies of cross-reactivity

Memory T cells cross reacted with nucleocapsid-specific antigens significantly

Memory T cells did not seem to cross react with pre-existing spike-cross-reactive T cells

Our results are thus consistent with pre-existing non-spike cross-reactive memory T cells protecting SARS-CoV-2-na√Øve contacts from infection, 

thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in second-generation vaccines.

China

66% per cent of over-80s are double vaccinated

68% per cent of over-60s have been boosted

1.3 to 2.1 million lives at risk

November up to 26th 

Cases  31,709 + 35,183 + 39,791

(only a few imported cases)

Of the 39,791 cases

3,709 were symptomatic

36,082 were asymptomatic

(National Health Commission)

Deaths, + 1 = 5,233

More data still required on the nature of the excess deaths

UK Zoe data

The report and the data files 

https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/covid-public-data

1.48% in England (1 in 65 people)

1.49% in Wales (1 in 65 people) 

1.86% in Northern Ireland (1 in 55 people) 

1.59% in Scotland (1 in 65 people)

Less than 4 in 10 patients in hospital in England with COVID-19 in October 2022 were being treated primarily for COVID-19

Deaths and excess deaths

Week ending 18 November 2022

471 deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK

Deaths involving COVID-19 accounted for 3.6% of all deaths in the UK

(a fall from 4.4% in the previous week)

A total of 13,236 deaths were registered in the UK

7.7% above the five-year average

(941 excess deaths)

The rate of death involving COVID-19 was higher for those with obesity than those without obesity

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

Those who reported symptoms with their first infection were less likely to be reinfected

2.1 million people in the UK were experiencing self-reported long COVID as of 1 October 2022
