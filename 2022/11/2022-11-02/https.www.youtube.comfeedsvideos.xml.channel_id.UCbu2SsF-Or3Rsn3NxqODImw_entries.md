God of War Ragnarok reviews are here, a tease at a second Warzone 2.0 map, and Modern Warfare II gets its first post launch patch. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

Ragnarok Reviews are here, and it sounds like the game Ragnarocks. 

Look. I’m sorry. I tried to write this script and not make that joke, but I just couldn’t do it. I promise it’s the only one.

On Metacritic, which, full disclosure, is a sister site to GameSpot, the game at the time of recording has a 94 avg based on 112 reviews. That is the exact same score its 2018 predecessor has on the site as well based on 118 reviews.

Our own review from Tamoor Hussain states, “God of War Ragnarok is a lavish production with pristine visuals, jaw-dropping scale, crunchy combat that is as satisfying as it is brutal, and a world that begs to have its every corner and crevice explored.” Hussain’s singular gripe with the game stems from elements of its combat, noting, “ the mechanics can struggle under the pressure of the increased speed and aggression [as the game progresses]”

Leon Hurley at Games Radar has some light criticism of the game’s first half, saying, “I found God of War Ragnarok an oddly split experience overall. There's a light start that feels padded – still good but missing depth – which leads into a weighty finish that's every bit the equal of its predecessor.”

Game Informer’s Kyle Hilliard, who used to be GameSpot’s Kyle Hilliard — they won him over by saying he could review Ragnarok, I’m sure — writes, “God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn't broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn't particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation.”

Not too Badnarok.

Ragnarök is coming, and Kratos and Atreus will soon find themselves facing the end of the world itself. Yet, as the great battle with the most dangerous of Aesir approaches, let’s look at the history of behind the Norse apocalypse, Ragnarok itself, to see what that might mean for God of War Ragnarok.

Kratos and Atreus are back! And they’re ready to face the end of the world together, or at least I hope they are. Here’s everything you need to know about God of War Ragnarok.
#Gaming #GodofWarRagnarok #GameSpot

God of War Ragnarok takes place a few years after the events of God of War 2018. According to Sony, Atreus is desperately curious and “like most young people, he wants to understand who he is more than anything. In this case, he wants to understand who he could be. The mystery of Loki's role in the upcoming conflict is something that Atreus cannot let go of.”

That conflict is the looming threat of Ragnarok, a prophesied battle that will end the world and Sony continued by saying “Atreus also doesn't want to stand by and do nothing while conflict consumes the Nine Realms.

s for Kratos, Sony says he is intent on helping to spare Atreus from the "bloody lessons he learned from his conflict with gods."

If you’ve never played the games that came before 2018’s release then let me just say, this man’s hands get VERY dirty. We have a complete God of War timeline video available to watch if you need a refresher. For now, back to Ragnarok. 

In order to find the answers they seek, Kratos and Atreus will journey to each of the Nine Realms facing off against a variety of Norse gods and monsters while exploring stunning mythical landscapes. 

Ragnarok will wrap up this Norse chapter of the franchise, as Sony Santa Monica wanted to avoid having this portion of the story from getting too unwieldy.

PSVR 2 gets a massive price tag, Modern Warfare 2 runs into more issues, and It Takes Two developer teases the team’s next game. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

PSVR 2 gets a massive price tag, Modern Warfare 2 runs into more issues, and It Takes Two developer teases the team’s next game. All this on today’s GameSpot News.

Sony has revealed the launch date and price of the upcoming PSVR 2. The good news is the device is releasing very soon. The bad news is that it will cost you more than a PS5.

On February 22 2023, the PSVR 2 will release for $550, which is $50 more than the PS5 with a disk drive and $150 more than the digital only PS5. Sony will also sell a Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle that comes with the system and the game for $600, while the PSVR 2 Sense controller charging station will be offered on its own for $50.

PSVR 2 will be available to preorder starting November 15 from Sony's online store at direct.playstation.com for shoppers in the US, UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Preorder registration opens today, November 2.

In addition to the release date and pricing announcement, Sony revealed a bunch more games you’ll be able to play on the system at launch.

In the vein of its previous VR title Until Dawn: Rush of Blood that came out for the first PS VR, developer Supermassive will be releasing a similar experience under its more recent Dark Pictures banner; a horror game subtitled Switchback VR that, like Rush of Blood, is a first person shooter on a rollercoaster.

In addition, shooter franchise Crossfire is coming to the device with Sierra Squad, the popular VR title Pistol Whip is being ported over, and the Cities series is getting a VR installment. For more info on all the titles announced, head to the link in the description.

On the PC side of gaming life, a Steam feature that was available at Modern Warfare 2’s launch has since been disabled. 

For the unfamiliar, family sharing is a Steam feature that lets family and friends have access to games on your account. Any account can share a game with up to five other accounts, but there are some restrictions. The digital copy is essentially shared between accounts, so two players cannot play at the same time on different PCs. The feature is activated at the discretion of the game publisher and there is an option to turn it off or on in the Steam backend.

While the game launched with this enabled, a listing on SteamDB states the feature was turned off on Halloween, preventing some players who had access to the game from playing further.

Activision has yet to make an official comment, but users have speculated that family sharing can enable cheaters to avoid bans. Regardless, members of the Call of Duty community are generally unhappy with the change, citing the high price tag of the game and the desire to let other members of their household or family play without buying a second copy.

Sonic is back with a bold new direction in Sonic Frontiers. Sonic Frontiers takes cues from modern open world games to create something both familiar and all new for Sonic. So, here is everything you need to know about Sonic Frontiers.
#Gaming #SonicFrontiers #GameSpot

Brand new to Sonic with Sonic Frontiers is a skill tree. Fallen enemies now drop skill pieces Sonic can collect and use to upgrade his skills. Not only that, but Sonic will be able to upgrade his stats by collecting red seeds of power and blue seeds of defense. These seeds can be found by completing puzzles and sidequests in the open zones. These puzzles can also unlock new areas of the map.

Combat is another new feature to Sonic Frontiers. While Sonic will maintain his classic skill of a homing attack, he’ll also have a drop dash and stomp attack, be able to slide at any point, and boost his speed on ground or mid-air. Not only that, but Sonic can now attack with his fists in melee combat, perform combos, and use the brand new skill tree to level up these skills.

Cyloop sees you run in a circle around an enemy while activating this ability in order to break enemy’s shields and guards, then have an opening to get in attacks. Cyloop can also be used to quickly collect rings after getting hit by an enemy.

Sonic can also now both parry enemy attacks and dodge. Parrying allows Sonic to use this window to counter-attack. Meanwhile, dodging at the right time briefly slows down the time allowing Sonic to get in more attacks.

Included in Sonic’s new skillset is a meter that will fill up during combos, and when high enough, allows Sonic to perform a Phantom Rush - which boosts Sonic’s attack power until the meter drops back to 0.
