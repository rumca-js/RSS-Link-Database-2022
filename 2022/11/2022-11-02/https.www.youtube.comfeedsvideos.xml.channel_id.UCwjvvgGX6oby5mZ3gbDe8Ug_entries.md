Foxconn Zhengzhou is one of Apple Inc.'s largest foundries in Asia, with a peak workforce of 300,000 employees at one point. From Oct. 29th to 30th, a large number of employees broke out of the plant after a fierce clash between the employees and the anti-epidemic workers. Some employees told overseas Chinese media that they witnessed batches of workers being hauled away from the dorm and quarantined. Itâ€™s exposed that abnormalities are found in the nucleic acid test results of nearly 20,000 people who are quarantined in an Evergrande's rotten-tail building. Once workers are placed in quarantine, they are left unattended, without medical care or food.
All these have scared the remaining workers. First, they are still afraid that they will be dragged away for quarantine; second, they are also afraid that the number of positive cases in Foxconn factories will continue to increase, and that eventually they will be infected.
