In the case of British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, it took about three years. Granted, the pandemic got in the way, but ever since his 2018 breakthrough performance at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, he\u2019s been -- needless to say -- in demand. Nearly 2 billion people worldwide saw his royal performance on television. \n\nAt the Tiny Desk, Kanneh-Mason played for only a handful of NPR staffers, and the performance felt like a direct communication from his luminous cello (built in 1700) to our heartstrings. It was especially true in Kanneh-Mason\u2019s own arrangement of \u201cMyfanwy,\u201d the mournful Welsh folk song the cellist first heard from his grandmother. Accompanying himself with left hand pizzicato, Kanneh-Mason makes his instrument sing like a sad old Welshman with a tear in his eye. \n\nAside from his expressive playing, Kanneh-Mason excels at arranging pop songs for his instrument. \u201cNo Woman, No Cry,\u201d one of his calling cards, explores the tender and bittersweet side of the Bob Marley classic.  \n\nStill only 23, Kanneh-Mason\u2019s stature commands the attention of composers. Last year, the fine young Brit Edmund Finnis wrote a set of solo preludes for Kanneh-Mason. The music reveals the cello\u2019s many voices, from growling urgency to supple soliloquy to full-throated cry. \n\nWhile we can\u2019t guarantee 2 billion views on our platforms, those who do watch this Tiny Desk performance will witness a rising young star who, whether he knows it or not, represents nothing less than the future of classical music.\n\nSET LIST\nBob Marley: \u201cNo Woman, No Cry\u201d (arr.
