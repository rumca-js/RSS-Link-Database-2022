[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Better Mastodon Aliases", "description": "<p><span>\n\nWhen I </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/trying-mastodon\">joined Mastodon</a> I was\n\n\n<code>@jefftk@schelling.pt</code>.  A few days ago that server had an\nincident and I moved to \n\n<code><a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu\">mastodon.mit.edu</a></code>, becoming\n\n\n<code>@jefftk@mastodon.mit.edu</code>.  This got me thinking about a\nwart in the current Mastodon design: while you can normally move\nfollowers with you if you switch instances, this requires the\ncooperation of the instance you're leaving.  In this case that\ninstance couldn't cooperate because its domain name had expired, but I\ncould also imagine someone having a falling out with their local\nadmins and getting kicked off in a way that precluded transfer.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIdeally this would be like email: I send and receive email as\n<code>jeff@jefftk.com</code>.  The actual server I use is\n<code>gmail.com</code>, but the people I interact with don't need to\nknow that.  If I ever want to move to a different email server I don't\nneed Gmail's permission and I don't need to tell my contacts; I can do\nit entirely on my end.  Similarly <code>jefftk.com</code> currently\npoints to a Contabo VPS, but if I had an issue with them I could move\nanywhere just by adjusting my domain settings.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nCurrent Mastodon is partway there: I\ncan give out <code>@jeff@jefftk.com</code>, which uses a <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/.well-known/webfinger\">webfinger file</a>\n(thanks, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02b41Atb2K5fkRu7a4euHz7DCAJEkgNdMsdC57PD3NrTPU45YV7AxJWE96Wn1HJbHul?comment_id=584624750086568\">Chris</a>)\nto redirect <code>@[anything]@jefftk.com</code> to\n<code>@jefftk@mastodon.mit.edu</code>.  But then the original address\nis forgotten, and it only records that they're following my\n<code>mastodon.mit.edu</code> account.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne way for this to work would be that when following someone you\nstore both their current account name and a canonical account name.\nAlmost everything would use the former, but once a day in your\ninstance would check whether the canonical account still pointed to\nthe same place and adjust if necessary.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(For more discussion along these lines see Issue <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/3796#issuecomment-451274118%22\">3796</a>.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02T4BvzKwfye7TiHi7FrR5VdzyfY18mBwegMQamZ9SnPGbfnJRkVA9kqHHbgz64ty5l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109347720341123283\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/better-mastodon-aliases", "date_published": "2022-11-15 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
