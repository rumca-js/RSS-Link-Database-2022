00:00 Intro
00:16 Apology
00:56 Apple sued for deceiving users w/ privacy settings
01:12 Every tap made in the app store in iOS 14.6 sent to Apple
01:27 Which apps viewed with timestamps & duration sent to Apple
01:40 iPhones don't allow you to install apps ANY OTHER WAY!!
02:06 Why should app viewing history be sent to Apple?
02:16 Switching personalization off did NOT reduce amount of data app sent!
02:42 Stocks & news app sends stocks watched, news read to Apple 
03:06 iOS behaves worse than Google Chrome
03:40 Apple's definition of privacy is manipulative & dystopian 
04:25 iOS still sends less data than stock android
05:18 Shilling of GrapheneOS (not sponsored, not paid to, it just kicks ass)
06:06 The illusion of choice with the mobile duopoly
06:40 Privacy is not by default without modification 
07:21 Every time I say something nice about Apple, I get proven wrong :(
08:27 - THE UNBLOCKABLE SPONSOR

## Elon Musk is a thin skinned CEO.

00:00 Intro
00:20 How I use twitter
00:49 Elon Musk tweet
01:00 What is an appropriate public response?
01:09 You can't talk to the boss like that!!
01:19 Who sets the work culture?
01:27 The three degrees of public
01:40 An example with my own staff
02:07 Setting work culture happens at the top
03:10 Employee response - very technically relevant & literate
03:44 SURPRISE DGG? b
04:00 This employee wants to make things better
04:50 FIRED!
05:00 What would you do, Louis??
06:03 Addressing the stans
06:12 The stan rule
06:20 You can't criticize Musk unless you have his money or businesses. 
06:49 Billionaires are mortal, and human
07:14 Elon's own words, he is overworked and burning out
07:43 I'd screw up doing 100 hours of work a week as well
08:22 If this crashes and burns, I'll still be happy. twitter sucks.
