Rosa Linn is well on her way to becoming Armenia's first global music artist and its first woman music producer. Selected to represent Armenia at the Eurovision Song Contest in May 2022, Rosa Linn’s song “Snap” quickly became a fan favorite, taking on a viral life of its own with millions of streams on Spotify and millions of fan remixes and tributes on TikTok.

Now poised to go on tour with Ed Sheeran, Rosa Linn connected with The Current Morning Show host Jill Riley to talk about the sudden rise to fame, the people she’s met along the way, and the importance of being authentic no matter what.
