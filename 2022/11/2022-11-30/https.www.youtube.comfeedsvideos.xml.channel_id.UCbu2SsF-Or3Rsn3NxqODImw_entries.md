Still not sure what to ask Santa for? Well lucky for you this December is a little busier than normal, so we’ve got some great ideas for your wish list. Here are 10 of the biggest games coming out in December 2022.
#TheCallistoProtocol #MarvelsMidnightSuns #GameSpot

The Callisto Protocol is a new original survival-horror game set on Callisto--a moon of Jupiter. More specifically, it's set in a prison called Black Iron located on Callisto in 2320, with protagonist Jacob Lee finding himself trapped as mutating humans begin taking over and murdering other inmates. If dead things in space sound familiar, that's because The Callisto Protocol is being developed by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield’s new company, Striking Distance Studios.

Marvel's Midnight Suns is the next game from developer Firaxis Games, the studio behind Civilization and the past three XCOM games. Though it has tactical strategy elements, Marvel's Midnight Suns is far from a superhero reskin of XCOM. Instead of set abilities, your heroes will each have a deck of ability cards that get shuffled together when you bring three of them into combat together. Those cards range from basic attacks to special skills, allowing you to buff other players or toss enemies around the battlefield. The cards can also be customized with variations to suit your playstyle.

Need for Speed has a number of games about street racing, but Need for Speed Unbound might just be one of the most distinct entries in the long-running series, thanks to its cel-shaded visuals that make it look like a high-speed anime series. In the story players will attempt to win The Grand, the ultimate street racing challenge in Lakeshore, collecting cars and using them as a canvas to show off their personal style on the streets.

Watch the Game Awards and win a free Steam Deck, Nintnedo address issues with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and Lego Star Wars the Skywalker Saga is coming to Game Pass.

Don’t have a Steam Deck yet? No worries. Valve might give you one for free!

On December 8, during the Game Awards, the maker of the Steam Deck Valve will be giving away the most expensive version of the Steam Deck, with 512GB, every minute to viewers of the livestream event.

If you want to be one of those lucky viewers, all you’ll need to do is head to the link we’ve attached in the description, sign into Steam, and then hit register now. Then, on December 8th, you must watch the Game Awards livestream via Steam— yes, Steam does livestreaming if you didn’t know— to be in with a chance of winning one.

Considering that last year, the length of the Game Awards rivaled the runtime of one of the Lord of the Rings movies, Valve is set to give away hundreds of devices.

And even if you have a Steam Deck already, you should register anyway because A) who doesn’t need a second Steam Deck? and B) everyone who registers gets a very cute Steam Pal digital sticker.

Of course you’ll be wanting to pick up a Steam Deck to replace your Switch because the technical issues of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have pushed you to the brink. But don’t retire that nearly 6 year old handheld just yet, because in an extremely rare acknowledgement by Nintendo, it seems that the game might actually be getting some fixes.

The game just got its first patch since launch, and will make some additions as well as address some issues. Ranked battling is coming to the game’s battle stadium, and there have been some bug fixes, including a bug where the music during the game’s Elite Four confrontations wouldn’t play correctly.

As for what the additional bug fixes are, who knows what exactly what has been mended in this patch, but some of the biggest ones include massive frame rate drops, pop in at extremely close distances, invisible legendaries, and clipping through environments, but it sounds like some, if not all of these problems, will be addressed.

In addition to the patch notes, Nintendo stated that, “We are aware that players may encounter issues that affect the games' performance. Our goal is always to give players a positive experience with our games, and we apologize for the inconvenience. We take the feedback from players seriously and are working on improvements to the games."

A statement like this is almost unheard of from the gaming giant. Considering its rarity, as well as the fact that Scarlet and Violet have been Nintendo’s fastest selling games ever, the breadth of issues, as well as the volume of players pointing them out, must be immense.

CD Projekt Red reveals whats next for Cyberpunk, Monster Hunter Rise is coming to more consoles, and new details on Bethesda's Indiana Jones game.
#Gaming #Cyberpunk2077 #CDProjektRed 

Development of the sequel to CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077 will begin in 2023 with pre-production once the team has wrapped and shipped the original game’s upcoming DLC, Phantom Liberty.

Adam Kiciski, president and joint CEO of CD Projekt Red, says in its recent earnings report that the team is finishing up development of the expansion currently, of which almost 350 people are working on.

Thanks to the Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the game has had a second wind. As previously reported, Cyberpunk 2077 had more than a million people log in and, as of September 21, remained one of the top 10 most-played games on Steam.

That earnings report, which covered the third quarter of business for CD Projekt (July - September of this year), revealed that this was its best third quarter since its founding in the ‘90s.

The company brought in $54.2 million in revenue thanks to strong sales of Cyberpunk 2077, which the company will looking to replicate in its sequel.

It seems like the dark days of the game’s launch are far behind in the rearview mirror for gamers.

2023 won’t just be the start of pre-production for the next Cyberpunk, but may also bring a beloved entry in a beloved franchise to consoles. Capcom apparently plans to bring Monster Hunter Rise to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One next year.

Insider Gaming reported that the game will release January 20 on those platforms, as well as become available on Game Pass, followed by its expansion Sunbreak later in the spring. Capcom will supposedly unveil these plans at The Game Awards on December 8.

Monster Hunter Rise originally released in March 2021 for Nintendo Switch, with the game now on PC too.

What’s interesting about the news of it launching on console with Game Pass is that Xbox is supposedly working on its own Monster Hunter-like release according to a report from earlier this year.

In January, Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb revealed that the title is codenamed Project Suerte, and is under development at Certain Affinity, a studio that has mainly done work supporting other games, including Xbox’s own Halo franchise, of which Certain Affinity is also rumored to be developing a battle royale game for its latest entry Halo Infinite.
