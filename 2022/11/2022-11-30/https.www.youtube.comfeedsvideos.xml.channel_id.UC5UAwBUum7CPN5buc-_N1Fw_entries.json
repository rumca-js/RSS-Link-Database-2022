It uses SSL, and the port is 993.\nThe user is your icloud address, and for the password, you'll need to generate an app specific password.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT204397\n\nAs per sending email, the server is smtp.mail.me.com, SSL is needed, and the port is 587. The address and password are the same that you entered for email reception.\n\nFor contacts and calendars, the parameters to enter are the following:\nAs the calendar address, enter https://caldav.icloud.com/ . Your user name is your icloud address, and your password is the app password you generated earlier.\nSame goes for contacts, except the address to enter is https://contacts.icloud.com/.\n\nYou can access Notes and Reminders through the web portal. They only have the basic features. iWork apps, like Numbers, pages and Keynote are also all accessible.\n\nNow for photos, the web interface is serviceable, you get your albums, a list of pictures, you can upload photos manually and have them show up on all your other devices, but you won't be able to edit them from here.\n\nThere is no auto upload app that will let you send pictures from your desktop to your icloud photo library either, you'll have to do manual uploads.\n\nThere's a command line utility called icloud photos downloader:\n\nhttps://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader\n\nAs per files stored in iCloud drive, this one will also only be accessible through the web interface, you can't mount it as external storage or auto sync files to a Linux desktop, which kinda sucks.\n\nIf you use Apple Music, there's a fantastic Linux desktop client, called Cider.\nYou can install it from flathub,or as a snap, a debian package, and an appimage, as well as from the AUR.\n\nThere is simply no way to access your imessages on Linux. No web interface, no app, no third party client. it's a closed source program and protocol, and so unless Apple decides to offer a web interface or to open the protocol, you'll have to keep using your smartphone or tablet to answer these.\n\n## Connecting devices\n\nWhat if you want to plug in a device and grab its contents on Linux, though? Well, that's supported. By default, when plugging in your iphone or ipad, it will show up as a camera device, provided you accept that access on the popup that appears on your device. It will show up with a DCIM folder.\n\nIt will be mounted as read-only, so you can't transfer files to it. \n\nYou can do that using iFuse: https://www.hukot.net/community/en/tutorials/mount-iphone-in-debian-ubuntu-linux\n\nKDE Connect lets you sync stuff between a phone or tablet, and a linux desktop. It should be installed by default on KDE desktops, and on GNOME, you can install the GSConnect extension. Don't forget to reboot your computer afterwards, it never worked right after install for me. \n\nOn iOS, you can share the contents of the clipboard, send photos or videos, send regular files, use the device as a slideshow remote, run commands, or use it as a virtual touchpad. You can also send files to your iDevice, and they'll show up in the Files app, in local files, in the KDE Connect folder.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWY4D3Gkc3o", "date_published": "2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
