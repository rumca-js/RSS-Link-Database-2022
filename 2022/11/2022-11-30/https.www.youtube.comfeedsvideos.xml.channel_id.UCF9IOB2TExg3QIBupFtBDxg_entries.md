Adults and children alike,

first dose, second dose, or booster shots.

Endemic common human coronaviruses

About 20% of colds

https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/coronavirus-information/about-the-virus/how-are-the-coronaviruses-that-cause-the-common-cold-different-from-the-covid-19-virus

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html

Types 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 

usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, 

like the common cold. 

runny nose
sore throat
headache
fever
cough

general feeling of being unwell

Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, 

such as pneumonia or bronchitis. 

This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease, 

weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults.

Cross-reactive memory T cells associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 contacts

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27674-x

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220111/common-cold-covid-protection

Cross-reactive immune responses

Common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2

The frequency of baseline cross-reactive T cells,

is correlated with the infection outcome following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 

and we observe significantly higher frequencies of cross-reactive memory T cell responses in PCR-negative contacts. 

Here we assess 52 COVID-19 household contacts

Studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells

(Lymphocytes as opposed to neutrophils)

T cells specific for spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and ORF1 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes,

(Open Reading Frame, about a tenth of the viral genome)

These T cells cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses. 

We observe higher frequencies of cross-reactivity

Memory T cells cross reacted with nucleocapsid-specific antigens significantly

Memory T cells did not seem to cross react with pre-existing spike-cross-reactive T cells

Our results are thus consistent with pre-existing non-spike cross-reactive memory T cells protecting SARS-CoV-2-naïve contacts from infection, 

thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in second-generation vaccines.

66% per cent of over-80s are double vaccinated

68% per cent of over-60s have been boosted
