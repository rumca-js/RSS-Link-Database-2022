I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of San Francisco 1940s, several shots of a neighborhood in Chinatown, Sacramento and Grant Avenue in San Francisco, and some shots of the shipyards and pier in SF , Overall shots of the back and front, showing the various piers, ships and deck.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design  only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
