I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Wonderful San franscisco and Los Angeles1940s, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, We start with a still shot in downtown San Francisco, a lot of people walking in the street, cars and streetcars, we have a long drive in the middle of the night in downtown San Francisco and Los angeles

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
