Covid infection did not increase incidence of post-covid myocarditis or pericarditis.

The Incidence of Myocarditis and Pericarditis in Post COVID-19 Unvaccinated Patients-A Large Population-Based Study

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm

Myocarditis and pericarditis, post-acute cardiac sequelae of COVID-19 infection, 

arising from adaptive immune responses. 

? incidence

Retrospective cohort study

Study group, had infection

N = 196,992 adults after COVID-19 infection

(Clalit Health Services)

March 2020 to January 2021

Inpatient myocarditis and pericarditis diagnoses,

from day 10 after positive PCR

Israeli vaccination program initiated on 20 December 2020

Follow-up was censored on 28 February 2021

Control cohort, never infected

N = 590,976 adults,

with at least one negative PCR and no positive PCR

(age- and sex-matched)

Calculated backward from 15 December 2020

Results

Post-COVID-19 group

Nine post-COVID-19 patients developed myocarditis (0.0046%)

Eleven diagnosed with pericarditis (0.0056%)

Control group, never covid infected

27 developed myocarditis (0.0046%) P = 1

52 developed pericarditis (0.0088%) P = 0.17


Adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]

Myocarditis, male (aHR 4.42) regardless of previous COVID-19 infection

Pericarditis, (aHR 1.93)

Peripheral vascular disease, (aHR 4.20)

Follow up

Median, 4.1 months

Covid cohort, 700,040 person-months

Non covid cohort, 2,100,077 person-months 

Conclusions

Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with myocarditis (aHR 1.08)

Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with pericarditis (aHR 0.53)

We did not observe an increased incidence of neither pericarditis nor myocarditis in adult patients recovering from COVID-19 infection.



Our data suggest that there is no increase in the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in COVID-19 recovered patients,

compared to uninfected matched controls.
