Now, my \u201cWhy I Code for 4 Hours\u201d video touches on the broader spectrum of how I am able improve efficiency in life that drips into my work as a software developer. This video is to get into the nitty-gritty details that are specific to developers, like taking time to master your IDE, refactoring your code, not over-engineering your solutions or reinventing the wheel, having a set of coding standards and style guidelines that you stick by, or even something as simple as learning keyboard shortcuts. Now, many of these things may take some time to accomplish up-front, but you have to weigh the time savings. You\u2019ll find the long-term gain heavily outweighs the short-term loss.\nThis is what I implore you to do. Become an efficient programmer by following the things laid out in this video. You won\u2019t be able to implement everything all at once. But pick one or two and start. Then pick up another few when you feel confident you\u2019ve accomplished and can maintain the prior two. A comment with something you learned here today that maybe you\u2019ll start implementing tomorrow will be greatly appreciated.
