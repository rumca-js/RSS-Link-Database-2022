Australia, Key statistics
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/latest-release
In 2022, there were 111,008 deaths that occurred by 31 July,

and were registered by 30 September, which is 16,375 

(17.3%) more than the historical average.

In July there were 17,936 deaths, 

2,503 (16.2%) above the historical average.

There were 300 (22.5%) fewer deaths due to COVID-19 in August than July.

Since the pandemic began

Over 30,000 excess deaths involving heart disease

(average over 230 additional deaths a week)

Heart disease is among the most prominent diseases involved in the high numbers of excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. 

While Covid-19 infection was likely a significant factor

Covid infections no longer a driving force

Focusing on COVID-19 deaths alone without examining total excess deaths

—that is, deaths due to non-COVID-19 causes as well as to COVID-19
—may underestimate the true impact of the pandemic
