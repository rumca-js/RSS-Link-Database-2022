Popular television shows have portrayed death investigators as high-tech sleuths wielding the most sophisticated tools of 21st century science. A 2011 investigation by FRONTLINE, ProPublica and NPR found a very different reality: A dysfunctional system with few standards and little oversight. In state after state, reporters found autopsies conducted by doctors who lacked certification and training, an increasing number of Americans going to the grave without being examined at all – and vulnerable people suffering most from the country’s system of death investigation.
