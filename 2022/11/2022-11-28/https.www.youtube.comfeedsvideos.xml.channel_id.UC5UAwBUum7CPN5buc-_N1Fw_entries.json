Click on the \"View\" menu, then \"User interface\". By default, it's the standard menubar and toolbar combo, but if you click on \"tabbed\", you'll see that you can now use a ribbon interface, just like what Microsoft Office uses. \n\nNext, we'll look at the icons. From the tabbed interface, click the main menu, in the top right corner, and select \"Options\". Then click the \"View\" menu, and in the \"Theme\" drop down menu, you'll have plenty of options.\n\nYou can also reorder any of the icons from any of the tabs of the ribbon. CLick the main menu again, and then \"customize\". Then click the \"Notebookbar\" tab. here, yu'll see the \"target\" dropdown menu that lets you select which tab you want to change.\n\nTo install Microsoft fonts, you generally have a package in your distro's repositories, provided you enabled the non free software ones. the package is generally called ttf-mscorefonts or ttf-mscorefonts installer. On Ubuntu or Ubuntu based distros, for example, open a terminal, and run\n\nsudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nIf you're using an arch based distro, you can find it in your graphical package manager through the AUR. For Fedora, I left a link in the description of the video.\n\nhttps://www.linuxcapable.com/install-microsoft-fonts-on-fedora-linux/\n\nIf you want to use these fonts by default, you can configure that as well. Click the main menu, then Options. Then, go to the name of the app you're using, here it's LibreOffice Writer, and select the \"basic fonts\" tab.\n\nYou'll want to enable all compatibility features. To do that, open the main menu, then Options. In the Load Save tab, click on Microsoft Office, and make sure all the checkboxes are ticked.\n\nNext, in the LibreOffice Writer tab, and the Compatibility tab, tick the \"Reorganize form menu to have it MS compatible\" checkbox. Also tick the \"Word compatible trailing blanks\" checkmark.\n\nNext, if you interact with MS Office users a lot, you'll want to send them documents using the Office formats. Click on the \"general\" tab of the Load / Save panel, and in \"Always save as\", select Word 2007-365 (docx). Then in the document type dropdown, select spreadsheet, and change the \"always save as\" field to Excel 2007-365 xlsx, and repeat that step for Presentations and the pptx format.\n\nTo import styles and templates, click the \"File\" tab in Writer, and then \"Templates\". There, click the \"Manage\" button, in the top right corner, and click \"Import\". There, you can select \"templates\", \"presentations\", or \"styles\".\n\nLibreOffice lets you install extensions to add features to the suite. You can head over to extensions.libreoffice.org to view a full list.\n\nTo install extensions, download them from the extensions portal, and you'll get a .oxt file. Then, in LibreOffice, click the \"Extensions\" tab, then the \"extensions\" menu, and \"Extension manager\". Click the \"Add\" button, and go find your oxt file to import it.\n\nAfter that, these extensions will all display their commands in the \"Extensions\" tab.\n\nhttps://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Feature_Comparison:_LibreOffice_-_Microsoft_Office\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s87xFvfeg7Y&t=3s", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0che2Az9hw", "date_published": "2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
