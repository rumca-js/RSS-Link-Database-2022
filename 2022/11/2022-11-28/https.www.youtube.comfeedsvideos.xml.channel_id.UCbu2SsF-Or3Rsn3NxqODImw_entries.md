December's PlayStation Plus lineup leaks, Sony is bringing back tournaments, and Gotham Knights gets 4 player co-op.

Dealabs user billbil-kun reports that Mass Effect Legendary Edition will reportedly be made available for free December 6, 2022-January 3, 2023 for all PlayStation Plus Essentials, Extra, and Premium subscribers.

The game, which only has a previous gen version, is by extension playable on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The Legendary Edition is a remaster of the original Mass Effect trilogy, which based on everything we’ve seen teased from developer BioWare regarding the next Mass Effect game, will be all you’ll need to play to prepare yourself for it.

Sorry, Andromeda fans.

Biomutant and Divine Knockout are the two other games rounding out the lineup, with PS4 and PS5 versions available depending on the console you own. Biomutant is developer Experiment 101's post-apocalyptic action game starring a mammal warrior of your creation, while Divine Knockout is a third-person fighting game featuring evolving battlefields and multiple game modes.

Divine Knockout is launching as a part of PlayStation Plus, so it’s the one title you’re guaranteed to not already own!

If you’re have an Xbox, Microsoft has confirmed that Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Live Gold subscribers will be able to claim Colt Canyon, a top-down shooter set in a western wasteland, and Bladed Fury, a side-scrolling action game inspired by Chinese history and mythology. Next month. Colt Canyon will be up for grabs all month long, while Bladed Fury is free starting December 16.

Marvel's Midnight Suns is far from a superhero reskin of XCOM. It’s got a card-based combat system and a more substantial focus on roleplay and getting to know your fellow heroes. Here’s everything you need to know about Marvel’s Midnight Suns.

Marvel's Midnight Suns is the new game from  Firaxis Games, the studio behind Civilization and the past three XCOM titles. It’s far from a superhero reskin of XCOM, however, as it’s got a card-based combat system and a more substantial focus on roleplay. In the above video, we run you through everything you need to know about the upcoming game, from plot details to gameplay and what kinds of DLC to expect. 

The story in Midnight Suns is based loosely on the '90s comic book series Rise of the Midnight Sons, a crossover event that paired up the Avengers with more supernatural and magic-based characters to stop a demonic threat. You'll be playing as a new character, The Hunter, and you'll round up a team of Marvel mainstays like Dr Strange, Captain Marvel, Wolverine, and Blade. Midnight Suns is turn-based, but has a major twist: instead of set abilities, your heroes have ability cards.

Stay tuned to GameSpot for our upcoming Marvel's Midnight Suns review, and for more on the game, make sure to check out the channel and gamespot.com, we've got gameplay and hands on impressions up now.

The remake of the original Witcher game is getting a huge change, Starship Troopers Extinction is announced, and video games will be a part of James Gunn's new DCU.
#Gaming #TheWitcher #CDProjektRed 

The remake of the original Witcher is making at least one massive departure from its source; it’ll be open world, a feature that didn’t come to the franchise until 2015’s The Witcher 3, which is getting a next gen update on December 14. 

Codenamed Canis Majoris, and developed by third party studio Fool’s Theory, the remake will be built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, with former CD Projekt Red developers working on the project. The news that the game will be open world came as a part of the publisher CD Projekt’s most recent earnings report.

Both the original Witcher and its sequel, Assassin of Kings, featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. 

On top of Canis Majoris, two other Witcher projects are currently in development: Polaris and Sirius. Sirius has been described as an innovative take on the series that is aimed at both veteran fans and people new to the franchise. Currently in pre-production, it is being developed by Flame in the Flood developer The Molasses Flood and has 60+ people involved in its creation.

Project Polaris is described as a story-driven open-world RPG built on the legacy of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and has more than 150 people working on it at CD Projekt Red. This game will be the start of a new Witcher trilogy that is aiming to be delivered within a 6-year period following the Polaris release.

From fantasy monster slaying to sci-fi monster slaying, Developer Offworld Industries has revealed Starship Troopers: Extermination, a new game based on the cult-classic 1997 sci-fi film.

Extermination will recruit you into the Deep Space Vanguard, an elite Special Forces group within the Mobile Infantry that has been sent to deal with a particularly deadly bug outbreak on the planet of Valaka.

Once on the ground, 12 players will form up into four squads and will begin working on gathering resources, building a base, establishing defenses, and exterminating every bug in sight. Remember, the only good bug is a dead bug. 

Three playable classes--Assault, Support, and Defense--will be available from launch and a progression system will allow for new weapons, equipment, and perks for each class to be gradually unlocked.

The game will launch first on PC via Steam early access in 2023.
