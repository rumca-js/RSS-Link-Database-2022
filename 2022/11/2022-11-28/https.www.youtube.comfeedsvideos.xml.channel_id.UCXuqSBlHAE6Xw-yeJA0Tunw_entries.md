Part 1 of Switching to Intel Arc ended up being almost entirely hardware-related, and Luke has a lot of complaints on the software side of things only one week into the 30-day challenge. Intel usually makes software that works, just how bad could Arc Control be?

The G Cloud is a handheld gaming device from Logitech that's specifically designed for game streaming...other than that it's just an android tablet with a built in controller. I originally thought there was no way this thing could compete with the Steam Deck or other handhelds from Aya or OneXPlayer, but now that I've used it....I think maybe it could :|
