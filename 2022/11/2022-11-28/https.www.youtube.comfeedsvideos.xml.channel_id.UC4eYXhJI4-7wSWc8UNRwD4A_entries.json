Mix Laus the wrong way in a live setting and you miss out on vocals that lend whatever song they\u2019re paired with an undeniable sweetness and sincerity.\n\nBut in her Tiny Desk performance, beabadoobee drops her rock and roll tendencies to a low simmer, giving her voice ample room to shine in a collection of songs suited for our quiet little corner. She begins with \u201cSee You Soon\u201d on her acoustic guitar, the first of a string of tracks from her latest album, Beatopia, backed by a trio of strings and her longtime guitarist and collaborator Jacob Bugden (who she at one point politely ribs for failing at a recent attempt at crowd surfing while on tour). \n\n\u201cRipples\u201d and \u201cThe Perfect Pair\u201d follow, before she closes out with an unreleased song. \u201cI could have played \u2018Coffee,\u2019 but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says, laughing, referring to her 2017 viral hit, a song that sounds so simple given how far her music has come. Instead she plays what she refers to as \u201cGlue song,\u201d a love song about a romance so strong it sticks its lovers together \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 like glue.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cSee You Soon\u201d\n\u201cPerfect Pair\u201d\n\u201cRipples\u201d\n\u201cGlue\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nbeabadoobee: Vocals, Guitar \nJacob Bugden: Backing Vocals, Guitar \nKristine Kruta: Cello \nErica Swindell: Violin \nBobby Hawk: Violin \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Sofia Seidel\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton \nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #beabadoobee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHNUeBK8k7Q", "date_published": "2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
