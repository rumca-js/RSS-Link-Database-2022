So when Lizzy told us that all she'd need for her Tiny Desk concert were some microphones and a few acoustic guitars, I was surprised \u2014 curious and eager to hear her rise to the challenge of our intimate setting.\n\nHer backing vocalists are a trio coincidentally and appropriately called Tiny Habits, a group she met on Instagram about a year ago. \"I wanted to recontextualize the songs on the album with just vocals and guitar,\" Lizzy says. \"I feel like that's how I write most of my songs anyway. I just wanted them to be more intimate.\" And with those harmonies, Lizzy's gently expressive voice and a bit of acoustic guitar, the 23-year-old's stories came through powerfully clear.\n\nSET LIST\n\"ceilings\"\n\"all my ghosts\"\n\"Emma\"\n\"weird\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLizzy McAlpine: acoustic guitars, vocals\nCinya Khan: vocals\nJudah Mayowa: vocals \nMaya Rae: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistant: Sofia Seidel\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Kara Frame, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #lizzymcalpine", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7odxBDg-7JE", "date_published": "2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
