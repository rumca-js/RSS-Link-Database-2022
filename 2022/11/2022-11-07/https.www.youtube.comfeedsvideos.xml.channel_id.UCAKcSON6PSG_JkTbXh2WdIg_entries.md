Marcus Mumford released his first solo album, ‘(self-titled),’ on September 16, although Mumford himself is uncertain about dubbing it a solo record. “I mean, it's the most collaborative piece of music I've ever worked on,” he says, “so calling it a solo record feels weird.”

While on tour supporting the album, Mumford visited The Current studio to play a couple songs and to chat with host Jill Riley. Mumford spoke frankly about the making of the album, and he talks about the invaluable contributions of his collaborators, who include Brandi Carlile and Phoebe Bridgers. Mumford also talks about his friendship with Elton John, and shares a bit of humorous advice Elton gave Mumford and Sons just before the curtain was raised on their Grammy Awards performance.
