Mumford spoke frankly about the making of the album, and he talks about the invaluable contributions of his collaborators, who include Brandi Carlile and Phoebe Bridgers. Mumford also talks about his friendship with Elton John, and shares a bit of humorous advice Elton gave Mumford and Sons just before the curtain was raised on their Grammy Awards performance.\n\nWatch the full session above. \n\nVideo Segments\n00:00:00 Only Child\n00:04:21 Grace\n00:08:25 Interview with host Jill Riley\n\nCredits\nGuest - @MarcusMumfordOfficial \nHost - Jill Riley\nProducer - Derrick Stevens\nVideo - Evan Clark, Erik Stromstad\nAudio - Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics - Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer - Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
