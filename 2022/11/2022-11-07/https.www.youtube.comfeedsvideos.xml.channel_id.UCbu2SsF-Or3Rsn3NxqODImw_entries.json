Several fixes for multiple missions will be added, as a number of these \"Gigs\" had issues where elements weren't being properly triggered inside of the game. Visually, you'll see Night City residents carrying umbrellas, various floating items will rediscover the pull of gravity, and a bug related to missing collisions won't make you fall through the map. As for gameplay, it'll be possible to craft a legendary variant of the Amnesty Iconic revolver, clothing bonuses related to Quickhack cooldowns and crit damage will start working, and weapons will be able to deal more explosive damage.\u00a0\n\nPatch Notes: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cyberpunk-2077-patch-gives-everyone-in-night-city-an-umbrella/1100-6508989/\n\nGod of War Ragnarok\u00a0 is almost here and it goes without saying that this is one patch that you'll definitely want to install before booting up the game, as it seems to fix a wide variety of bugs, crashes, and other technical issues that would otherwise mar your experience.\n\nPatch Notes:\u00a0\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-day-one-patch-notes-crucial-bug-fixes/1100-6508994/\n\nHalo Infinite Winter Update weapon changes:\u00a0\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-winter-update-is-bringing-heaps-of-weapon-balance-changes/1100-6508857/\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Cyberpunk 2077\n01:20 - God of War Ragnarok\n02:10 - Halo Infinite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeasGyLUiU", "date_published": "2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "God of War Ragnarok - 4K PS5 Gameplay", "description": "Ragnarok is here!

So if you\u2019re sensitive to that type of spoilers then you'll want to start looking at muting keywords on social media.\n\nWhen it comes to new Pokemon that haven\u2019t leaked, Gimmeghoul was revealed over the weekend and the official Pokemon Twitter account has announced a new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will air tomorrow November 8 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019ve seen enough Pokemon trailers and you want something new to get excited for, then you might want to pay attention to Wednesday November 9th.\u00a0\n\nThere is a Nintendo Indie World Showcase scheduled to take place Wednesday, November 9 at 9am PT / 12pm ET and it will run for about 25 minutes. There have not been any specific games mentioned, but for comparison sake, the last Indie world features games like Ooblets, Silt and Gunbrella, a game that I recently played a demo for on Steam Deck and I\u2019m very excited for the full release.\u00a0\n\nAnother game I\u2019m waiting for is Final Fantasy XVI, a game that you\u2019ll need a PS5 for if you\u2019re not willing to be patient. We\u2019ve already known for some time that the game would be an exclusive, but now a new Playstation commercial has confirmed\u2013at around the 14 second mark\u2013that FF16 will be a PS5 exclusive for only 6 months. This timeframe pales in comparison to another upcoming Square Enix release, Forspoken, which launches January 24 and will be a PlayStation console exclusive for two years\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Pok\u00e9mon Leaks\n01:13 - Indie World\n01:37 - Final Fantasy XVI\n02:20 - Ubisoft on Steam?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sp5MmAw8Us", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers First 20 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Sonic is back with Sonic Frontiers, and here are the first 20 minutes of Kronos Island, the first of many open zones Sonic finds himself in.\n\nSonic Frontiers is Sega's latest foray with their titular mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog. For Sonic Frontiers, they've taken inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while also learning from the failures and successes of previous titles like Sonic Forces, to create an all new style for Sonic Frontiers with an Open Zone gameplay.\n\nSonic Frontiers features two main segments, open zone gameplay moments and cyber space levels similar to former Sonic games. The Open Zone gameplay is reminiscent of other open world games, with Sonic free to explore and tackle challenges as he pleases, all while gathering various items and upgrades he'll need to progress both the story and his stats.\n\nNew to Sonic Frontiers is a completely revamped battle system, allowing Sonic to not only bash enemies, but also combo and chain various attacks against them, with many mini-bosses forcing players to use Sonic's speed and platforming skillset, along with combos, to defeat them.\n\nIn this video, you'll see both the Open Zone of Kronos as well as multiple Cyber Space levels.\n\n#sonicfrontiers #sonicgameplay", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv4DNw71JEo", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers Review", "description": "Sonic Frontiers marks a bold new direction for the series, meshing traditional Sonic action with an open-ended approach to progression and exploration across its semi-open world.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCZmQWoZOCo", "date_published": "2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
