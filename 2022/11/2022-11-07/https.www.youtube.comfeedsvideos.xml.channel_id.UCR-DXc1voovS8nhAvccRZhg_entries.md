Flirc—the company I know mostly for their nice little heatsink Raspberry Pi cases—just announced a kickstarter for the Skip 1s, a universal remote that gives local control for all your media devices.

I was sad to hear Logitech killed off their Harmony line of remote controls (but am happy they're offering support for existing users—for now), but I was happy when Flirc reached out and let me know about their new remote, the Skip 1s.

They did not pay me for this short, and I pre-ordered a remote already, but they did send the pre-production sample I show here for me to test, and I'll try to review it soon!
