Microsoft is trying to buy Activision. That could happen. It could also, not happen. 

In the meantime, I kinda just wanted to look at some of the strange things that both the Xbox division and PlayStation brand have said in the past few weeks, and how they seem to be willing to say just about anything to get this deal passed or denied.

Will COD get removed from PlayStation? Was I wrong? Find out, several weeks ago, when all this was reported. Find out, eventually!
