That footage shows SuperEvan being downed and killed by an opponent who did not appear in his field of view, even though the killcam clearly shows that the attacker was standing directly in front of him. The replies to the streamer's tweet show a variety of examples of the glitch in action, suggesting that it may be commonplace.\nHowever, things aren\u2019t all bad. A Call of Duty fan booted up Warzone 2.0 recently and discovered they had a very, very generous double XP boost applied to their account and they had no idea why.\nIn a now deleted post, Reddit user CranberryCarney asked the community, \"Can someone tell me how and why I have a 1 YEAR double xp???\"\nCommenters quickly replied that CranberryCarney was likely a winner of a Mountain Dew promotion that offered up 12 months of double XP in Call of Duty as a grand prize. Now, CranberryCarney doesn't get double XP for every minute of the next year. Instead, they get one hour's worth of double XP each day for 365 days after they activate the token, according to the fine print.\nAnd if you\u2019re curious just how many other players Cranberry will be leveling up faster than, the official Call of Duty Twitter account revealed over 25 million players played War", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KECRLSbIBY", "date_published": "2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Official Overview Trailer (4K)", "description": "Check out the overview trailer for Warhammer 40K Darktide. \n\nTimestamps\n0:59 Character Creation\n2:27 Missions\n3:37 Hybrid Combat\n4:39 Cooperative Play\n5:23 Progression\n6:26 Future Content\n\n#warhammer40k #Warhammer #Darktide", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8q6917pmOo", "date_published": "2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "God of War Ragnarok Director Breaks Down Biggest Moments", "description": "Listen to the full uncut interview on the GameSpot After Dark podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gamespot-after-dark/id1476085691\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5qmuPYfpj7R7yHXEtKBocG\n\nThis video contains heavy spoilers for God of War Ragnarok. \n\nGod of War Ragnarok had a daunting task ahead of it: not only did it have to wrap up a sprawling tale of fate, prophecy, and parenthood in a neat bow, but do it all under the looming presence of the end of the world, at least, in Norse mythology. But succeed it did, with many fans and critics (including GameSpot's own Tamoor Hussain, who awarded the game a 9/10) praising the ending, and the path Kratos and Atreus took to get there.\n\nGod of War Ragnarok's director, Eric Williams, joins Tamoor Hussain and Lucy James to discuss the game's ending at length, and we're not kidding when we tell you that this video contains spoilers. We discuss Tyr's important role in the game, Odin's plans and his relationship with his family, and that all important ending: Ragnarok itself. \n\nWe touch upon many other topics, including the death of a beloved character, Freya's role in the whole saga, and the ups and downs of parenthood. \n\nFor more God of War Ragnarok, make sure to check out some of our other videos, including our review, best tips, and more.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #spoilers #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmXln1nUN4E", "date_published": "2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "High on Life - 25 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Enjoy 25 Minutes of exploration and firefights with lots of foul-mouthed and zany characters in High On Life.

However, your Switch must be undocked, and you have to use a Joy-Con attached to the Switch, along with a wireless controller.\n\nAnother exploration glitch making its way around the internet is one that allows you to get up slopes that are impeding your progress.\u00a0\n\nZullieTheWitch on Twitter posted a clip of her Scarlet game. The video shows her attempting to jump up a slope and sliding down it. Then, she turns around and leaps up the hill backwards, successfully making it up. Our own attempts have gotten the trick to work. If you are interested in trying it yourself, the key is mashing the jump button as you descend, so that your jump starts before you begin to slide down.\n\nIn other Nintendo related news, the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass will soon be halfway to the finish line, as the third of six eight-course waves has been confirmed for a December 7 launch date.\n\nWave 3 of the Booster Course Pass will, like the previous waves, add eight more courses to the Mario Kart 8 roster, with all of them coming from previous games in the franchise. There's Wii Maple Treeway from Mario Kart Wii, DS Peach Gardens from Mario Kart DS and 3DS Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 7 just to name a few.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZTqjImeYKg", "date_published": "2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
