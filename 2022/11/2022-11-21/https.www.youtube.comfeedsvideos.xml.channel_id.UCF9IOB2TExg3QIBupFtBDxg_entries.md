Since the pandemic began

Over 30,000 excess deaths involving heart disease

(average over 230 additional deaths a week)

While Covid-19 infection was likely a significant factor

Covid infections no longer a driving force

Focusing on COVID-19 deaths alone without examining total excess deaths

—may underestimate the true impact of the pandemic
