There was the live band assembled for the occasion, which included George Lewis Jr. (aka Twin Shadow) on bass and drummer Chuck Treece, who's worked with everyone from Bad Brains to Billy Joel. There was the lack of a microphone \u2014 and, by extension, vocal amplification \u2014 not to mention the fact that, as Santigold herself noted, \"I don't know what I'm doing up here with no dancers.\"\n\nFortunately, Santi White has been revising and reinventing her sound for two decades now. If anything, performing her genre-straddling R&B and electro-pop with a live band represented a return to roots, given that she'd spent the early aughts singing in the punk band Stiffed \u2014 with Treece on drums, in fact. Everything about this set feels like the culmination of hard work, from the custom arrangements to the singer's hair/hat combo, an architectural marvel that warrants closer inspection. Given that Santigold had canceled her North American tour weeks earlier \u2014 she flew into D.C. for this occasion \u2014 it's a wonder her Tiny Desk debut even happened. Thank goodness it did.\n\nSET LIST\n\"L.E.S.
