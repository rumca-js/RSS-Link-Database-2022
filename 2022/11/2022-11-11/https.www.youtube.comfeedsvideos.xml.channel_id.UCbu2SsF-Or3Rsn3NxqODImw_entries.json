Part of this has to do with the long shadow cast by its directly-inspired and much-beloved younger sibling, Final Fantasy Tactics. Despite receiving an incredible remake in 2011, PSP exclusivity once again limited the audience for Tactics Ogre. Now, with the release of the HD and massively revamped Tactics Ogre Reborn on every platform under the sun, Square Enix is taking steps to correct a long-standing injustice--though some quibbles with presentation and gameplay changes keep this from being the definitive version of the all-time classic.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38rHWkexJQM", "date_published": "2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Top 23 Things We Had To Test: COD Modern Warfare 2", "description": "We test what can stop the currently broken Riot Shield, if you can hang off of the skids of a helicopter, what happens when you shock a Proximity Mine out of someone\u2019s hands, how many shield bashes it takes to get to the center of a Juggernaut, and more.\n\nHang off the skids of a helicopter? - 00:00\nIntro - 00:25\nWhat can stop a Riot Shield? - 00:36\nHow many hits with the Riot Shield to kill a Juggernaut? - 03:01\nEscape a Proximity Mine by dolphin diving? - 04:00\nWhat equipment can shock sticks destroy?\u00a0- 04:50\nWhat can you hack or DDOS? - 07:12\nHow many times can you and an enemy hack a mine? - 08:37\nWhat walls can you shoot through? - 09:13\nFunny kill montage - 11:21\n\n #gaming  #callofduty  #gamespot #modernwarfare2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Lf1axItFM", "date_published": "2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
