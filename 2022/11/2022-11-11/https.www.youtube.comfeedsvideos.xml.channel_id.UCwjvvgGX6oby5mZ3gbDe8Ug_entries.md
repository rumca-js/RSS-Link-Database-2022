China has the world's largest auto market, and investors are closely watching the performance of Tesla, the largest American electric car company, in China, where many believe the growth potential is far greater than in Europe or the US. 
It is a familiar pattern for the Chinese Communist government to use Western companies to improve China's industrial capabilities. But in the case of Tesla, China's economy has already begun to crumble before the CCP can complete its scheme, and the decline will only happen faster and faster. Tesla's China dream is destined to be lost, and the longer it stays entangled with the CCP, the greater the price it will likely pay.
