Marcus Mumford released his first solo album, ‘(self-titled),’ on September 16, although Mumford himself is uncertain about dubbing it a solo record. “I mean, it's the most collaborative piece of music I've ever worked on,” he says, “so calling it a solo record feels weird.”

While on tour supporting the album, Mumford visited The Current studio to play a couple songs and to chat with host Jill Riley. Here's Marcus Mumford's performance of "Only Child," recorded during that session.
