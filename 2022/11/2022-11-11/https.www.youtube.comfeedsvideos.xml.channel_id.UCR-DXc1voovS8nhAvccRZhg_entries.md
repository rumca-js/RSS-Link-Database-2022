Now my wife doesn't get angry at me for leaving the garage door open all day!

Here's the open source Raspberry Pi Pico W garage door sensor project, with instructions for how you can set up the same thing at your house: https://github.com/geerlingguy/pico-w-garage-door-sensor

And here are the items I purchased to complete the installation (some are affiliate links):

  - Seco-Larm SM-4201-LQ Overhead Door Sensor: https://amzn.to/3EjG1qp
  - RPi Pico Terminal Block Breakout Board: https://amzn.to/3tkZQY9
  - Small breadboards for prototyping: https://amzn.to/3A6ha7b
  - Breadboard solderless jumper wires: https://amzn.to/3UHCmYO

You can also buy the Pico WH ('W with Headers') if you want to avoid having to solder headers on the Pico W yourself.
