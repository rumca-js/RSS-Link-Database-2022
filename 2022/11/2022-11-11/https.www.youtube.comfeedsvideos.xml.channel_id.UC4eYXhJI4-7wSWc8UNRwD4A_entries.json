Yet the band and cast of The Lion King were ecstatic to spend their one free day traveling from New York to Washington, D.C. to celebrate 25 years of the iconic musical with a performance at NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk.\n\nMany of the songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice will be familiar \u2014 like the Oscar-winning \u201cCan You Feel the Love Tonight\u201d and \u201cHakuna Matata.\u201d But the cast also treated the enthusiastic Tiny Desk crowd to songs written just for the stage. \u201cThey Live In You\u201d wasn\u2019t in the original movie, but is sung in the show by Mufasa (L. Steven Taylor) to his cub Simba (Brandon A. McCall). The young lioness Nala sings \u201cShadowland'', another gem from the musical sung by Pearl Khwezi (the first South African cast in the role).\n\nInfused throughout the music of The Lion King is spine-tingling African rhythm and language. It\u2019s as captivating as the groundbreaking costume design by director, co-writer and artist Julie Taymor. The team at Disney Theatrical sent the masks of Simba and Nala in time to be prominently displayed on the desk during the concert. Examining their details up close gave me chills \u2014 just like the ones I felt watching the show at the New Amsterdam Theatre, way back in 1997 when the musical first debuted.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cCircle of Life\u201d\n\u201cThey Live in You\u201d\n\u201cCan You Feel the Love Tonight\u201d\n\u201cHakuna Matata\u201d\n\u201cEndless Night / Shadowland\u201d\n\u201cCircle of Life\u201d (Reprise)\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nCAST\nL.
