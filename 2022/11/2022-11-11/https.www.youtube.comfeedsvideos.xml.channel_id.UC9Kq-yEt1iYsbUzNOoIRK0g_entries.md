After over a decade of superhero domination, a certain movie absolutely crushed it at the box office in 2022, in what many described as a refreshing change of pace. Sure, it was still a sequel, but still, people flocked to the cinemas to see Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick.

Top Gun: Maverick definitely raises some questions though. Like will Maverick ever get in trouble? Is this the plot of Star Wars? Do any of these jets have security? Why are they so easy to steal? Do shirtless beach games really lead to such camaraderie? Was that a war crime?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Top Gun: Maverick!
