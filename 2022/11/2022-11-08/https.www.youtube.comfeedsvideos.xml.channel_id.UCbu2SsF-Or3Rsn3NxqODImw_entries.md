Skyrim, Kingdom Hearts and more join PlayStation’s Game Catalog. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2’s first season gets new details. 
#GamingNews #PS5 #ModernWarfare2

This month the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog is gaining some big additions. Members at the Extra and Premium tiers can look forward to playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, Ghost Recon Breakpoint and The Division 2.

But that's not all because also soaring its way into the catalog is Sora and gang with Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix, 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue and KH 3 and Melody of Memory. 

And you might be as well because early this month, PlayStation added 3 free games to its essential PlayStation Plus tier. Those include:  
Nioh 2 is a yokai-slaying action game from Team Ninja that combines the pinpoint swordplay of Ninja Gaiden with the mechanics of Dark Souls. The Lego Harry Potter Collection, a game that combines Years 1-4 and Years 5-7 into one game. And the physics-based puzzle game Heavenly Bodies. 

A week from today on November 16, Modern Warfare II will get its first major update with the launch of Season 1 and Warzone 2.0 will be unleashed on the masses. In a blog post, Activision ran through the specifics of what's new in Season 1, and it's a lot of information. 

Modern Warfare II is adding fan-favorite maps in Season 1, and those include Shoot House and Shipment. Both maps are "reimagined" for Modern Warfare II, Activision said. These are smaller maps with a lot of action, especially Shipment, which is one of Call of Duty's smallest maps.

Cyberpunk 2077 has already received some substantial upgrades this year and now patch 1.61 has been announced for PC, console, and Stadia (rest in peace). Several fixes for multiple missions will be added, as a number of these "Gigs" had issues where elements weren't being properly triggered inside of the game. Visually, you'll see Night City residents carrying umbrellas, various floating items will rediscover the pull of gravity, and a bug related to missing collisions won't make you fall through the map. As for gameplay, it'll be possible to craft a legendary variant of the Amnesty Iconic revolver, clothing bonuses related to Quickhack cooldowns and crit damage will start working, and weapons will be able to deal more explosive damage.
