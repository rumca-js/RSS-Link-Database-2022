This week on Breakout we're taking about our early impressions of God of War: Ragnarök, Sonic Frontiers, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and more.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
