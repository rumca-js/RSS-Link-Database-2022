Hello and welcome to.. TUES- THURSDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! SORRY FOR THE DELAY, but I had to rewrite this one like 10 times to get this right and im glad I did! Lots of exciting stuff from Qualcomm launching its AR2 gen 1 chipset working with Pokemon Go developers Niantic, HTC Vive has a new VR headset on the way, Pimax makes some... very weird announcements... a potential Quest 2 competitor in the shape of a Nintendo Switch? hmm.. Also Pico isn't doing very well unfortunately. ALL THAT AND SO MUCH MORE! THANK YOU! OH! Also a final fantasy XIV VR mod!!
