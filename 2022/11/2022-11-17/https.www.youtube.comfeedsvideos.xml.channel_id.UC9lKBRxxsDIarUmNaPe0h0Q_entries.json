Or will it? There's almost no doubt now that a recession is coming, but in reality, nobody can predict just how badly it's going to affect our lives.\n\nEconomists, world leaders, and CEOs are all weighing in on the coming recession, and discussing what could be ahead for the Unites States, and the world. One such person is Amazon's owner Jeff Bezos, who has even gone so far as to tell people to stop buying large items to save for the future, an announcement that could obviously affect his company's profits.\n\nBut just how bad might the 2023 recession be? And are our leaders really properly preparing us for what might be coming? I'll try to answer that in this video.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - The economy is getting worse\n0:39 - Are we in a recession?
