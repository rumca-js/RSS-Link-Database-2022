I'M BACK WITH MORE HALF-LIFE. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy Alyx, so I've forced my way to do another Half-Life VR video. Now we just need Half-Life 1 to be remade in VR. And we can complete the triforce. 

The next major video will be Fallout: New Vegas, but based on how this one does I will review Half-Life 1/Black Mesa pretty soon. Regardless of if it is put into VR!
