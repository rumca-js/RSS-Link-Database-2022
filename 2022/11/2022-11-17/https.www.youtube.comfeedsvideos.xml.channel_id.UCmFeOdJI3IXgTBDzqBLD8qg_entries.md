The Metaverse will bring about a new age of crypto trading, business, NFT's, and investing. But there is another side to the Metaverse. People think the metaverse is dead and the metaverse is collapsing but this isn't true. Because Mark Zuckerberg sees the Metaverse as a new business venture to extract the money out our depressed and lonely generation. Mark Zuckerberg wants the metaverse to make money from his users privacy and data which poses a major threat to our society. This video explains the metaverse and what it means for business and society. There is lots of money and wealth to be made.
