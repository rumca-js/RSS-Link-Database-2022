They are now running a massive early Black Friday Sale, plus 10% off on any purchase with code UPISNOTJUMP. \nThanks to Established Titles for sponsoring this video!\n\nI'M BACK WITH MORE HALF-LIFE. \n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy Alyx, so I've forced my way to do another Half-Life VR video. Now we just need Half-Life 1 to be remade in VR. And we can complete the triforce. \n\nThe next major video will be Fallout: New Vegas, but based on how this one does I will review Half-Life 1/Black Mesa pretty soon. Regardless of if it is put into VR!\n\nPatreon bros: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch-o-bros: https://www.pixelempire.com/pages/upisnotjump \nTwitter-o-fish: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump \nTikTok-o-clock: @upisnotjumpofficial \n\nEditing workflow partly by: https://twitter.com/MudanTV\n\nThumbnail Artwork by Skutch: https://twitter.com/skutchdraws?lang=en \n\nSuper big thank you to my memberz! \nRyan Moser \nSiberial \n\n3D model for faucet made by Glub: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-last-drop-da33a40a9b1e4b33ba822a9acbca517d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIOQP4yaMxE", "date_published": "2022-11-17 22:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
