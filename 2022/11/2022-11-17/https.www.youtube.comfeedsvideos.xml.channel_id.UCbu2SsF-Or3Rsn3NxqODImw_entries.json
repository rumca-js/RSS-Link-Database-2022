Multiple reviews, including our own at GameSpot, mention that while the open world is an excellent step forward for the franchise, the games are held back by technical issues such as pop in, frame rate drops, and muddy textures.\n\nAs such, the current score at GameSpot sister site Metacritic sits at a 77, which is the lowest score for a new mainline Pokemon game ever. Before these entries, no new generation of Pokemon has scored below an 80 before. \n\nI should note, that neither Pokemon Red/Blue or Gold/Silver have ratings on the site, but their remakes Fire Red/Leaf Green and Heart Gold/SoulSilver are also rated highly. Which of course they are, cus those are some of the greatest games of all time.\n\nDespite the mixed reception to the new games, it seems to not have had any affect on sales, as Scarlet and Violet are the most preordered Pokemon games in the series\u2019 history.\n\nThe Pokemon Company\u2019s chief operating officer Takato Utsunomiya announced the news at a launch event for the pair of Pokemon games, though didn't specify how many preorders the games had received. He did note that 440 million units of Pokemon-related games have been sold since the launch of the very first titles in Japan, Pokemon Red and Green.\n\nThe chief operating officer also revealed that because of the new elements Scarlet and Violet has introduced, for first-time players, playtimes could go all the way up to 60 hours, which is quite a bit longer than the typical Pokemon adventure.\n\nIf you are picking up either of the new games, make sure to grab your free, rare Pikachu. Once you unlock the Poke Portal in the game, which requires you to to start the Treasure Hunt activity early on in the game, you\u2019ll be able to access Mystery Gifts like in previous entries in the series. Select \u201cGet Via Internet\u201d and the Pikachu will be awarded to you.\n\nWhat makes this Pikachu worth obtaining? Besides the adorability factor, this particular electric rat knows the move Fly, which Pikachu are usually incapable of learning. Usually reserved for Flying-type Pokemon, Fly is a useful two-turn attack that can demolish Fighting and Grass-type Pokemon on the field, adding some extra utility to this particular Pikachu. This Pikachu will also change its typing from Electric to Flying when it is terastalized, the new power up mechanic in the game.\n\nMake sure to head to GameSpot dot come for a ton, and I do mean a ton, more content around Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in too deep with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 to care about pocket monsters, and you also have Xfinity internet, I hope you haven\u2019t paid for your battle pass yet, as you can pick it up for free.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oToIni2cUo", "date_published": "2022-11-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "First Look At Splinter Cell Remake | GameSpot News", "description": "Ubisoft shows off concept art for the remake of the original Splinter Cell, Xbox and Ubisoft Black Friday sales are live, and Xbox integration with Discord gets even better in its latest update.\n#Gaming #SplinterCell #Xbox \n\nFans that have been patiently waiting for updates on the next Splinter Cell got their first taste of what Sam Fisher\u2019s next mission is going to look like.\n\nUbisoft, taking the original game and rebuilding it from the ground up in its own Snowdrop engine, unveiled concept art of the remake in celebration of the franchise\u2019s 20th anniversary.\n\nDuring a conversation as a part of that celebration with the development team at Ubisoft Toronto, associate level design director Zavian Porter explained the goal of the project is to create a \"top tier-remake to push quality as much as possible that should help us set a good foundation for the franchise going forward\". So it sounds like the remake itself won\u2019t be a simple one off.\n\nIt also sounds like the remake will incorporate mechanics and elements from other games in the franchise that followed. the original\u2019s release, with senior game designer Andy Schmoll stating that the team is, \"exploring new and innovative tech and ideas, as well as features and elements from the other Splinter Cell titles\".\n\nUnfortunately, this will be the last update for the much anticipated remake for a while, as the team will be, \u201cgoing dark for a little while so it can focus on making the absolute best game possible.\"\n\nIn the meantime, fans both new and old can experience the original game, which initially was an exclusive for the very first Xbox, for the great deal of free. The deal can be obtained via Ubisoft itself for the PC.\n\nSpeaking of Xbox, Ubisoft, and deals, Black Friday discounts for the two gaming giants are already out in the wild.\n\nXbox is discounting its Series S console to $250. Highlights of its game sales include Madden NFL 23 for $35, Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands: Next Level Edition also for $35, and the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt: Game of the Year Edition for $10, which will be getting a free next gen upgrade in December.\n\nFrom Ubisoft, 2020\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, last year\u2019s Far Cry 6, and this year\u2019s Rainbow Six Extraction can all be nabbed for under $20.

Removing XCOM's frustrating percentage system--which could cause even the most well-planned strategies to have a chance of just not working--makes the turn-based tactical combat in Midnight Suns a lot more fun. And thanks to the deckbuilding card system, randomness still factors into the equation, creating a healthy bit of challenge.\n\nYou can expect more words from me regarding the actual gameplay of Midnight Suns when the full review embargo is up. For now, I want to briefly touch on an aspect of Midnight Suns we haven't really had a chance to see a whole lot of yet: the writing and story. \n\nTo recap, in Midnight Suns you play as the Hunter, prophesied to defeat your mother, Lilith, and seal away her dark magic forever. You're assigned leadership of the latest iteration of the Midnight Suns, a team composed of superheroes with powers that dabble in the mystic and supernatural, going out to face Lilith's demonic forces and the members of HYDRA she's enthralled. Lilith's war on humanity attracts the attention of less magically-inclined heroes as well, and so your efforts are also bolstered by members of the Avengers and X-Men. Each character features their own unique abilities, portrayed as cards within a deck, allowing you to switch up your strategies depending on who you bring on a mission.\n\nI wasn't expecting a story quite so action hero-focused given the namesake Midnight Suns is pulling from. It's a bit by-the-numbers, even by the standards of superhero fiction, so major plot points can be seen coming from a mile away and moments of grief or tragedy aren't given adequate room to fester, as the more wise-cracking heroes are quick to fill the silence with jokes to liven up the situation. So far, that's keeping the game's story from being great, but it's certainly not bad by any stretch. If you've watched any of the team-oriented MCU movies, you already kind of know what you're getting with Midnight Suns--this game feels more like the MCU's lighthearted take on Age of Ultron and less like the darker Midnight Suns comic book series. \n\nBetween the major plot points, Midnight Suns allows you to explore optional, more personal side stories. And it's in those smaller interactions between the Hunter and the individual members of their team that the game manages to squeeze out some incredible moments. Building up your friendship with certain heroes unlocks additional cutscenes and conversations with them, many of which culminate in heartwarming reveals or devastating discoveries. Magik, in particular, is one of the best-written characters in Midnight Suns, and her friendship arc with the Hunter--which sees the two bond over their respective struggles with their innate darkness--has been my favorite part of the game thus far.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy0laO7oAbg", "date_published": "2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Review", "description": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet's open-world approach reinvigorates the long-running series.\n\n#pokemon #pokemonscarletandviolet #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDMdYRUJ8hE", "date_published": "2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Callisto Protocol - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Watch The Callisto Protocol Official Launch Trailer featuring the song 'Lost Again' by Kings Elliot.
