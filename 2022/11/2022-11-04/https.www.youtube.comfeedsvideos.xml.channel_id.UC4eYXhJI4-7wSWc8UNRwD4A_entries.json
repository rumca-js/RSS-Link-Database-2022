The change in weather was apt for the Los Angeles-based artist whose music often sheds light on dark times. \n\nI first discovered NoSo when they entered the Tiny Desk Contest back in 2019. Even though they didn\u2019t win, their spectacular guitar playing, memorable hooks and sentimental lyricism left a lasting impression. They bring all those elements to their Tiny Desk set, in which they\u2019re accompanied by musicians Marian Li-Pino on drums and Jayla Tang on violin. NoSo\u2019s soft-spoken nature complements their musical dexterity to create the kind intimate performance that really shines in the close quarters behind the Desk.\n\nAcross the three-song set, Hwong sings about the \u201cquiet suburbia\u201d they grew up in and reflects on feelings about their evolving gender identity. The final song of the set, \u201cEverything I\u2019ve Got,\u201d is an aching portrayal of the way confidence and longing can be upended by gender dysphoria; before playing the song, Hwong shares that they\u2019ve \u201chealed a lot\u201d since writing it. \u201cI know if I was born fairly, I\u2019d be it / I\u2019ll love you with everything I\u2019ve got,\u201d they sing quietly over a swelling violin and an audience of sniffling NPR staff. \n\nNoSo reflects on their adolescence \u2014 often granting newfound compassion to their younger self \u2014 across their debut album, Stay Proud Of Me, which came out earlier this year. They say releasing that record and playing a Tiny Desk three years after submitting to the Contest feels like \u201ca real full-circle moment.\u201d Toward the end of the set, Hwong smiles and admits: \u201cThis is a dream come true.\u201d\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cI Feel You\u201d\n\u201cSuburbia\u201d\n\u201cEverything I've Got\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nBaek Hwong: guitar, vocals\nMarian Li-Pino: drums\nJayla Tang: violin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Michael Zamora, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Alex Drewenskus\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Kara Frame\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #noso", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3axBzTe2-I", "date_published": "2022-11-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
