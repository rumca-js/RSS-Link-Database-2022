I spent 5 of those in the same company - company A, working up from a Grad engineer to an SDE3, 3 promos, in that company. I had a very few stumbles there and always performed and handled transition pretty well.<p>I jumped ship January of this year over company changes, projects getting cancelled and stopping from a revolving door of Product heads coming in and out. My goal is not to get a senior title but to progress in my knowledge and move on from JS over to a Java focus. I want to build a product or even just some features; I want to code and earn my way to seniority; not start and stop every quarter.<p>I move to the next company, Company B, in March as SDE; everyone else on the team is Senior SDE with 7+ years experience and above: I'm the most junior.<p>Company B is a start up and I'm expected to contribute from the off; build out big features and bring some solid knowledge base to the team... but I just totally crap the bed.<p>The code I write is problematic; there's no documentation to set stuff up, so I go without the code running on my local machine for a while, which obviously causes issues. I make a bunch of amateur mistakes and my direct team lead takes a dislike to me for, naturally, messing up a lot. I go from the guy who can solve the problem and save the day to the guy causing the problem; I'm not trusted at all (and why would they)?<p>I'm lashed with negative feedback in my first couple weeks, so buck up and genuinely put huge effort in; my code gets better, but the team lead expects tickets closed faster than I can. I feel incredibly untalented and dreadful at my job; every one of my system design choices are the incorrect ones and aren't taken into account. Eventually - right before probation ends - I'm terminated when I fail to complete an MVP of a new system feature.<p>Obviously, I'd seen the writing on the wall, started interviewing elsewhere and now work at Company C, but as a Senior Software Engineer this time.<p>Company C is a big company in a bit of a niche area. I'm working on a team migrating from a dreadful old system to a more modern Micro-service base system. I'm expecting to do dreadful and underperform, get fired and end up exiting the industry within a couple weeks.<p>Instead, I'm back to my old self again: I'm reviewing code with confidence, pushing up solid features, contributing to initiatives and mentoring junior developers again. The code and features I write are solid and passing QA.<p>There's no tech lead helping me, so I'm just using my gut and it's going swimmingly. I have discussions with the other senior engineer on the team and my technical knowledge is respected; my relationship with my manager is pleasant and I'm performing accordingly.<p>It's only been a couple months but I feel like myself again; like I went from the back of the herd to the front of the pack... but I'm still so confused about what exactly is the root of my performance increase; or rather, what made me become worse.<p>Has anyone else ever had this sort of experience, this sort of bumpy ride in their career? Are start-ups hard to work in that larger companies specifically because of expectations, of what's considered \"appropriate\" at different levels? Am I just a lucky idiot fumbling back in and not even realising?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475720\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475720</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475720", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:43:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Lawsuit Against Meta Invokes Modern Portfolio Theory to Protect Shareholders", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/04/lawsuit-against-meta-invokes-modern-portfolio-theory-to-protect-diversified-shareholders/\">https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/04/lawsuit-against-meta-invokes-modern-portfolio-theory-to-protect-diversified-shareholders/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475530\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475530</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "link": "https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/04/lawsuit-against-meta-invokes-modern-portfolio-theory-to-protect-diversified-shareholders/", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:24:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Twitter layoffs gutted election information teams days before midterms", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/05/twitter-layoffs-election-impact/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/05/twitter-layoffs-election-impact/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475516\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475516</a></p>\n<p>Points: 52</p>\n<p># Comments: 27</p>", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/05/twitter-layoffs-election-impact/", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:22:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Darcy \u2013 federated social media platform", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://darcy.is/\">https://darcy.is/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475505\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475505</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://darcy.is/", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:21:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Starlink to start \u201cdeprioritizing\u201d taffic after 1TB monthly", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NfSTpZN.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/NfSTpZN.jpg</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475482\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475482</a></p>\n<p>Points: 39</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>", "link": "https://i.imgur.com/NfSTpZN.jpg", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:19:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Fed warns of low market liquidity in $24T Treasury market in report", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-warns-of-low-market-liquidity-in-24-trillion-treasury-market-in-latest-financial-stability-report-11667592786\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-warns-of-low-market-liquidity-in-24-trillion-treasury-market-in-latest-financial-stability-report-11667592786</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475480\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475480</a></p>\n<p>Points: 32</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-warns-of-low-market-liquidity-in-24-trillion-treasury-market-in-latest-financial-stability-report-11667592786", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:19:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hollow City: Edward Hopper\u2019s portraits of urban alienation", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/hollow-city-arn\">https://thebaffler.com/latest/hollow-city-arn</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475435\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33475435</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://thebaffler.com/latest/hollow-city-arn", "date_published": "2022-11-04 23:17:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Reveddit.com: Improving online discourse with transparent moderation", "description": "<p>Hi HN, this talk represents a summary of my work over the last four years on addressing shadow moderation with Reveddit.<p>Let me know what you think, good or bad, and I'll do my best to answer.<p>What is shadow moderation?

co-founders of Shimmer (<a href=\"https://shimmer.care\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://shimmer.care</a>). We offer one-to-one ADHD Coaching for adults. It was born out of my own roller coaster of a journey navigating my ADHD diagnosis.<p>Getting diagnosed with ADHD as an adult is complicated\u2014equally heartbreaking and liberating. You literally need to rewrite your whole life narrative in light of this new realization. The process currently is super confusing and expensive (medications, therapy, coaching, tools, apps, etc.) and I just wished someone would guide me through it. Someone to personalize things for me, ask me good questions, and encourage me when I was feeling down.<p>My experience was the basis for what Shimmer is today. We\u2019re creating an ADHD coaching service that is actually affordable (5-10X cheaper than traditional ADHD coaching, in fact!), personalized to your life (because what works for me may not work for you), and focused on action instead of theory (because we\u2019re not short of knowledge\u2014we just aren\u2019t <i>doing</i> it!).<p>Our service is fit for ADHD brains. We merge the best worlds of telehealth (e.g. therapy/coaching sessions) and asynchronous apps (e.g. Headspace, Noom) to create a solid combo of human accountability and app-based support. You get matched with an ADHD-specialized coach, meet weekly in focused video/audio sessions where you set weekly goals, and over time, bit-by-bit start building a new day-to-day that supports your goals: new routines, systems, and skills.<p>Our program is rooted in science-backed methodologies including Health & Wellness Coaching, Cognitive Behavioral Coaching (CBC/CBT), Acceptance Commitment Training (ACT), positive psychology, and solution-focused coaching. The way we deliver it, however, is less rigid and more experimental. In each 15-min session and in the asynchronous portions, you\u2019ll draw on collective ADHD community knowledge to work with one thing a week in your life that you\u2019d like to improve on. Your coach will support you via text access (in-app) and by seeing and reacting to your weekly \u201cActions\u201d.<p>In terms of the app itself, there are 3 main components: (1) a daily/weekly simple check-list where you track your coaching tasks, checking them off (automatically pings your coach) and reflecting on your progress in-app, (2) a resource hub where you\u2019ll find short, bite-sized content in service of your coaching journey, not standalone education to just \u201cread up on\u201d, and (3) your personalized chat with your coach where they\u2019ll guide you through the journey\u2014checking in on your completed/in-completed tasks, giving you feedback, and sending you resources.<p>On the back end, our coaches have web and mobile apps that are designed to save them time and cognitive effort, so that they can focus on coaching. Simple things like \u201cscheduled sends\u201d and a prioritized message list are included to help them manage a large case load with less effort.<p>It\u2019s $99/mo. for 15-min weekly \u201cbite-sized\u201d sessions, or $349/mo. for 45-min \u201csimilar-to-traditional\u201d coaching sessions. Traditional coaching can run $400-700+/mo. (up to the thousands depending on the coach). We also reserve a portion of our memberships for those with financial need, on a case by case basis.<p>If you have ADHD (or think you do), we\u2019d love for you to check out our platform and give us critical feedback (or positive reinforcement!). It\u2019s a super streamlined and ADHD-friendly signup process and in honor of our launch and celebration of October being ADHD Awareness Month, the first month is 40% off (offer until Nov 12).<p>I invite the greater Hacker News community to share any experiences you have with ADHD & navigating care, and am always open to scheduling a 1:1 call to learn more!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468611\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468611</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468611", "date_published": "2022-11-04 15:46:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: HN-like forum for literature and cinema?", "description": "<p>Is there any forum like HN where people discuss film, literature, etc?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468314\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468314</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468314", "date_published": "2022-11-04 15:27:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Productivity has fallen, and experts are puzzled.

You can integrate it with Docker, GitHub Actions and Node. Your tests can have multiple steps, with shared context between them. Lastly, you can use it as a library and in combination with other testing tools like Jest, Ava, Mocha (and soon Insomnia).<p>If you want to step out of locked-in cloud solutions, give our tool a

(mainly from US?) are having a hard time finding top-level paying jobs.<p>I work on Western Europe, and in theory we should be more screwed up than other Western countries... but:<p>- Just landed (3 months ago) on a job that pays me 20% more than the previous one. I could have switched jobs years before, but I just got the courage to do it now<p>- Keep seeing the same amount of job offers on Linkedin. Now, I have the tendency to keep a list of companies that hire on an Excel file, so I can come back to it later and compare past and current situations of such companies. I have over 200 companies that operate in Western Europe (but not exclusively) that I consider \"top-level\" (at least from my point of view). The effect of the recession? Well, it has had one, but somehow very poor: many companies went from having around 1000 job offers open in linkedin on a weekly basis to having now around a third of that. Sure, they are not hiring like crazy anymore, but they are still hiring!<p>- A company that announced a 14% lay-off back in May, is now hiring again (the same pattern as before: when they were offering thousands of jobs before, now they are offering a few hundred)<p>Now, I have no idea how FAANG is doing in Western Europe (I never cared to track them) because I have no plans to work for them. But all the other non-FAANG companies over here are hiring. So, I don't feel the recession (yet). Touching wood.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465760\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465760</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465760", "date_published": "2022-11-04 12:54:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "AstraZeneca patients data exposed for over a year due to password snafu", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/astrazeneca-passwords-exposed-patient-data/\">https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/astrazeneca-passwords-exposed-patient-data/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465750\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465750</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/astrazeneca-passwords-exposed-patient-data/", "date_published": "2022-11-04 12:53:39+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["privacy", "astrazeneca", "data leak", "covid"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Sudo: Heap-based overflow with small passwords", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2139911\">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2139911</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465707\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465707</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2139911", "date_published": "2022-11-04 12:49:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Linode Outage in Dallas, Fremont, Atlanta, Newark, and Toronto Data Centers", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://status.linode.com/incidents/bqlkm3ttppdl\">https://status.linode.com/incidents/bqlkm3ttppdl</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465645\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33465645</a></p>\n<p>Points: 34</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "link": "https://status.linode.com/incidents/bqlkm3ttppdl", "date_published": "2022-11-04 12:45:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Telling people you're a self taught developer in YouTube is a big business now", "description": "<p>No bootcamp, no degree, but I made it. Do you think that these people are legit. Do you think it's practically possible to learn everything without any structure, discipline? Theoritically, it's possible, if you're highly motivated. But I tried to spend a month doing it but I went nowhere. I didn't even know the basic of the things like, how much hrs of content should I watch daily to not get overwhelmed?<p>And selecting good courses was another confusion. A course in html, css would be 40 hr long (with project). That'd take 40 days to complete. Can anyone remain patient for 40 days to learn html, css on their own w/o any structure and guidance? I could not.<p>Please tell me your tips for being a self taught developer.<p>I do have a degree in computer science but degree in CS vs programming is different. It needs to  be learnt again.<p>Share your working tips to become a self taught developer.
