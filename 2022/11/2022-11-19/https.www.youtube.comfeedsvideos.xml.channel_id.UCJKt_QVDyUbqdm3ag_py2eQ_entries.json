Xigmatek was a well known Crysis modder i believe. He had a Youtube channel where i think i downloaded this from - it was so long ago i can't be sure. I couldn't find this video on Youtube anymore. So here it is. Reupload quality is what it is (the file i have is 720p mp4).\n\nMany of his videos featured nice music, mostly made by him i think. This video features his \"Awake to the Future\" track.\n\nXigmatek on SoundCloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/xigmatek\n(i'm not 100% sure, but music style and how it sounds like (mastering) gives me strong vibes that it could be him and not someone with the same name)\n\nThe Youtube channel currently named Xigmatek is not him.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcH4m2tJOoI", "date_published": "2022-11-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
