2016's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows was a sequel to the 2014 reboot of the Turtles franchise by Michael Bay. They tried to build another Transformers franchise, but unfortunately the first movie was such a let down financially and in terms of the reception that even though the sequel improved things a lot... the series was cancelled right there.

Here's how to successfully use IP in your movie franchise adaptation.
