The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been out for four years at this point, and players have found some amazing things, intended or not, that keep the game and its sense of discovery feeling fresh.\n\n#botw #breathofthewild #gaming \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:12 Breaking Ball Chains\n0:34 Frozen and Raw Skin\n0:54 ChuChu Shock Damage Tricks\n1:27 Shield Jump Cancel Tricks\n2:09 Hard Level 3 NPC Interactions\n2:54 Hateno Village Kids\n3:18 Kula The Korok\n3:36 Compendium Korok\n4:06 Armor Limit Interactions\n4:41 Vilia With Armor Limit\n5:04 Climbing Stamina Bug\n5:35 Equipment Development\n6:34 Weapon Elemental Pommels\n7:05 Zelda Error QA System", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0La8WLv28qI", "date_published": "2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "19 Things I Wish I Knew About DMZ In Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2", "description": "How to succeed at COD: M2 2\u2019s\u00a0 DMZ, including faction missions, collecting blueprints, strongholds, secrets, and best starting weapons.\u00a0\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has a sandbox mode called DMZ, where you can find many of the game's challenges and rare blueprints. The mode is different from the battle royale-focused Warzone 2.0 in that players can but aren\u2019t forced to fight one another. You drop in, complete faction missions, chase rare blueprints and secrets or a weapon case, and collect gear to extract with. Leveling up faction missions opens up new protected weapon slots; otherwise, you lose all of your gear when you die.\u00a0\n\nUltimately there\u2019s a lot to learn in this mode and plenty of tips, tricks, and lesser-known techniques to escape, like a contract-based extraction option. So far, players have found ways to get a few high-value items like the M13 B from killing The Chemist in radiation zones, as well as the seven rewards for extracting the Weapon Case, including the Caution Tape RPK Weapon and Biohazard operator skin.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to give you 18 rapid-fire tips to succeed, which include what to pursue when starting off, how to extract, and when, how to ask more players to join you if your squad leaves, and how to be a team player by grabbing items like the medical pistol, 2-3 plate armor, and an ammo crate to give to your squad. We\u2019ll cover the lesser-known extraction option with hostage rescue missions and what to pursue when starting off, like collecting junk and selling it at buy stations to purchase Stronghold key cards. If you die and suffer the two-hour cooldown on your protected weapon slot, we\u2019ll show you how to reduce that time, such as extracting with expensive loot or finding dumpsters to deposit cash into.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll cover some tips on how to find other players if you want to PvP and how to give yourself a better chance of not getting jumped. We\u2019ll also cover some more obscure tips like reviving squadmates underwater, refueling vehicles while moving with gas cans, some good controller settings, and even how to attempt stealth.\u00a0\n\nInfinity Ward\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. It includes Battle Maps, core and competitive multiplayer, Warzone 2.0, Spec Ops, and DMZ, with Raids still coming at a later date.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:22 - Know What You Want\n01:15 - You\u2019re Not Stuck Being Alone\n01:33 - How To Be A Buddy!\n01:51 - There\u2019s A Secret Extraction Option\n02:17 - First Things To Do (Junk and Armor)\n02:59 - The Bigger Rewards\n04:09- Exit Strategy\n04:30 - Best Gun On The Ground - RPK\n04:53 - Pack Extra Ammo\n05:06 - Dumpster Dive\n05:29 - You Can Interrogate In DMZ\n05:52 - You Can Refuel While Moving\n06:19 - Gun Farmer\n06:58 - Die Underwater Like A Champ\n07:24 - Don\u2019t Wait For It\n07:57 - How To Tell Other Players Apart\n08:42 - Settings\n09:39 - Stealth\n10:09 - Protect The Extract\n\n#dmz #warzone2 #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg3m6JFfE34", "date_published": "2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Evil West Review", "description": "Evil West's kinetic combat thrills as you dismember vampires by the bucket load, but it's dragged down by level design that's both formulaic and repetitive. \n\nRichard Wakeling takes us through his thoughts on Evil West, the new game from developer Flying Wild Hog.

Additionally, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will get ray-tracing, ambient occlusion, and other graphical features. These won't come to the less powerful Series S, but it does have 30fps and 60fps options to choose from.\nOn PS5, The Witcher 3 will use the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, so players will \"feel\" the action when they smack and enemy with a sword or perform magic. There will also be a new special mode where players can hold L2 and use face buttons to cast signs instead of needing to access the radial menu each time.\n\nContent inspired by Netflix's Witcher TV show is coming to The Witcher 3 as well, including swords based on what Henry Cavill wielded during Season 1 and Season 2. What's more, cross-progression is coming to The Witcher 3, so players can switch between platforms more easily going forward.\nThe new update arrives on December 14 alongside the Complete Edition, which includes the base game, all DLC, and the two major expansions: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. At launch, the Complete Edition will be digital-only, but a physical version is coming later.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbg7q107oLo", "date_published": "2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Next Gen Update Official Trailer", "description": "The free next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X on December 14th, 2022!
