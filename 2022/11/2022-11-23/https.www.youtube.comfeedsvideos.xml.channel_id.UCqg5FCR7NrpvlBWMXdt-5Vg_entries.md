This week on Breakout we're taking about season passes and The Callisto Protocol specifically locking down content for a linear single player game...

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
