For the CCP, it is a natural policy to support North Korea's nuclear and missile development and to cooperate with the Kim regime in order to keep the U.S. in check. 
If we look at the history of the CCP's own development of nuclear weapons, it will shed light on its logic and values. The CCP doesnâ€™t have the interests of China or the Chinese people at heart but rather its own separate interest. Its self-interest is to maintain its dominance and to promote its ideology to the world so that it can control the lives and future of more people on this planet. One of the major reasons why the Chinese Communist regime dares to challenge and even threaten the U.S. today is its possession of nuclear weapons.
