00:00 Introduction
00:25 Study on privacy
01:17 There is no excuse for these shops looking through customer data
02:14 Why their privacy policy take pisses me off
02:40 My "privacy policy"
03:20 How this works - what we do
03:29 Oreo the cat
03:30 Back to how this works - what we do
04:06 I dislike giving people a false sense of security
05:30 Why a privacy policy/legal notice isn't enough
06:10 Privacy can never be gotten back via a lawsuit resulting from a privacy policy violation
06:40 NEVER give unencrypted data to someone you do not fully trust, regardless of privacy policy
07:04 An example of a violation & what I mean when I say you will never be made whole again
09:45 Example of useless privacy policies from Apple
10:16 What were the RATINGS of the stores?
10:38 What happened to Sunny?
10:48 What were the RATINGS of the stores?
12:05 I want to be able to tell people how to know what shops toa void
12:48 My secret shoppers differ from here on a key point.
13:30 The wankery of "controls"
15:40 The "process"
16:30 Codes of ethics
17:23 Procedures and controls
18:01 Ask why info is needed, and communicate it to customers
18:10 Why techs ask for your password
19:24 The cold, hard truth
19:48 More cold hard truth
20:34 What areas was this study done in?
20:44 What are we actually controlling/testing for?
21:13 How is this different from CBC secret shopper on genius bar?
22:24 What I hope you learn from this
22:46 How I would handle my personal repairs
