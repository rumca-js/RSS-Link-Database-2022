[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Meme Dialects", "description": "<p><span>\n\nWhen I started at Google about ten years ago I was surprised to learn\nthat image macros (\"memes\") were very popular internally. There was a\npage for creating, sharing, voting on, and discussing them, \"Memegen\"\n[1], and it was rare for someone to give a presentation without\nincluding some.  My initial reaction was pretty negative: my earlier\nexposure to memes has been low-quality jokes in places where they\ntended to crowd out better discussion.  In this context, however, they\nweren't actually crowding other things out, and instead Memegen's\nlisting for highly-upvoted memes provided one of the best overviews of\ncompany-internal news.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nMemes often make heavy use of shared context.  Initially this was\nbroader culture, but well-known previous memes feed back into cultural\nreferences available to draw on, and you get the beginnings of a\nlanguage.  For example, an image of a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/scumbag-steve\">guy with an ugly\nbrown cap</a> became a standard way of talking about a particular kind\nof selfish or unreliable behavior.  Each meme using that image\nreinforces and expands the association, increasing how much you can\ncommunicate by using it as the background for another meme.  The hat\nis recognizable enough on its own that people will draw on those\nassociations by pasting the hat in other contexts.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWith tens of thousands of people creating and sharing Google-internal\nmemes for over a decade, the internal associations from past memes\ndiverged from external ones.  Not entirely, since people weren't cut\noff from the outside world, but in a way much like a dialect.  As\nsomeone who's read ~hundreds more Google-dialect memes than\ngeneral-internet ones, this is something I need to think about when I\n(as I very occasionally do) make memes.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFor example, remembering an old 80,000 Hours <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/\">article</a>\nand thinking about the <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/if-professional-investors-missed-this\">FTX collapse</a> I put\nsomething together for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/OMfCT\">EA memes FB group</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sbf-show-me-the-harm-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sbf-show-me-the-harm.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI selected and adapted the image of Bankman-Fried at the bottom to\nresemble the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/challenge-accepted\">\"challenge\naccepted\" stick figure</a> that is standard in the general internet\ndialect:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/challenge-accepted-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/challenge-accepted.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis felt a bit like speaking a foreign language, however, since (per\nmemory, can't check anymore) inside Google people would normally use\nvariants of this image of someone drinking beer:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lazy-college-senior-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lazy-college-senior.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nUntil yesterday, however, I didn't know that on the broader internet\nthat image has associations of <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lazy-college-senior\">burned-out\ncollege students</a>.  I'm glad I realized this before editing a pint\ninto a picture of Bankman-Fried to make a meme that wouldn't have made\nmuch sense to people who don't share my dialect!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis makes me wonder what other ways the dialect I've ended up with\ndiffers from the general-internet one.  Perhaps this could make a good\npaper for a relaxed linguistic department (ex: <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/final-papers/thesis/contra-thesis-1-0-0.pdf\">pdf</a>)?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] Created by my former Google Cambridge coworkers <a href=\"https://www.mcmillen.dev/\">McMillen</a> and <a href=\"https://mrfeinberg.com/\">Feinberg</a>.
