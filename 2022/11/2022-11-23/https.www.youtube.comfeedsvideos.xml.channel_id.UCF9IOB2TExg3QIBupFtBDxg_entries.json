anyone\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext\n\nWe are public health scientists who have closely followed the emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n\nand are deeply concerned about its impact on global health and wellbeing. \n\nWe stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/S41591-020-0820-9\n\nOur analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.\n\nConclusion\n\nObtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins. \n\n(Fully formed or evolutionary intermediate)\n\n\nUK experts helped shut down Covid lab leak theory \n\n- weeks after being told it might be true\n\nSir Patrick Vallance among scientists behind paper that stifled debate into the origins of the virus\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/11/23/uk-experts-helped-shut-covid-lab-leak-theory-weeks-told-might/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpZz9rCz3Co\n\nTop scientists including Sir Patrick Vallance,\n\nWere warned that virus could have evolved in lab animals\n\nCollaborated in above paper \n\nDebate therefore stifled\n\nTo date\n\nProximal origins paper\n\nAccessed more than 5.7 million times and cited in 2,627 subsequent papers. \n\nEmails from early 2020 \n\nFoI request, James Tobias, freelance journalist\n\nAuthors held lengthy discussions with experts, Sir Patrick and Sir Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust\n\nWarned WIV had been carrying out research on bat-coronaviruses,\n\nat worrying levels of biosecurity.\n\nResearch to alter Sars-like bat coronaviruses had been taking place for many years in Wuhan\n\n(not mentioned in paper)\n\nSir Jeremy Farrar, (Wellcome)\n\nWuhan was like the \"Wild West\".\n\nProf Kristian Andersen, Scripps Research Institute La Jolla, California (lead author)\n\nhad earlier told colleagues that features of the virus looked as if they\u2019d been engineered in a lab.\n\n(No mention of this was made in the paper)\n\nDr Jeremy Farrar, (Wellcome)\n\nIt is important that we understand how all pathogens emerge so that we can prevent future pandemics\n\nas the efforts to gather evidence continue, it is important to stay open-minded\n\nSerial passaging\n\nWould cause the virus to contain o-glycans\n\nThe second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) at the junction of S1 and S2 \n\nProf Ron Fouchier, Dutch virologist\n\n(from another e mail chain)\n\nIt is good that this possibility was discussed in detail with a team of experts. \n\nHowever, further debate about such accusations would unnecessarily distract top researchers from active duties,\n\nand do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular\n\nFebruary 8th e mail Prof Edward Holmes\n\n(one of the authors)\n\nEver since this outbreak started there have been suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab, \n\nif only because of the coincidence of where the outbreak occurred and the location of the lab.\n\nI do a lot of work in China and I can tell you a lot of people there believe this and believe they are being lied to\n\nProf Kristian Andersen, February 8th\n\n(Lead author)\n\nPassage of Sars-live coronaviruses have been going on for several years and more specifically in Wuhan under BSL-2 conditions\n\nBSL-2 laboratories are used to study moderate-risk infectious agents or toxins such as salmonella. \n\nSerious diseases should be handled in BSL-3 or 4 labs.\n\nWuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)\n\nImporting bat coronaviruses from areas of China which hold the closest viruses to Covid-19\n\nHad also applied for funding to manipulate viruses by inserting a furin cleavage site (FCS)\n\nThe email chain\n\nInvolved Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), \n\nan organisation which was funding research at the Wuhan lab.\n\nSenate report on viral origins\n\nthe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that
