This week on Breakout we're taking about the price point of PSVR 2 and why we think it will be dead on arrival. We've also been playing a bunch of the latest releases, as our backlogs re-fill as we head towards the end of the year.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
