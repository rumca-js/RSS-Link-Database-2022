Thanks to HP for sponsoring this video! you can learn more about the HP 845 G9 at: https://bit.ly/3ztZIJp

For years, there’s been an unfriendly trend of replacing socketed, swappable components like RAM and SSDs for ones that come soldered to the motherboard. Great for keeping device thickness to a minimum, but not so great for reparability. Let’s see what HP did to buck that trend.
