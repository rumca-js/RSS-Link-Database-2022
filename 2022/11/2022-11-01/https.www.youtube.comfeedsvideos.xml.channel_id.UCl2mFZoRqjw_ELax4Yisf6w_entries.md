If selected, each member of your team will receive at least $20,000 of funding, airfare to Austin, free housing for three months, incubator space, equipment, mentorship, and VIP invites to a full slate of events.

Applicants are asked to email a CV and 500â€“1000 word description of their project to grantapps@futo.org. Shortlisted candidates will be invited to interview with FUTO staff at our Austin offices or, if the candidate is outside Central Texas, via video chat. Please apply by 2023 Jan 1.

Here are some questions weâ€™ll be asking to judge applicants:

1.    What is your project? Provide a link to more detailed information if it exists.
2.    How will your project reduce the harm that the Tech Oligopoly inflicts upon the people?
3.    How and when do you expect to publish the work resulting from your project?
4.    What have you finished or accomplished so far?
5.    Who is the target user of your work?
6.    What do you plan to do with copyrights and patents resulting from your project?
7.    How will you measure the success of your project? Please be as specific as possible.
8.    How would you rate your chances of success?
9.    What resources can the FUTO organization provide to assist?
10.    What resources have you been provided before if any, and from what donors?

Best of luck to all applicants!
