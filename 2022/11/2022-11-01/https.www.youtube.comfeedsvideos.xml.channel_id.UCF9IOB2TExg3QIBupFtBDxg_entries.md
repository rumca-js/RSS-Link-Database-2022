We should never ever have had a pandemic preparedness team that did not consider the indirect and long-term effects. 

We focussed on the direct effects of excess deaths from covid,

but from the beginning it’s likely the indirect effects will lead to more deaths, 

and more morbidity and more economic impacts than Covid deaths itself

What I see is still a focus on the direct effects of Covid

Nobody who is in charge of the NHS, or any of the new health secretaries, are making any noises about it

## Covid could have started earlier than thought

Just when did the covid virus start spreading around the world?

Section III

China’s early COVID-19 Vaccine Development versus the U.S. Operation Warp Speed 

Full genetic sequence, SARS-CoV-2

First posted, global virus database, January 11, 2020

Chinese professor, violated government restrictions

Then

Vaccine developers inserted viral genome into cells to produce viral proteins

Preclinical animal toxicity 

Safety and efficacy studies 

Human clinical safety and efficacy trials

Commercial scale vaccine production. 

Operation Warp Speed

Pre OWS work started on January 11, 2020

E.g. Adenovirus vector vaccines

The AstraZeneca-Oxford, went from sequence to phase I clinical trials in 103 days

(Ebola platform)

J and J was 185 days

Three adenovirus vector vaccines

Pfizer trail started 7th May 2020

Another Chinese vaccine was patented on 24th February 2020 

(Brigadier General Yusen Zhou, Academy of Military Medical Sciences)

Question

Did Chinese researchers have access to the genomic sequence before January 11, 2020? 

If so, how far in advance of January 11, 2020?

In the case of Pfizer

Submitted a clinical trial that started in 14th January 2020

Three days later Pfizer already started a test for these vaccines

Moderna

Trials since 2017

Coincidence or not a coincidence?
