And they\u2019re ready to face the end of the world together, or at least I hope they are. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about God of War Ragnarok.\n#Gaming #GodofWarRagnarok #GameSpot\n\nGod of War Ragnarok takes place a few years after the events of God of War 2018. According to Sony, Atreus is desperately curious and \u201clike most young people, he wants to understand who he is more than anything. In this case, he wants to understand who he could be. The mystery of Loki's role in the upcoming conflict is something that Atreus cannot let go of.\u201d\n\nThat conflict is the looming threat of Ragnarok, a prophesied battle that will end the world and Sony continued by saying \u201cAtreus also doesn't want to stand by and do nothing while conflict consumes the Nine Realms.\n\ns for Kratos, Sony says he is intent on helping to spare Atreus from the \"bloody lessons he learned from his conflict with gods.\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve never played the games that came before 2018\u2019s release then let me just say, this man\u2019s hands get VERY dirty. We have a complete God of War timeline video available to watch if you need a refresher. For now, back to Ragnarok. \n\nIn order to find the answers they seek, Kratos and Atreus will journey to each of the Nine Realms facing off against a variety of Norse gods and monsters while exploring stunning mythical landscapes. \n\nRagnarok will wrap up this Norse chapter of the franchise, as Sony Santa Monica wanted to avoid having this portion of the story from getting too unwieldy.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H2rYcqyNqU", "date_published": "2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PSVR 2 Is More Expensive Than A PS5 | GameSpot News", "description": "PSVR 2 gets a massive price tag, Modern Warfare 2 runs into more issues, and It Takes Two developer teases the team\u2019s next game.

All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nSony has revealed the launch date and price of the upcoming PSVR 2. The good news is the device is releasing very soon. The bad news is that it will cost you more than a PS5.\n\nOn February 22 2023, the PSVR 2 will release for $550, which is $50 more than the PS5 with a disk drive and $150 more than the digital only PS5. Sony will also sell a Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle that comes with the system and the game for $600, while the PSVR 2 Sense controller charging station will be offered on its own for $50.\n\nPSVR 2 will be available to preorder starting November 15 from Sony's online store at direct.playstation.com for shoppers in the US, UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Preorder registration opens today, November 2.\n\nIn addition to the release date and pricing announcement, Sony revealed a bunch more games you\u2019ll be able to play on the system at launch.\n\nIn the vein of its previous VR title Until Dawn: Rush of Blood that came out for the first PS VR, developer Supermassive will be releasing a similar experience under its more recent Dark Pictures banner; a horror game subtitled Switchback VR that, like Rush of Blood, is a first person shooter on a rollercoaster.\n\nIn addition, shooter franchise Crossfire is coming to the device with Sierra Squad, the popular VR title Pistol Whip is being ported over, and the Cities series is getting a VR installment. For more info on all the titles announced, head to the link in the description.\n\nOn the PC side of gaming life, a Steam feature that was available at Modern Warfare 2\u2019s launch has since been disabled. \n\nFor the unfamiliar, family sharing is a Steam feature that lets family and friends have access to games on your account. Any account can share a game with up to five other accounts, but there are some restrictions. The digital copy is essentially shared between accounts, so two players cannot play at the same time on different PCs. The feature is activated at the discretion of the game publisher and there is an option to turn it off or on in the Steam backend.\n\nWhile the game launched with this enabled, a listing on SteamDB states the feature was turned off on Halloween, preventing some players who had access to the game from playing further.\n\nActivision has yet to make an official comment, but users have speculated that family sharing can enable cheaters to avoid bans. Regardless, members of the Call of Duty community are generally unhappy with the change, citing the high price tag of the game and the desire to let other members of their household or family play without buying a second copy.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:12 - PSVR 2 https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reveals-a-bunch-of-new-psvr-2-games/1100-6508821/\n01:42 - Modern Warfare 2 Steam family sharing disabled\n02:51 - Josef Fares talks Hazelight's next game", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdUxpZKJJXM", "date_published": "2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sonic Frontiers Everything To Know", "description": "Sonic is back with a bold new direction in Sonic Frontiers. Sonic Frontiers takes cues from modern open world games to create something both familiar and all new for Sonic. So, here is everything you need to know about Sonic Frontiers.\n#Gaming #SonicFrontiers #GameSpot\n\nBrand new to Sonic with Sonic Frontiers is a skill tree. Fallen enemies now drop skill pieces Sonic can collect and use to upgrade his skills. Not only that, but Sonic will be able to upgrade his stats by collecting red seeds of power and blue seeds of defense. These seeds can be found by completing puzzles and sidequests in the open zones. These puzzles can also unlock new areas of the map.\n\nCombat is another new feature to Sonic Frontiers. While Sonic will maintain his classic skill of a homing attack, he\u2019ll also have a drop dash and stomp attack, be able to slide at any point, and boost his speed on ground or mid-air. Not only that, but Sonic can now attack with his fists in melee combat, perform combos, and use the brand new skill tree to level up these skills.\n\nCyloop sees you run in a circle around an enemy while activating this ability in order to break enemy\u2019s shields and guards, then have an opening to get in attacks. Cyloop can also be used to quickly collect rings after getting hit by an enemy.\n\nSonic can also now both parry enemy attacks and dodge. Parrying allows Sonic to use this window to counter-attack. Meanwhile, dodging at the right time briefly slows down the time allowing Sonic to get in more attacks.\n\nIncluded in Sonic\u2019s new skillset is a meter that will fill up during combos, and when high enough, allows Sonic to perform a Phantom Rush - which boosts Sonic\u2019s attack power until the meter drops back to 0.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzaitdJKk0", "date_published": "2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "God of War Ragnaro\u0308k | 4K Parents Trailer with Ben Stiller, LeBron James, and John Travolta", "description": "What could real parents learn from the relationship between Kratos and Atreus?

To celebrate the launch of God of War Ragnarok, let\u2019s take a look at the history of the series.\n#GodOfWar #Ragnarok #GameSpot #gaming \n\nKratos is a PlayStation icon and has been since the God of War franchise launched in 2005. Over the years, he's overcome many trials and tribulations, had a lot of family issues, and hacked and slashed his way through all manner of Greek gods, titans, and monsters. But the series, known for its over-the-top nature, toned things down a little with God of War (2018), telling a more mature story about a father, his son, and breaking a cycle of violence that had plagued Kratos for ages. The story will reach its conclusion with Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok for PS4 and PS5, so we decided to take a look at each God of War game to see how far Kratos has really come. \nIn this video, we chart the history of the God of War franchise, from the game's initial pitch (Onimusha with Greek mythology, plus the puzzles of Ico and some adult themes thrown in for good measure) all the way up to the emotional hardships that Kratos and his son Atreus must face together in God of War (2018) and now Ragnarok. We discuss every mainline God of War game, including sequels, prequels, and even spinoffs, including the beloved Ghost of Sparta for the PSP and lesser-known games like God of War Betrayal or Mimir's Vision. \nFor more on God of War Ragnarok, including our review, features, and guides, make sure to subscribe to GameSpot on YouTube and check out gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 - Intro\n00:17 - God of War\n03:24 - God of War 2\n05:28 - God of War: Betrayal\n05:46 - God of War: Chains of Olympus\n06:28 - God of War 3\n08:28 - God of War: Ghost of Sparta\n09:22 - God of War: Ascension\n10:30 - God of War (2018)\n13:09 - God of War: Mimir\u2019s Vision\n13:24 - God of War: A Call from the Wilds\n13:40 - God of War Ragnar\u00f6k", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL7RmKq29KY", "date_published": "2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Steam Deck's Most Popular Title Coming to Xbox Game Pass | GameSpot News", "description": "One of Steam Deck\u2019s most popular games is coming to Game Pass, Modern Warfare 2 leak hints at much beloved mode returning, and Fortnite gets some crucial Star Wars skins. All on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n#Gaming #XboxGamePass #SteamDeck #ModernWarfare2 \n\nVampire Survivors, one of the most played games on Valve\u2019s Steam Deck, plays like an homage to Castlevania where you slowly gather power and turn your supernatural slayer into a mobile tornado of whips, cats, and garlic force-fields. It recently exited its early access phase and is now a full release, and has been exclusive to PC until today's Game Pass announcement confirming an Xbox console release on November 8. It's also currently on Xbox Game Pass for PC.\n\nReleased back in October, Return to Monkey Island features series creator Ron Gilbert back in the captain's chair and continues the story of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge. The game got a 9/10 score from GameSpot, with reviewer Richard Wakeling noting that it feels like a \"heartfelt and nostalgic adventure\" aimed at longtime fans of the series. The game is coming to Game Pass on November 10.\n\nPentiment is the other big game for the month, a medieval murder mystery with a distinct illustrated style from Obsidian Entertainment. The game unfolds over 25 years during early 16th century Germany, and the entire game looks like it was ripped from the pages of a manuscript from that time period. Pentiment comes to Game Pass on November 15.\n\nYou can find the full list of games announced for Game Pass this month in the description below.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has only been out for a few days, but players have already found a bug that allows you to see all of the emblems and calling cards in the game. The volume of alien-themed nameplates has led some players to believe that a Extinction-style mode may be coming to the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTfPXSe8oso", "date_published": "2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
