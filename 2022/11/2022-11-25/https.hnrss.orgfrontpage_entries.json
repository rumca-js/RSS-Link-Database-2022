It is an odd acronym, but I like it.<p>* Nostr uses websockets and relays to build a really simple P2P network. We also steal a few ideas from bitcoin (ECDSA ids, schnorr-signed events).<p>* Relays are simply dumb data stores for events that clients publish and subscribe to.<p>* Clients don't trust relays to be honest, so all events are self-signed. Your pubkey is your userid.<p>* It is stupid simple to build a Nostr client. You can easily do it in less than 400 lines of JavaScript. And it runs in the browser.<p>(shameless self plug)  \nhttps://github.com/cmdruid/nostr-emitter<p>* Nostr is powerful enough to host chat apps very easily. Here is a rip of Telegram, running on Nostr:<p>https://anigma.io<p>* There's a lot of fun things you can do with Nostr. Check out all these cool projects!<p>https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr<p>* We are constantly discussing how to improve the protocol. Come join the conversation here:<p>https://t.me/nostr_protocol  \nhttps://anigma.io  \nhttps://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips<p>Thank you for reading my nostr shill post. I did not create nostr, nor do I get any monies for promotion. I just think it's really cool and I have a lot of fun building stuff that punches though nats.<p>If you have any questions about nostr please feel free to ask.<p>Also, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! I hope we're all feeling fat and sassy today. :-D</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Check it out here: <a href=\"https://search.rye.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://search.rye.com/</a><p>Here\u2019s a blog that outlines how we built it and how you can to: <a href=\"https://blog.rye.com/a-beginners-guide-to-building-a-product-recommendation-engine-ed9968acbfb4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.rye.com/a-beginners-guide-to-building-a-product...</a><p>If you\u2019d like to build on it, we\u2019re also down to open source it for folks that want access.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744459\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744459</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://search.rye.com/", "date_published": "2022-11-25 17:06:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "DOJ will examine whether RealPage helped landlords coordinate rent increases", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-realpage-rent-doj-investigation-antitrust\">https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-realpage-rent-doj-investigation-antitrust</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744136\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744136</a></p>\n<p>Points: 40</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "link": "https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-realpage-rent-doj-investigation-antitrust", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:42:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hurl, run and test HTTP requests with plain text", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl\">https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744106\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744106</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:40:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hurl: Run and test HTTP requests with plain text", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://hurl.dev/\">https://hurl.dev/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744106\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33744106</a></p>\n<p>Points: 37</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://hurl.dev/", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:40:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Black Friday Deals (macOS apps, SaaS, Books, Courses, etc.)", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/trungdq88/Awesome-Black-Friday-Cyber-Monday\">https://github.com/trungdq88/Awesome-Black-Friday-Cyber-Monday</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743994\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743994</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://github.com/trungdq88/Awesome-Black-Friday-Cyber-Monday", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:32:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Coding Curves", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2022/11/coding-curves/\">https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2022/11/coding-curves/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743945\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743945</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2022/11/coding-curves/", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:28:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Keep the Internet free and open (2012)", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/keep-internet-free-and-open/\">https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/keep-internet-free-and-open/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743923\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743923</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/keep-internet-free-and-open/", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:27:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Stripe is wrongly suspending accounts", "description": "<p>context: We are a SaaS for martial arts academies located in Europe. We are using Stripe for our payment integrations and all our academies have their own account connected to our platform using Stripe Connect (standard), since the last couple of days 2 accounts have been suspended due to \"suspicious activity\".<p>Stripe has implemented a new fraud detection system that is clearly flawed here. These customers are small gyms in local areas with accounts active for the last 11 months without no issues whatsoever, now all of a sudden they were both suspended (and payout blocked) due to suspicious activity. The suspicious activity is disputed payments, which for SEPA DD (the main payment method used) can simply be that the customer has no money in the bank account.<p>The Stripe response so far has been vague, to say the least. Has this happened to you?<p>I believe Stripe is a very good product and we have had no issue with them until now, but this situation is deteriorating trust very fast. Do they literally have the power of taking your funds hostage over a \"suspicious\" fraudulent activity that is clearly due to a bug in their automatic detection system?<p>Please let me know if you know someone that can help us here</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743750\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743750</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33743750", "date_published": "2022-11-25 16:14:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Azure has run out of compute.

right contact and/or may have technical suggestions as to what to do next as I think I am facing a unique (I think) issue with my Facebook account.<p>I haven't been on Facebook for more than a year now. For some reason, today, I decided to send some messages and lo and behold my password wouldn't work. I am reasonably confident that I have not forgotten the password. After a few tries, I did what any sane person would do - hit the 'forget password' workflow. OK, I got the recovery code and all and was able to reset and log in. And this is where things got a bit weird.<p>Facebook dropped me onto a completely new profile. The email message I got subsequently said that they have \"reactivated an old account\".\nWhat is even weirder is that the two email addresses differ by a \"dot\". (Thank you gmail!)\nAnyone who uses gmail would know that dots don't matter in the address. So, if my original email, to which my OG account was linked was 'john.smith@gmail.com'; the new account has been created as 'johnsmith@gmail.com' - and no I did enter the dotted email as the recovery email. It doesn't seem to matter for facebook recovery process. The email I get is being sent to the one without dots and that email is linked to the new account now. This new account is now showing up for even the dotted email (If I try the forget password flow wherein it shows 'is this your account?')<p>I checked my OG profile and it does exist. Fortunately, I have one session still active for my OG account on chrome that I hadn't opened in a long time. I tried checking what email was listed on the account. It is blank!  I never gave my phone # to facebook. So, I have a situation wherein my OG account seems to have no email and no phone number on it. And any attempt to add those is asking for the old password - which is not working! I am kinda stuck!<p>I reported the new account as 'fake'; 'impersonating me' as there seemed to be no other option in facebook support to address this issue.\nDespite clearly indicating that it is an impersonation of me, facebook auto support says 'no community guidelines have been violated' and everything is kosher!<p>Well, no, it is not!<p>I am half inclined to just use this as a sign from powers above, and start deleting my photos etc. from the OG session I still have access to; and then deactivate both the accounts for good - but  was hoping I could fix it first. Does anyone have any real human contacts in Facebook who could help?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737727\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737727</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737727", "date_published": "2022-11-25 00:30:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Warning \u2013 Google suspended GCP services for 'verification', lost my business", "description": "<p>I operate multiple apps which were providing my entire livelihood, and I wake up one day to realize it's all gone.<p>Long story short, Google froze my Google Pay account which is used to pay for anything related to Google services, including GCP. This was done as they need to temporarily suspend me to 'verify' me. The GCP team couldn't help me since it was an issue with Google Pay. Not to mention their chat support is useless and doesn't have any power to look into cases.<p>Now I login to find out my Google Pay account is 'temporarily suspended' since I need to verify my account. I go ahead and add my drivers license and fill out their form, but while they verify details they suspend your ability to pay for any Google services.<p>So now I can't pay for GCP usage (firebase) and all my authentication, database, cloud functions, are all not usable since the service is suspended. Unlike Amazon who offers phone lines for resolving billing issues, Google does no such thing. I wish I chose AWS.<p>The end result is that I have apps I spent years of my life building and which currently feed me to only be rendered unusable because some AI at google thought my Google Pay needed additional verification.<p>My whole life has done a 180 in the past week. I feel like I'm a man with literally nothing to lose and I can't live with myself anymore. This hurts much more than losing a job for me.<p>Please stay far, far away from Google services of any kind. They are by far the worst of the big tech companies when it comes to developer support.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737577\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737577</a></p>\n<p>Points: 27</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33737577", "date_published": "2022-11-25 00:05:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
