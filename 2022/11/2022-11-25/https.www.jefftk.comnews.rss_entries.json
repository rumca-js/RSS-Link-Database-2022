[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "NEFFA Should Allow Small Children", "description": "<p><span>\n\nWhen I was little we would go to the </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.neffa.org/\">NEFFA festival</a> every year.  I loved\nseeing the dancing: contra dance, international, dance performances.\nI loved listening to the music: bands, performances, hallway jamming.\nI loved eating the cake the Lithuanian booth would sell.  My cousins\nwould come up from Philadelphia, and it was one of my favorite\nweekends of the year.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThose early experiences at NEFFA got me into an activity and a\ncommunity that has been a huge part of my life ever since.  I've been\na dancer, <a href=\"https://www.kingfisherband.com/\">musician</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/calling-my-first-family-dance\">caller</a>, and helped\norganize a <a href=\"https://www.bidadance.org/\">dance series</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.beantownstomp.com/\">weekend</a>.  I've been\nbringing my kids with me when I go early to set up for the dance and\nwhen I <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-dances-with-a-kid\">travel to play dances\nelsewhere</a>, and I'm glad they're getting to enjoy something that's\nbeen so important to me.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhich is why I was so disappointed to learn that the first in-person\nNEFFA since 2019 <a href=\"https://www.neffa.org/neffa-2023-festival-covid-19-policy/\">has\nchosen a covid policy that excludes small children</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nRegrettably, out of concern for everyone's safety, children who for\nwhatever reason are unable to remain appropriately masked as described\nabove, including those two years of age or younger, are not permitted\nto attend this year's Festival.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I described this policy to my cousin their response was \"I guess\nthat means we won't be able to go this year.\"  I think this will\nlikely be a common response among families with small children, and an\nunfortunate one.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHow seriously organizers and individuals should be trying to limit\ncovid spread is something there's a lot of disagreement on, mostly\ntracing back to different interpretations of the limited amount we\nknow about the long-term impacts of getting sick.  If the NEFFA\norganizers want to put on a very covid-cautious event that's not\nsomething I think people should give them grief over, and I'd <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/vaccine-requirements-age-and-fairness\">rather</a> see an\nin-person NEFFA for part of the community than no in-person event at\nall.  But while if the precautions under which they were able to hold\nthe event were uniformly strict I could see excluding people to young\nto mask, they aren't uniformly strict:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>There will be indoor dining, people eating and talking with\nmasks off.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Wind instruments are (likely&#8212;there's a case-by-case\ncomponent) allowed with same-day testing.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Despite rapid tests <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/dance-weekends-tests-not-masks\">now being</a> cheap and\nwidely available, they don't require them.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>They have an exception process for adults who are unable to be\nvaccinated for medical reasons.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI don't think these policy choices are terrible, but I also don't see\nhow they're compatible with a view that small children are too risky\nto allow.  I would like to encourage the NEFFA organizers to rethink\ntheir decisions here, and figure out whether there's a way to include\nthem safely.  For example, allowing them to attend with same-day rapid\ntesting, perhaps combined with distancing restrictions, like no\nbaby-in-carrier contra dancing?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPutting on a festival like NEFFA is a massive amount of work, and it's\nimpressive that NEFFA has managed this while continuing to be an\nall-volunteer organization.  There are a huge number of decisions\ninvolved in putting on an event of this scale, especially while\norganizing the first one in four years and at a new venue, and I don't\nexpect I'm going to agree with every single one.  Still, I think the\neffect this has on who can attend the festival is large enough and\nuneven enough that more discussion and consideration are needed.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0GUSBkcYjtLV9vQv73j6PxLbfxv8Fim1oArLqhJxjC8991bRUT6zBpXSiWUUaquMjl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/ghYEgCWJ69oyn3FPL\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109406925763338942\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/neffa-should-allow-small-children", "date_published": "2022-11-25 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
