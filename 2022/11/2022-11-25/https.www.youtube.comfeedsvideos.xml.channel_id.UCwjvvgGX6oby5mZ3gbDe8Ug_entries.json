The Chinese men's soccer team failed to enter the Game. Yet, the Chinese government and its central media outlets took the opportunity, that is a globally watched sporting event, to praise the \"omnipresence of Chinese elements in the World Cup\", hoping to cultivate and inspire patriotism or love for the party.  But this propaganda campaign has provoked a lot of public resentment.\nSpeaking of corruption, a news story recently broke out. On November 12th, 2022, it was revealed that Li Tie, the former head coach of the Chinese men's soccer team, has been \"missing\" to this day. According to the Chinese newspaper \u201cFootball\u201d, the department that took Li away was the discipline inspection department of the General Administration of Sports.
