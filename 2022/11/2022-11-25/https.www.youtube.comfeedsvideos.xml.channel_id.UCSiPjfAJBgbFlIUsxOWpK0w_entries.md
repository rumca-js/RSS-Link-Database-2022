LYRICS
Buy it, use it, break it, fix it
Trash it, change it, mail â€“ upgrade it
Charge it, point it, zoom it, press it
Snap it, work it, quick â€“ erase it
Write it, cut it, paste it, save it
Load it, check it, quick â€“ rewrite it
Plug it, play it, burn it, rip it
Drag and drop it, zip â€“ unzip it
Lock it, fill it, call it, find it
View it, code it, jam â€“ unlock it
Surf it, scroll it, pause it, click it
Cross it, crack it, switch â€“ update it
Name it, rate it, tune it, print it
Scan it, send it, fax â€“ rename it
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Technologic

One more time
One more time

Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning, ooh
The force of love beginning

Weâ€™ve come too far
To give up who we are
So letâ€™s raise the bar
And our cups to the stars, hey

Weâ€™re up all night 'til the sun
Weâ€™re up all night to get some
Weâ€™re up all night for good fun
Weâ€™re up all night to get lucky

Weâ€™re all up night 'til the sun
Weâ€™re up all night to get some
Weâ€™re up all night for good fun
Weâ€™re up all night to get lucky

Weâ€™re up all night to get lucky
Weâ€™re up all night â€“ all night to get â€“ up all night to get, get, get lu-, lu-

Last night, I had this dream about you
In this dream, Iâ€™m dancing right beside you
Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with just a little bit of fun
We were dancing all night long

Oh, I donâ€™t know what to do
About this dream and you
I hope this dream comes true
One more time
Weâ€™re gonna celebrate
Oh yeah, all right
Letâ€™s start the dancing
One more time
Weâ€™re gonna celebra-a-a-a-ate

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour 
Work is never over

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour
Work is never over

Work it harder, make it bett-
Do it faster, makes us
More than ever hou-hour after hour
Wo-ork is never over

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour
Work is never over

Television, rules the nation, oh
Television, rules the nation

Musicâ€™s got me feeling so free
Celebrate and dance so free
One more time
Musicâ€™s got me feeling so free
Celebrate and dance so free

Weâ€™ve come too far
To give up who we are
So letâ€™s raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

Weâ€™re up all night till the sun
Weâ€™re up all night to get some
Weâ€™re up all night for good fun
Weâ€™re up all night to get lucky

Weâ€™re up all night till the sun
Weâ€™re up all night to get some
Weâ€™re up all night for good fun
Weâ€™re up for-

One more night
Celebration
Music's got me feeling so free, oh
One more-

Weâ€™re up all night till the sun
Weâ€™re up all night to get some
Weâ€™re up all night for good fun
Ooh, work is never over
