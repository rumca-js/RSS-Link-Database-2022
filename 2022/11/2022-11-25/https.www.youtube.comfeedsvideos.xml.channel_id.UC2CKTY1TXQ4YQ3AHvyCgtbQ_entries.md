You hear how you're not painting your miniatures right all the time - mostly from the Internet. But you're not.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
