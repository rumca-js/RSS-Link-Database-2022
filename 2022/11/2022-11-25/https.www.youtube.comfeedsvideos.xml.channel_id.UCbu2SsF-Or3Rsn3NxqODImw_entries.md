## Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Everything To Know

Warhammer 40K: Darktide is a first-person co-op shooter with gameplay similar to that of Warhammer Vermintide 2, developer Fatshark’s previous game.

At launch, you’ll have your pick of one of four classes. These include: 
The Verteran Sharpshooter, a class that specializes in ranged combat. Sharpshooters start the game with a Kantrael Mk VII Lasgun as well as a standard-issue munitorum sapper shovel in case they need to get up close and personal. This class is a good choice against Elites and special enemies, has increased ammo capacity and can slow their movement for increased weak spot damage, accuracy and handling. 

The Psyker Psykinetic, a class that can manipulate empyrean forces with their mind and use it to pop enemy skulls like balloons. Killing with this power, simply called Brain Burst, stores a Warp Charge that can be used to knock enemies away from them. However, Psykers are not just limited to their minds; they also get a Stub Revolver and a combat sword.  
The Zealot Preacher, a class that specializes in high-damage melee attacks: damage that increases based on their missing health. The Preacher is effective against armored enemies, has high melee attack speed, and can dash forward for the upper hand in combat. This class starts out with a combat axe as well as an autopistol. 

Lastly, there's The Ogryn Skullbreaker, another melee focused class with increased damage in that category. They’re good against hordes, effective at staggering and suppression, and can revive teammates faster. The Skullbreaker starts the game with a pipe club and a Thumper.

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will release on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store on November 30, 2022. The Xbox Series X|S version of the game does not have a release date at the time of this recording, however developer Fatshark stated the Xbox version “will launch shortly after PC.”
