But succeed it did, with many fans and critics (including GameSpot's own Tamoor Hussain, who awarded the game a 9/10) praising the ending, and the path Kratos and Atreus took to get there.\n\nGod of War Ragnarok's director, Eric Williams, joins Tamoor Hussain and Lucy James to discuss the game's ending at length, and we're not kidding when we tell you that this video contains spoilers. We discuss Tyr's important role in the game, Odin's plans and his relationship with his family, and that all important ending: Ragnarok itself. \n\nWe touch upon many other topics, including the death of a beloved character, Freya's role in the whole saga, and the ups and downs of parenthood. \n\nFor more God of War Ragnarok, make sure to check out some of our other videos, including our review, best tips, and more.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #spoilers #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmXln1nUN4E", "date_published": "2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "High on Life - 25 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Enjoy 25 Minutes of exploration and firefights with lots of foul-mouthed and zany characters in High On Life.

However, your Switch must be undocked, and you have to use a Joy-Con attached to the Switch, along with a wireless controller.\n\nAnother exploration glitch making its way around the internet is one that allows you to get up slopes that are impeding your progress.\u00a0\n\nZullieTheWitch on Twitter posted a clip of her Scarlet game. The video shows her attempting to jump up a slope and sliding down it. Then, she turns around and leaps up the hill backwards, successfully making it up. Our own attempts have gotten the trick to work. If you are interested in trying it yourself, the key is mashing the jump button as you descend, so that your jump starts before you begin to slide down.\n\nIn other Nintendo related news, the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass will soon be halfway to the finish line, as the third of six eight-course waves has been confirmed for a December 7 launch date.\n\nWave 3 of the Booster Course Pass will, like the previous waves, add eight more courses to the Mario Kart 8 roster, with all of them coming from previous games in the franchise. There's Wii Maple Treeway from Mario Kart Wii, DS Peach Gardens from Mario Kart DS and 3DS Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 7 just to name a few.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZTqjImeYKg", "date_published": "2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How Games Get Sniper Rifles Wrong - Loadout", "description": "Virtual sniping comes in such a spectrum of flavours, from Call of Duty quickscopes, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive AWP picks, to measuring your range and bullet drop in games like ARMA 3 and Sniper Elite 5.
