Peterson and Michael Franzese discuss being raised in a mafia environment, having a high-ranking father within the crime family, the schemes and successes of his career, and the ultimate reasons for why he walked away.\n \nMichael Franzese is an American former mobster once affiliated with the Colombo crime family. Most notable for his gas-tax scheme from the mid 80\u2019s, it is estimated that Franzese at one point was personally making eight million dollars a week. At his height Franzese had achieved the rank of Caporegime, or the equivalent of a captain or general within the mob ranks, and was nicknamed the \u201cYuppie Don\u201d as well as the \u201cPrince of the Mob,\u201d by his contemporaries. In 1986, Franzese was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy charges, and despite being released early, spent the next decade in and out of jail. In 1994 he was finally released, chose to retire from crime, and bought an estate in Florida. Since then he has traveled the world as a public speaker, and has written many books about his life and crimes, such as 1992\u2019s Quitting the Mob, or his most recent 2022 publication, Mafia Democracy. \n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Michael Franzese\n\nMichael Franzese on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xuh0pSLRLhzWGUnpOlvXw\nOn Twitter https://twitter.com/MichaelFranzese?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/michaelfranzese_/?hl=en\n\nMichael\u2019s newest book, Mafia Democracy https://www.amazon.com/Mafia-Democracy-Republic-Became-Racket/dp/1544530811\n\nFranzese Wine https://franzesewine.com/ \n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n \nMasterworks - \nInvest in art today with Masterworks at http://masterworks.art/jbp.\nSee important disclosures at https://masterworks.com/cd.\n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:23) Intro\n(3:28) Raised in the Mafia\n(11:25) Early exposure to violence\n(13:00) A father behind bars\n(14:00) The five families, Lucky Luciano\n(16:00) Racketeers and gangsters\n(18:00) The infamous gas-tax scheme\n(21:58) Keeping cool under intense pressure\n(25:15) When your father is the mob, Sonny Franzese\n(33:00) A dangerous meeting\n(43:45) Why we romanticize criminality\n(45:45) Responsibility and change\n(49:00) When Family Breaks\n(58:22) Turning points, Miami Gold Films\n(1:04:40) Love, the mafia, and God\n(1:11:30) 29 months of solitary confinement\n(1:14:00) Divine intervention\n(1:22:56) Christ and loyalty\n(1:30:24) The need for a new mindset\n(1:32:13) Showing change through action\n(1:36:27) Illegal versus immoral \n(1:39:00) White lies, living in truth\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #michaelfranseze #crime #mob #boss #mafia #newyork #NYC #manhattan", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzKM-VwriK0", "date_published": "2022-11-03 15:01:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
