In late August, Atlanta-based band Manchester Orchestra visited the Upper Midwest, where they performed as part of The Current’s Music on-a-Stick show at the Minnesota State Fair Grandstand. The show was notoriously cut short due to a sudden burst of severe weather, but not before Manchester Orchestra got in a good chunk of their set. 

Earlier in the day, Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull and Robert McDowell visited the MPR booth — aka Camp MPR — near the corner of Judson and Nelson, where they played acoustic versions of a couple of their songs. 

Songs performed:
00:00:00 Bed Head
00:03:58 The Gold 

Band members
Andy Hull - vocals, guitar
