Using a 3D model of Bucha, intercepted phone conversations of Russian soldiers and hundreds of hours of surveillance footage, the joint investigation shows, for the first time, what a cleansing operation looks like.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

When they eventually left in early April, what they left behind was evidence of a massacre, the scale of which had not previously been understood. \n\nTo analyze the patterns of violence that resulted in the deaths of over 450 people, The Associated Press and FRONTLINE collaborated with Situ Research who used drone footage from a Ukrainian citizen research group, Jus Talionis, to build a 3D model of Bucha illustrating the scale of alleged war crimes committed there by Russian forces.\n \nThis video is part of an AP/FRONTLINE investigation that includes the \u201cWar Crimes Watch Ukraine\u201d interactive experience and the documentary \u201cPutin\u2019s Attack on Ukraine: Documenting War Crimes.\u201d\n\n#BreakingNews #FRONTLINE #Ukraine\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
