This is the most secret bank in the world. Called the "Istituto per le Opere di Religione", or the Institute for the Works of Religion, the IOR has secrets and mystery that go back more than a century. And controversies that still abound today.

Created in the 1940s, its history actually goes back much further to the founding of the Vatican itself in 1929. An event that had much to do about money, that was helped along via donations of cash and land from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Since then, the Church's secret bank has done all it can to hide its financial dealings over the years.

Today, the Catholic Church has said that it wants to do all it can to change the sordid history of the Vatican bank. However, as you'll see in the video, it seems like not all its strange dealings are behind it.

I'd love to hear your thoughts below.
