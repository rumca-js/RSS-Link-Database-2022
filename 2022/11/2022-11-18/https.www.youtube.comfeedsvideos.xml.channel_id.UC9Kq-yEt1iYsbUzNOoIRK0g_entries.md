After the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler and Marvel found themselves in the difficult position of continuing an iconic and culturally important series without its main star. The result is Black Panther: Wakanda Foreverâ€“ a lovely tribute to Boseman, but not without some Marvel-ness to poke fun at!

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever does raise some questions. Like how do you actually pronounce NAMOR? How is this guy getting in and out of Wakanda so easily? Why would they go fight the ocean people on their home turf? Is everybody Iron Man now?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever!
