I had this video lying around on my hdd (well, SSD nowadays ofc :). Xigmatek was a well known Crysis modder i believe. He had a Youtube channel where i think i downloaded this from - it was so long ago i can't be sure. I couldn't find this video on Youtube anymore. So here it is. Reupload quality is what it is (the file i have is 720p mp4).

Many of his videos featured nice music, mostly made by him i think. This video features his "Awake to the Future" track.

(i'm not 100% sure, but music style and how it sounds like (mastering) gives me strong vibes that it could be him and not someone with the same name)

The Youtube channel currently named Xigmatek is not him.
