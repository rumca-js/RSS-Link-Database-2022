WHO seem to be on it already

From a doctor in Austria

It is currently a very emotional situation in my hospital 

(and in general in hospitals in Austria) 

because many of us in the health care sector are more or less forced to get a fourth vaccine dose. 

Even in my case as a physician who has received three doses and one infection just 6 months ago. 

The rule is that if the last vaccination is more than one year and/or the last infection is more than 6 months ago you either have to test all 72 hours or to get an additional vaccine dose; 

if not you are at risk of having to pay 500 to 3600 Euros and may even get fired.
