Tesla has been an objective success—moving from relative obscurity to the world’s most valuable automaker in less than a decade. Some of that was certainly Elon’s hutzpah, but most of it was their technology platform being leagues above the rest. Another automaker based out of California tried to beat Tesla to market. They made a decent car, had a good manufacturing partner, but hit the market at the wrong time with the wrong price. Today, we talk about CODA and the CODA EV—the failed family sedan competitor to the Tesla Model S.
