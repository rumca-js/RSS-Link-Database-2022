It was tasty, and after eating most of it I decided\nto make more.  This time I used a gallon of cider, and it wasn't done\nafter a day so I turned the slow cooker to \"low\" and left it\novernight.  Turns out that was too much!  It had reduced to about 1/10\nits original volume (1gal to 12oz), which wouldn't be too bad if I\nended up with caramel.  Except that it also has a decidedly burnt\nflavor, probably from getting too hot at the end.  I like dark\ncaramel, but this is past dark.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/burnt-apple-caramel-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/burnt-apple-caramel.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the plus side, it's fun to play with, a bit like silly putty:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anna-playing-with-burnt-caramel-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"509\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anna-playing-with-burnt-caramel.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe kids have told me I can't throw it out yet, but it probably goes\ntomorrow.  It's frustrating because the apple cider caramel flavors\nare all there, there's just also a persistent flavor of 'burnt'.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02NYdspzfkSpBD2AgVqpsLu6ptD5DBMaXkngEW5qf9gH4886aJU24zDFkVzjusXH5Fl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/gNBZJZCdzDWQDJsSn\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109401903142158233\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/less-successful-cider-adventures", "date_published": "2022-11-24 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
