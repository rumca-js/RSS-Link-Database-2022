Warhammer 40K: Darktide is a first-person co-op shooter with gameplay similar to that of Warhammer Vermintide 2, developer Fatshark’s previous game.

At launch, you’ll have your pick of one of four classes. These include: 
The Verteran Sharpshooter, a class that specializes in ranged combat. Sharpshooters start the game with a Kantrael Mk VII Lasgun as well as a standard-issue munitorum sapper shovel in case they need to get up close and personal. This class is a good choice against Elites and special enemies, has increased ammo capacity and can slow their movement for increased weak spot damage, accuracy and handling. 

The Psyker Psykinetic, a class that can manipulate empyrean forces with their mind and use it to pop enemy skulls like balloons. Killing with this power, simply called Brain Burst, stores a Warp Charge that can be used to knock enemies away from them. However, Psykers are not just limited to their minds; they also get a Stub Revolver and a combat sword.  
The Zealot Preacher, a class that specializes in high-damage melee attacks: damage that increases based on their missing health. The Preacher is effective against armored enemies, has high melee attack speed, and can dash forward for the upper hand in combat. This class starts out with a combat axe as well as an autopistol. 

Lastly, there's The Ogryn Skullbreaker, another melee focused class with increased damage in that category. They’re good against hordes, effective at staggering and suppression, and can revive teammates faster. The Skullbreaker starts the game with a pipe club and a Thumper.

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will release on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store on November 30, 2022. The Xbox Series X|S version of the game does not have a release date at the time of this recording, however developer Fatshark stated the Xbox version “will launch shortly after PC.”

## 19 Things I Wish I Knew About DMZ In Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

How to succeed at COD: M2 2’s  DMZ, including faction missions, collecting blueprints, strongholds, secrets, and best starting weapons. 

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has a sandbox mode called DMZ, where you can find many of the game's challenges and rare blueprints. The mode is different from the battle royale-focused Warzone 2.0 in that players can but aren’t forced to fight one another. You drop in, complete faction missions, chase rare blueprints and secrets or a weapon case, and collect gear to extract with. Leveling up faction missions opens up new protected weapon slots; otherwise, you lose all of your gear when you die. 

Ultimately there’s a lot to learn in this mode and plenty of tips, tricks, and lesser-known techniques to escape, like a contract-based extraction option. So far, players have found ways to get a few high-value items like the M13 B from killing The Chemist in radiation zones, as well as the seven rewards for extracting the Weapon Case, including the Caution Tape RPK Weapon and Biohazard operator skin. 

In this video, we’re going to give you 18 rapid-fire tips to succeed, which include what to pursue when starting off, how to extract, and when, how to ask more players to join you if your squad leaves, and how to be a team player by grabbing items like the medical pistol, 2-3 plate armor, and an ammo crate to give to your squad. We’ll cover the lesser-known extraction option with hostage rescue missions and what to pursue when starting off, like collecting junk and selling it at buy stations to purchase Stronghold key cards. If you die and suffer the two-hour cooldown on your protected weapon slot, we’ll show you how to reduce that time, such as extracting with expensive loot or finding dumpsters to deposit cash into. 

We’ll cover some tips on how to find other players if you want to PvP and how to give yourself a better chance of not getting jumped. We’ll also cover some more obscure tips like reviving squadmates underwater, refueling vehicles while moving with gas cans, some good controller settings, and even how to attempt stealth. 

Infinity Ward’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. It includes Battle Maps, core and competitive multiplayer, Warzone 2.0, Spec Ops, and DMZ, with Raids still coming at a later date.
