A few weeks ago I made some </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/apple-cider-syrup">boiled
apple cider</a>.  It was tasty, and after eating most of it I decided
to make more.  This time I used a gallon of cider, and it wasn't done
after a day so I turned the slow cooker to "low" and left it
overnight.  Turns out that was too much!  It had reduced to about 1/10
its original volume (1gal to 12oz), which wouldn't be too bad if I
ended up with caramel.  Except that it also has a decidedly burnt
flavor, probably from getting too hot at the end.  I like dark
caramel, but this is past dark.

On the plus side, it's fun to play with, a bit like silly putty:

The kids have told me I can't throw it out yet, but it probably goes
tomorrow.  It's frustrating because the apple cider caramel flavors
are all there, there's just also a persistent flavor of 'burnt'.
