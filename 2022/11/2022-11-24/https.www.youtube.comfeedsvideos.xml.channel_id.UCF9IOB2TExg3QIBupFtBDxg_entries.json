who have closely followed the emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n\nand are deeply concerned about its impact on global health and wellbeing. \n\nWe stand together to strongly

Jolla, California (lead author)\n\nhad earlier told colleagues that features of the virus looked as if they\u2019d been engineered in a lab.\n\n(No mention of this was made in the paper)\n\nDr Jeremy

Fouchier, Dutch virologist\n\n(from another e mail chain)\n\nIt is good that this possibility was discussed in detail with a team of experts. \n\nHowever, further debate about such accusations would

authors)\n\nEver since this outbreak started there have been suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab, \n\nif only because of the coincidence of where the outbreak occurred and the
