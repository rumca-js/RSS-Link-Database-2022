These include: \nThe Verteran Sharpshooter, a class that specializes in ranged combat. Sharpshooters start the game with a Kantrael Mk VII Lasgun as well as a standard-issue munitorum sapper shovel in case they need to get up close and personal. This class is a good choice against Elites and special enemies, has increased ammo capacity and can slow their movement for increased weak spot damage, accuracy and handling. \n\nThe Psyker Psykinetic, a class that can manipulate empyrean forces with their mind and use it to pop enemy skulls like balloons. Killing with this power, simply called Brain Burst, stores a Warp Charge that can be used to knock enemies away from them. However, Psykers are not just limited to their minds; they also get a Stub Revolver and a combat sword.  \nThe Zealot Preacher, a class that specializes in high-damage melee attacks: damage that increases based on their missing health. The Preacher is effective against armored enemies, has high melee attack speed, and can dash forward for the upper hand in combat. This class starts out with a combat axe as well as an autopistol. \n\nLastly, there's The Ogryn Skullbreaker, another melee focused class with increased damage in that category. They\u2019re good against hordes, effective at staggering and suppression, and can revive teammates faster. The Skullbreaker starts the game with a pipe club and a Thumper.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide will release on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store on November 30, 2022. The Xbox Series X|S version of the game does not have a release date at the time of this recording, however developer Fatshark stated the Xbox version \u201cwill launch shortly after PC.\u201d\n\n#warhammer40k #gaming #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hfi58Lpiq8", "date_published": "2022-11-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "14 MORE Things You STILL Didn't Know In Zelda Breath Of The Wild", "description": "This time in Breath of the Wild, we show some secret NPC interactions when fighting powerful enemies, what happens when you hit the armor limit, and how climbing stamina actually works.\n\nShield Jump Cancels in the Combat Glossary-\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtYT06sxweRW3tRnovcCc-f4xIOGFNsD02pG1TzloHc/edit#bookmark=id.vgu1dn9i34s4\n\nVIDEO NOTES: In the video above, we cover 14 facts, tips and tricks that aren\u2019t quite as well known, ranging from secrets to glitches, so  me that are pretty simple and others that are fairly complex.

The mode is different from the battle royale-focused Warzone 2.0 in that players can but aren\u2019t forced to fight one another. You drop in, complete faction missions, chase rare blueprints and secrets or a weapon case, and collect gear to extract with. Leveling up faction missions opens up new protected weapon slots; otherwise, you lose all of your gear when you die.\u00a0\n\nUltimately there\u2019s a lot to learn in this mode and plenty of tips, tricks, and lesser-known techniques to escape, like a contract-based extraction option. So far, players have found ways to get a few high-value items like the M13 B from killing The Chemist in radiation zones, as well as the seven rewards for extracting the Weapon Case, including the Caution Tape RPK Weapon and Biohazard operator skin.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to give you 18 rapid-fire tips to succeed, which include what to pursue when starting off, how to extract, and when, how to ask more players to join you if your squad leaves, and how to be a team player by grabbing items like the medical pistol, 2-3 plate armor, and an ammo crate to give to your squad. We\u2019ll cover the lesser-known extraction option with hostage rescue missions and what to pursue when starting off, like collecting junk and selling it at buy stations to purchase Stronghold key cards. If you die and suffer the two-hour cooldown on your protected weapon slot, we\u2019ll show you how to reduce that time, such as extracting with expensive loot or finding dumpsters to deposit cash into.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll cover some tips on how to find other players if you want to PvP and how to give yourself a better chance of not getting jumped. We\u2019ll also cover some more obscure tips like reviving squadmates underwater, refueling vehicles while moving with gas cans, some good controller settings, and even how to attempt stealth.\u00a0\n\nInfinity Ward\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. It includes Battle Maps, core and competitive multiplayer, Warzone 2.0, Spec Ops, and DMZ, with Raids still coming at a later date.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:22 - Know What You Want\n01:15 - You\u2019re Not Stuck Being Alone\n01:33 - How To Be A Buddy!\n01:51 - There\u2019s A Secret Extraction Option\n02:17 - First Things To Do (Junk and Armor)\n02:59 - The Bigger Rewards\n04:09- Exit Strategy\n04:30 - Best Gun On The Ground - RPK\n04:53 - Pack Extra Ammo\n05:06 - Dumpster Dive\n05:29 - You Can Interrogate In DMZ\n05:52 - You Can Refuel While Moving\n06:19 - Gun Farmer\n06:58 - Die Underwater Like A Champ\n07:24 - Don\u2019t Wait For It\n07:57 - How To Tell Other Players Apart\n08:42 - Settings\n09:39 - Stealth\n10:09 - Protect The Extract\n\n#dmz #warzone2 #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg3m6JFfE34", "date_published": "2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Evil West Review", "description": "Evil West's kinetic combat thrills as you dismember vampires by the bucket load, but it's dragged down by level design that's both formulaic and repetitive. \n\nRichard Wakeling takes us through his thoughts on Evil West, the new game from developer Flying Wild Hog.
