In this video I take off my "Professional" hat and really call out where I think Meta's Metaverse has gone wrong- and right. This is not meant to be me trashing on Meta, but instead calling out where i think they can be better for the VR space.

Meta has recently laid off 11,000 employees, lost 70% of it's value within a year (a total of $700,000,000,000 of worth), and has had to cancel many projects- leading to Mark Zuckerberg apologizing that he "was wrong"

Really a lot of Meta's ambitions have been to artificially pump up sales of the Quest 2- which is fine, except it has resulted in their flagship platform becoming abandoned. So this video, whether you have a Quest 2, Quest, Rift, Index, or even if you don't have VR yet- lays down where they could be better in the future. 

I hope you enjoy. 

Much love

Also a new track as the outro, I hope you like it!
