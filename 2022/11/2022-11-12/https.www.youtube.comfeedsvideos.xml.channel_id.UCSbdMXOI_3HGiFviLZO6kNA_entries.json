This is not meant to be me trashing on Meta, but instead calling out where i think they can be better for the VR space.\n\nMeta has recently laid off 11,000 employees, lost 70% of it's value within a year (a total of $700,000,000,000 of worth), and has had to cancel many projects- leading to Mark Zuckerberg apologizing that he \"was wrong\"\n\nReally a lot of Meta's ambitions have been to artificially pump up sales of the Quest 2- which is fine, except it has resulted in their flagship platform becoming abandoned. So this video, whether you have a Quest 2, Quest, Rift, Index, or even if you don't have VR yet- lays down where they could be better in the future. \n\nI hope you enjoy. \n\nMuch love\n\nAlso a new track as the outro, I hope you like it!\n\nMy Links:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nMy discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/2hCGM9BYez\nPatreon link:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 THIS IS MY OPEN LETTER TO META\n01:03 THE GOOD STUFF\n03:08 WHERE DID IT GO SO WRONG?\n04:35 The REAL Problem at Meta \n07:53 WHY DID YOU KILL OCULUS?\n10:14 Quests are sitting on shelves collecting dust\n12:03 Looking back at the issues\n13:12 SO META- WATCH THIS \n15:49 \"Putting the \"Professional Hat\" Back on", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US"}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSbdMXOI_3HGiFviLZO6kNA", "title": "Thrillseeker"}}
