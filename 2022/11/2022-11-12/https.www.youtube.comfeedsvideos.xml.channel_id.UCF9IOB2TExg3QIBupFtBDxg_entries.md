Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

9,400 covid linked deaths last week

Almost 90% less than in February of this year

(February 2022, 75,000 a week, globally)

We have come a long way, and this is definitely cause for optimism. 

But we continue to call on all governments, communities and individuals to remain vigilant

Almost 10,000 deaths a week is 10,000 too many for a disease that can be prevented and treated

WHO continues to urge caution, and we continue to urge everyone to be fully vaccinated – including getting your next dose if it’s due.

Get all the recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine
Keep a safe distance from others, especially in closed spaces
When indoors, open windows if possible
Wear a mask if you’re or those around you are at high risk of severe illness
Keep hands clean
Cover coughs and sneezes
Stay home when feeling unwel

Shortening quarantine times, close contacts, inbound travellers

Seven days down to 5

Stop trying to identify "secondary" contacts

So

Five and a half more people registered with a GP than the total population

We also know there are millions in England not registered with a GP

Excess deaths AND long-term sickness dramatically increased in the UK

New Hope Children's Centre

This is a great organisation I have been involved with for 12 years now. I fully attest to the veracity and dedication of all the staff I have met. The founder is Anne Chege, who my brother and I know well. Anne worked with Barclays Bank for 28 years, looking after orphans and abandoned children within her own home. On retirement she opened this centre and has dedicated her life to the work.
