How are liminal spaces used in video games, and what makes them so terrifying? 
#gaming #gamespot #superliminal #liminalspace 

From the original DOOM to Gone Home; liminal spaces have crept their way into the experiences we love, a lot of the time without us noticing. In addition to examining big-name titles that happen to have liminal spaces in them, I played four games that use liminal spaces as their backdrop. Superliminal, Anemoiapolis, Escape the Backrooms, and Dream Logic. Let's explore what makes them so gosh darn scary.
