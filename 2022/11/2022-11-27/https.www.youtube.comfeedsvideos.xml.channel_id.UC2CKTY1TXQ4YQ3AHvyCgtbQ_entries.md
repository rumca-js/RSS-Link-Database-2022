We just had Thanksgiving here in the United States, and I'm going to talk about what I'm thankful for in wargaming! And of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
