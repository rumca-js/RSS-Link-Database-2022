After a long time away from Minnesota, Emily Haines and Jimmy Shaw of Metric return to The Current studio for a session hosted by Jill Riley. “At every stage, and in so many different settings, and like, externally, the state of the world, I feel like I've come into this room,” Haines says about The Current studio. “It's like a little time capsule.”

While talking with Jill Riley, Haines and Shaw describe the genesis of their latest album, "Formentera," and how the idea emerged from a book about global destinations. Their collective dream — during the height of pandemic lockdowns — centered on going to the Spanish island of Formentera, and this provided a cohesive vision.

Metric perform acoustic versions of songs from "Formentera" and 2018’s "Art of Doubt," and they finish with a song from their 2009 album, "Fantasies."  Watch and listen to the full session above.
