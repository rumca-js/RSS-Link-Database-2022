The G Cloud is a handheld gaming device from Logitech that's specifically designed for game streaming...other than that it's just an android tablet with a built in controller. I originally thought there was no way this thing could compete with the Steam Deck or other handhelds from Aya or OneXPlayer, but now that I've used it....I think maybe it could :|

PTM7950 looks like any other thermal paste that you might find pre-applied to a heatsink or squeeze out of a tube… only it’s not, because once this material gets above 45 degrees, it starts to MELT! But what does that actually mean the components you would use it on?
