This includes loadouts, various points of interest, and 3rd person mode.\u00a0\n\nThere was also a lot of looting and inventory management shown off. Content creator Repullze took to Twitter to clarify some confusion about the new system and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything away, they technically just added. You have an \u2018on person\u2019 inventory that\u2019s your standard WZ1 system and then there\u2019s your backpack that adds slots. Everything in your on person inventory auto picks up.\u201d\n\nRepullze continued by saying when you loot someone, the backpack auto fills things you need with the examples being armor plates or ammo stacking on top of what you already have in those slots.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeems simple enough, but the system\u2019s reveal has drawn plenty of criticism and so has DMZ as a whole. DMZ is an open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where players fight alone or together with the aim of getting to the chopper to escape. On their way, players will take part in \"faction-based\" missions and side objectives, as they fight against other human and AI players before exfiltration at the end of the round.\n\nIce Man Isaac reacted to the mode and said \u201cI think DMZ should be delayed. Let Warzone 2.0 go crazy on Nov 16th and keep working on DMZ until it's ready.\u201d TimTheTatMan had a similar reaction and said, \u201cdmz looked kinda meh. warzone 2 looked solid and I\u2019m excited for next week. 3rd person warzone 2 tho looked litttttt\u201d.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tex648vF3vw", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "God Of War Ragnarok\u2019s Immersive Mode Is The Way To Play", "description": "God of War Ragnarok is stunning, and if you want to truly appreciate all the detailed environments, enemies, and characters, this just might be the best way to experience Kratos\u2019 latest adventure.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #gamespot #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJ7dbua12Q", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - World Intro Official 4K Trailer", "description": "Following the fate of the guardsmen from the first teaser two years ago, check out this new world intro trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide! \n\n#DARKTIDE #Warhammer #Warhammer40k", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-DtwQUCWx4", "date_published": "2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Atomic Heart Official Boss Fight Gameplay", "description": "Check out 10 minutes of an intense boss fight you'll encounter in Atomic Heart. \n\nAtomic Heart releases on February 21, 2023 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pGIEKqQmXs", "date_published": "2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS Plus November Game Catalog Revealed | GameSpot News", "description": "Skyrim, Kingdom Hearts and more join PlayStation\u2019s Game Catalog.
