<p>Lewis Moody says men like him who have problems controlling their bladder or bowel face indignity in public bathrooms</p><p>The World Cup-winning England rugby player Lewis Moody has issued a taboo-breaking demand for sanitary disposal bins to become compulsory in male public bathrooms to cater for men with incontinence.</p><p>Moody, 44, is one of about <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-mds/haps/projects/HCNA/02HCNA3D3.pdf">10% of men</a> who have had problems controlling their bladder or bowel, many of whom regularly wear absorbent pads. But unlike women who can normally access special bins for period and incontinence pads, men often have nowhere to dispose of them, worsening an already undignified and uncomfortable experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/09/england-rugby-star-calls-for-incontinence-pad-bins-in-mens-loos">Continue reading...</a>

The Senate is too close to call, with the race in Nevada coming down to the wire and Georgia likely to go to a runoff in December.</p><p><strong>Who will win control of Congress?</strong> With many races still too close to call, control of Congress – and the future of Biden’s agenda – still hangs in the balance. Outcomes of some closely contested elections are not expected for several days, or even weeks.
