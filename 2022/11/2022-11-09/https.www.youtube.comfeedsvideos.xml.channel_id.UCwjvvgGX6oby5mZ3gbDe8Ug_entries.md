So what happened to those Foxconn employees after they reached home?
No matter what the government announcement is, whether it’s to lock down a place or lift it, the public is outraged. Underneath the city hall’s live stream, curses poured in. Citizens wrote angrily, "Liar!  Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!" "College students want to go home, go home, go home!" " I haven't washed for a month, and I can't go downstairs either. This is not the way to go, staying inside the dorm every day. It's very painful." "Please tell the truth." "Resign liars" "Livestream your lies, liar" "You deceive the higher ups and we die because of it." " Liars go to hell." Shortly after, the live comment feature was turned off.
