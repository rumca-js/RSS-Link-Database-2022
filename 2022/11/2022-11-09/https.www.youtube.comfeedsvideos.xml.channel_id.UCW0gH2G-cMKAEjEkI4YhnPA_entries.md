Today, we chat with Brian Sibley, the editor of the new Tolkien book "The Fall of Númenor", which assembles for the first time all of J.R.R. Tolkien's writings on the Second Age.  Brian has taken all of these Tolkien writings and placed them in chronological order according to Tolkien's own Tale of Years in The Lord of the Rings appendices.
