With the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, we decided to go back and chart the history of the mainline Pok\u00e9mon games. \n\nIn this video, we chart the history of the mainline Pok\u00e9mon games, starting back in the 90s to explore where its creator Satoshi Tajiri got the idea for pocket monsters, to the small team that brought them to life on the GameBoy. The games exploded in popularity because trade between the two versions was required to catch 'em all, and after the trading card game and TV show, Pok\u00e9mon became the juggernaut we know today. \n\nWith multiple mainline entries, from 2D to 3D titles, spin-offs, mobile games like Pok\u00e9mon Go, and now the latest game, Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, these cute monsters show no sign of slowing down. \n\nFor more Pok\u00e9mon, make sure to check out our list of ten things you never knew about the franchise, as well as our upcoming review and features around Arceus.

In this video specifically we will be using Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode and comparing the PlayStation 5 and base PlayStation 4. \n\nTimestamps 0:00\nIntroduction 0:36 \nLoading Times Comparison 1:23 \nUncharted 4 Comparison 3:47 \nUncharted The Lost Legacy Comparison \n#uncharted", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlEtqTwDzHA", "date_published": "2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection Review", "description": "Naughty Dog is one of the most recognizable names on PlayStation hardware, and the roaring success of its Uncharted franchise across two generations of the console plays a large part in that legacy. It makes sense then that the studio's first full release for the PlayStation 5 celebrates that storied history, bringing two of the series' best entries to new hardware with a suite of improvements that make experiencing the treasure-hunting adventures a pleasure again. Although some of the underlying design choices are showing some age, the Legacy of Thieves Collection is the best way to play Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: Lost Legacy.\n\u00a0\nAcross both games, the most significant changes are clear to see in the game's three modes of play. Fidelity mode targets a native 4K presentation, with the frame rate aiming for a locked 30fps(and sticking there for pretty much every scene). The new performance mode, which is likely the best way to play, reduces the resolution to 1440p but doubles the frame rate to 60fps, which it easily maintains for much more responsive gameplay. A third mode, Performance+, cuts the resolution even more, with a native 1080p presentation and a frame rate that aims for 120fps. You'll need a display that supports that in the first place, and even then, it's a tough concession to make visually for added fluidity that's not really required for the narrative-focused adventures that this collection contains.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat the additional horsepower of the PS5 offers, then, is choice, which wasn't present with the original releases on both the PS4 and PS4 Pro. Both Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy have been playable on PS5 through backwards-compatibility, but have been frustratingly locked to the same 30fps cap as the PS4 versions in both respective campaigns. The higher frame rates for both were reserved for their respective multiplayer modes, which aren't included in this Legacy of Thieves Collection anyway.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n#Uncharted", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9wRaZCo_1I", "date_published": "2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
