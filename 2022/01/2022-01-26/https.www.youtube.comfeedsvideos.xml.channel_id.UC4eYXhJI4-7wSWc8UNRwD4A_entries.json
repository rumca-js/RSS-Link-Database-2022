Cheerfully moving from ethno-techno to hip-hop, the group's buzzing synthesizers, rap declarations, and a Soviet-made accordion makes audiences come alive.\n\nSuistamon S\u00e4hk\u00f6's third album, 2021's Varokaa! Hengenvaara (loosely translated: \"Beware! Danger to Life\"), is both their most accessible and wildest material to date. It's music engineered (along with their sartorial fabulousness and irresistible dancing) to keep you warm on a frozen Scandinavian winter night. --The globalFEST staff\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kalman laulu\"\n\"Kotiin\"\n\"Hummani hei\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nEero Grundstr\u00f6m: electronics, vocals\nReetta-Kaisa Iles: vocals\nTuomas Juntunen: vocals\nAnne-Mari Kivim\u00e4ki: Notka accordion, 5-row accordion, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProduction: Silja Palom\u00e4ki, Folk Extreme\nAudio: Taito Hoffr\u00e9n, Antti Puumalainen\nVideo: Kim Saarinen, Modomo Films\nSpecial Thanks to Jenni Pietarila and Kalevan Kello\n\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTiny Desk Team\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nglobalFEST Artistic Team\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nglobalFEST Production Team\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film*\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSpecial Thanks\nThe Andrew W.
