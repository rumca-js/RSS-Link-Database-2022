These two Americans are aided in their journey by a Polish Gentile, who has restored Bransk\u2019s Jewish cemetery and researched the lives of the Jews who once lived there. The film captures these pilgrims as they face old neighbors, some who were betrayers, others who were saviors to the Jews of Bransk.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
