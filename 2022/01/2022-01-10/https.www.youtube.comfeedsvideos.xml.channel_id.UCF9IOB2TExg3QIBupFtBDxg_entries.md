United States, report record cases and people in hospital, for all of the pandemic so far

Monday, Reuters, 1.35 million new coronavirus infections

(Previous record was 1.03 million cases on Jan. 3.) 

Past week, 700,000 per day

Hospitalized

Also hit an all-time high

Doubled in past three weeks
Monday, 

136,604 people hospitalized with COVID-19

Previous record, 132,051, January 2021

Ongoing staff out sick

Many elective procedures suspended

Schools

Staff, teachers, bus drivers

Chicago classes cancelled 

New York City, three subway lines out

Deaths 1,700 per day

Pfizer, omicron vaccine in March

Next 6 to 8 weeks

More than half of people in Europe could be infected

Hans Kluge, director for Europe

a new west-to-east tidal wave sweeping across the region

The region saw over seven million cases of Covid-19 in the first week of 2022,

more than doubling over a two-week period

26 countries, more than 1 % being infected per week
Boosters, play an essential role in protecting the most vulnerable people from severe disease

Also for health workers, teachers

Lower vaccination rates

Balkans and Eastern Europe

For countries not yet hit with the omicron surge, there is a closing window to act now and plan for contingencies

France, Prime Minister Jean Castex

If we were to shut down classes as soon as there is one first case, 

bearing in mind the explosion of Omicron, 

all French schools would be closed in a matter of days

Catherine Smallwood, W.H.O. senior emergencies officer

Some sense of predictability needed to move from pandemic to endemic

We are still ways off

We still have a huge amount of uncertainty

Is deltacron a new mutation with the transmissibility of omicron and the pathogenesis of delta?

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/09/lab-contamination-sparks-false-fears-new-deltacron-covid-variant/

Cyprus

Not a new form of coronavirus

Recombination event

Lab contamination

Prof Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences,University of Cyprus, Head of the Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Virology

Suggested delta and omicron variants had amalgamated

There are currently omicron and delta co-infections and we found this strain that is a combination of these two

25 sequences were subsequently submitted to GISAID

https://www.gisaid.org

Dr Thomas Peacock, Imperial College London, Department of Infectious Disease

November, very small cluster,

really awful spike mutation profile

B.1.1.529, later omicron

Deltacron genetic profile

Looks  to be quite clearly contamination

Several colleagues

almost definitely contamination

doesn’t look like a real recombinant

Dr Simon Clarke, University of Reading

It’s perfectly possible for different versions of the virus that causes Covid-19 to combine sections of their genetic material, 

creating a recombinant, 

which is a genetic mosaic of the different variants

with altered characteristics, 

but they contain a number of telltale signs 
and ‘deltacron’ just doesn’t have any

Instead, its proposed genetic code looks more like what would happen if you contaminated one sample with another

That could have happened at any point between sampling and sequencing in the laboratory

and I strongly suspect this is what has happened. 

New variants will continue to come along, but I don’t think this is one.

UKHSA no new variants under surveillance

Prof Leondios Kostrikis

indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event

Deltacron infection is higher among patients hospitalised for Covid-19 than among non-hospitalised patients, 

so that rules out the contamination hypothesis


the samples were processed in multiple sequencing procedures in more than one country. 

And at least one sequence from Israel deposited in a global database exhibits genetic characteristics of Deltacron

Professor Nick Loman, microbial genomics professor University of Birmingham (UK)

While a recombinant form of Delta and Omicron would not be a complete surprise,

the finding from Cyprus is more likely a “technical artefact” that arose in the process of sequencing the viral genome
