contamination\n\ndoesn\u2019t look like a real recombinant\n\nDr Simon Clarke, University of Reading\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly possible for different versions of the virus that causes Covid-19 to combine sections of their genetic material, \n\ncreating a recombinant, \n\nwhich is a genetic mosaic of the different variants\n\nwith altered characteristics, \n\nbut they contain a number of telltale signs \nand \u2018deltacron\u2019 just doesn\u2019t have any\n\nInstead, its proposed genetic code looks more like what would happen if you contaminated one sample with another\n\nThat could have happened at any point between sampling and sequencing in the laboratory\n\nand I strongly suspect this is what has happened. \n\nNew variants will continue to come along, but I don\u2019t think this is one.\n\nDeltacron\u2019s genetic code\n\nScars of a notoriously faulty primer\n\nV3 72 amplicon\n\nAs of Monday

evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event\n\nDeltacron infection is higher among patients hospitalised for Covid-19 than among non-hospitalised patients, \n\nso that rules out the contamination hypothesis\n\n\nthe samples were processed in multiple sequencing procedures in more than one country. \n\nAnd at least one sequence from Israel deposited in a global database exhibits genetic characteristics of Deltacron\n\nProfessor Nick Loman, microbial genomics professor University of Birmingham (UK)\n\nWhile a recombinant form of Delta and Omicron would not be a complete surprise,\n\nthe finding from Cyprus is more likely a \u201ctechnical artefact\u201d that arose in the process of sequencing the viral
