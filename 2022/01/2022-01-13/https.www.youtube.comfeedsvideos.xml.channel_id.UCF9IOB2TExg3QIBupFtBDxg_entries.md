Cases are now still high but on the way down. I expect the US to follow this trend in about 2 to 3 weeks.

China

Zero covid policy

Quebec stops PCR tests for general public

Omicron, up to 60,000 tests per day

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pcr-tests-stopped-omicron-quebec-1.6304313

(Ontario already limiting)

PCR tests reserved,

high risk settings, hospitals, long-term care homes, prisons, homeless shelters, remote communities

Dr. Marie-France Raynault, Quebec public health

We are absolutely overwhelmed by the Omicron wave

Advice

Use rapid tests (if available)

Isolate if symptomatic

After 2 vaccine doses, isolate for 5 days

Sickness 

HCWs, 11,712 on Monday

Montreal police, 550 to 650, New Year's Day 

British Colombia

Zuher

British Columbia, reserved for First Responders, critical care

Public, just isolate, no LFTs either

British Columbia we are asked NOT to get tested if we have symptoms and we have been vaccinated.

Isolate and return to normal work if asymptomatic after 5 days


US

The ZOE data suggests the Omicron wave has peaked, and cases are starting to come down in almost all regions of the UK.

Hospitalisation, deaths and early data on the severity of Omicron is also looking positive. 

The other reassuring sign is that cases in the elderly are plateauing at a low level, sparing this more vulnerable group from the worst of the Omicron wave. 

This is likely because this group has been more careful and others are being careful around them. 

However, we can’t rule out an uptick in children, which could then have a knock on effect on the other age groups. 

In terms of guidance, working from home remains an easy thing many of us can do to slow spread, and wearing high quality masks on public transport to me still feels sensible. 

Covid symptoms are now for the first time this winter more common than colds and flu and are indistinguishable. 

I don’t expect these rates to go down to zero as Omicron is so infectious that it will probably continue to circulate at manageable levels in the population until late spring

Elias Balderas 

Got Alpha in April. Was Ill for 2 weeks. 

Just got omicron last week. Was very mild for me this time around. First 24 hours felt like a cold. 

Had the chills over night with slight cough. 72 hours later all is pretty much normal now. 

Not vaccinated BTW. I believe prior infection probably made it more mild for me this time.

## US hospital concerns

US hospitals are under great pressure, there are essentially three reasons for this.

Ontario, Canada, largest province in Canada, population of 15 million.
 
Several weeks ago we were told to STOP going for testing unless we were in a high risk category, 

so the number of cases is dramatically under-reported, 
 
https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/this-is-who-can-and-can-t-get-a-covid-19-test-in-ontario-1.5723794
 
So when you see cases dropping in Canada and the R value decreasing, its completely inaccurate, Ontario represents almost half of the popular of the entire country.

With or for covid

Jeremy Faust, emergency physician Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts

The truth is, we’re still in the emergency phase of the pandemic,

and everyone who is downplaying that should probably take a tour of a hospital before they do

Sara Murray, hospitalist at UC San Francisco

If a virus that causes less severe lung disease affects an extraordinarily large proportion of the population,
 you’ll still get a lot of them in the hospital with severe lung disease

Factors

Low vaccination uptake

Comorbidities

Residual circulation of delta

Post delta infection

Omicron areas, lower hospital admissions

Dr. Walensky

I suspect the deaths we are seeing now are still from Delta

James Lawler, infectious-disease physician, University of Nebraska Medical Center

the vast majority of our COVID-positive cases are at the hospital for reasons related to their COVID infection

Two neat categories, with and for

Vineet Arora, a hospitalist at the University of Chicago Medicine

If you’re on the margin of coming into the hospital, COVID tips you over

COVID might not be listed as a reason for admission, but no COVID, no admission

These incidental infections are not so incidental for people with chronic conditions

We have a lot of chronically ill people in the U.S., and it’s like all of those people are now coming into the hospital at the same time

So, its 3 categories

For covid

With covid that exacerbated a chronic condition

Truly incidentals

Craig Spencer, emergency physician, Columbia University Medical Center

The health-care system is in crisis and on the verge of collapse

It doesn’t matter whether it’s with or for. It’s a pure deluge of numbers

Mr Donald J. Trump

Boosters, politicians who refused to say whether they had received one were “gutless”

The fact is that I think the vaccines saved tens of millions throughout the world

Dysphunc 
 
I've had Covid-19 for 3 days now - 2nd vaccination dose 1 month ago. 

It just feels like a bad case of Pharyngitis. 

Congested sinus, gunky sore throat and bronchial tract inflamed. 

Occasional painful aspiration but nothing like when I had double Pneumonia. 

Oximeter reporting 95-98% the whole time so far which is reassuring.
