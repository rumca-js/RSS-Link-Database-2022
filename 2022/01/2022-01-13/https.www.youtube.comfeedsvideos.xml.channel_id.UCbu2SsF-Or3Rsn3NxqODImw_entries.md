In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the possibility of GTA 6 in 2023, the Hitman Trilogy coming to Game Pass, and more.

Video Notes: According to one analyst's prediction, the next entry in Rockstar's popular series might be in the works for 2023 or 2024. Other reports have suggested GTA 6 might not release until 2025.

The Hitman Trilogy, which includes three games in the World of Assassination series, will come to Xbox Game Pass on January 20, IO Interactive announced today as part of the company's Year 2 reveal. There are also a number of updates coming to Hitman 3 in its second year including technical improvements, VR for PC, and a new mode.

Lastly, Persia talks about Microsoft discontinuing production on the Xbox One S and Xbox One X just before the launch of the Xbox Series X|S consoles, allowing for retailers to finish selling any remaining stock of the last-gen devices.

If you’ve played, read or watched The Witcher, you’ll know that Geralt of Rivia carries 2 swords. A steel sword for non-magic folk, and a silver sword for supernatural creatures and things that go bump in the night. But why a silver sword? What is it about silver that has given it this mysterious supernatural power? And does that myth have any basis in fact?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries Museum in the UK to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson, and Historical Interpreter Keith Ducklin about the myths and the realities behind the silver sword.
