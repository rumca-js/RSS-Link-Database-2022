Got the infection last Tuesday. \n\nTested on Wednesday and was positive. It is what you described but the sore throat is terrible, you don\u2019t realise how often you swallow until it\u2019s torture to do so, \n\nbeen taking my D3 and zinc\n\nand if nothing else my new Granddaughter will get to know her Granddad \n\nMis en place \nWhen I woke up & feeling like I had a hangover, I immediately took my temperature, sure enough 38.7\u00b0c. \n\nKnew I had it, just needed confirmation. Performed a lateral flow test & bang! had a positive result in under 5 minutes. \n\nNo really outstanding symptoms. No sore throat, no real headache (just the tightness of the head - hangover), temperature fluctuated hour to hour, \n\ntaste bud's altered - no loss, just altered. Basically a general feeling of being unwell. \n\nThis lasted about 30 hrs & has improved greatly over a relatively short period. \n\nIt's now day 4 & feeling pretty good. Taste is still altered & a little phlegm but otherwise doing well & just waiting out the isolation protocol.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3W84wb5jKo", "date_published": "2022-01-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
