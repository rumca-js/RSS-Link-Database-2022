Has the risk benefit analysis changed now omicron is the variant?

The NHS is offering COVID-19 vaccine to children and young people aged 12 to 17 years

Two doses of vaccine 12 weeks apart

(or 12 weeks after a positive test)

UK boosters for 16 and 17 year olds in England

https://www.england.nhs.uk/2022/01/hundreds-of-thousands-of-teens-to-get-boosted-on-nhs-2/

Starting today

600,000 people aged 16 and 17 have had two doses

889,700 in England have had at least one dose

In line with JCVI guidance

NHS cannot vaccinate 16 and 17-year-olds within 12 weeks (84 days) of a positive COVID-19 test

Reduce further the "very, very small risk" of myocarditis in under-18s

UK, giving Pfizer rather than moderna

Can the Covid-19 vaccine cause myocarditis?

In most cases of myocarditis, heart function returns to normal. 

Cases, while still very rare, are slightly less rare in children and young people. 

It's still the case that millions of children around the world have had a Covid vaccine, virtually all of them without long term side effects. 

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not been linked to an increased risk of myocarditis. 

Getting Covid-19 can itself lead to myocarditis, as well as other forms of severe illness. 

Who is at risk from myocarditis following the vaccine?

Mostly affected young men aged 12 to 29

Usually after their second dose

Israel study, up to 4 in 100,000 men

Women was fewer than one in 100,000

Are children and young people at higher risk of heart inflammation from the vaccine?

Cases of heart inflammation after the vaccine, 

while still very rare, are slightly less rare in children and younger adults (up to the age of 39) 

UK up to 15 December 2021, 12 to 17 year olds

39 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis

(18 cases per million doses of vaccine)

18-29 year olds

29 per million doses

30-39 year-olds

22 per million doses

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and 4 CMOs confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective for children aged 12 to 15, 

as well as vulnerable children from the age of five. 

Is there a risk of cardiac arrest from the Covid vaccine?

No. There is no evidence that people are at risk of cardiac arrest in the days or weeks following the vaccine.

Denmark has changed their national guidelines https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/... Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.

Evidence from Dr. Peter Gaillard (microparticulate pharmacologist) https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/astraz... 

Denmark v Norway

Myocarditis 3 times more prevalent in Norway
Found there were no deaths or diagnoses of heart failure in people who were diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis after being vaccinated. 

In the UK, no figures have been published for cardiac arrests in under-18s following the vaccine, 

which means there have been a tiny number too small to be published, or none at all.
Catching Covid-19, on the other hand, can significantly increase your risk of cardiac arrest and death. 

Is there any link between the Covid-19 vaccine and cardiac arrests at football matches?

No, there isn’t.


Feeling like you need to be sick
 
I’ve heard about people getting myocarditis after the vaccine and I’m worried. Should I have my second dose/ booster dose? 

Yes. It’s recommended that you have your second dose or booster dose, if you are eligible. 
 
I was diagnosed with myocarditis after having the vaccine. Should I go ahead and book my second dose/ booster dose?

No, you should get advice from your health professional

## Specialists now agree on endemic ending

Boosters, can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly
We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting
With omicron there will be a lot of natural immunity taking place on top of vaccination,

We will be fastly moving to a scenario which is close to endemicity

Fourth dose for all

Data has not yet been generated to support this approach

Repeated vaccinations in a short time frame will not represent a sustainable long term strategy

Endemic Covid, very soon

Omicron, endemic

Consistent and predictable, not boom and bust

Common colds, influenza, HIV, measles, malaria, tuberculosis

A new Covid-era

Prof Julian Hiscox, Chair in Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool

UK, New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group

We're almost there, it is now the beginning of the end, at least in the UK

I think life in 2022 will be almost back to before the pandemic

Should a new variant or old variant come along, for most of us, like any other common cold coronavirus, we'll get the sniffles and a bit of a headache and then we're OK

If you're willing to tolerate zero deaths from Covid, then we're facing a whole raft of restrictions and it's not game over

in a bad flu season, 200-300 die a day over winter and nobody wears a mask or socially distances,

that's perhaps a right line to draw in the sand

Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, virologist, St George's, University of London

I am very optimistic

We'll soon be in a situation where the virus is circulating, we will take care of people at risk, but for anybody else we accept they will catch it – 

and your average person will be fine

We need to accept the fact that our flu season is also going to be a coronavirus season, and that is going to be a challenge for us

However, it is still uncertain how bad winters will be as the people who die from flu and Covid tend to be the same

(You can't die twice)

Prof Azra Ghani, epidemiologist, Imperial College London

Covid will still be around, but that we no longer need to restrict our lives

It seems like it's taken a long time, but only a year ago we started vaccinating and we're already an awful lot freer because of that

A new variant that can outcompete Omicron and be more pathogenic

Prof Eleanor Riley, immunologist, University of Edinburgh

When Omicron has finished and moved through, immunity in the UK will be high, at least for a while

Hi John, I’m going through a period of suffering. Got the infection last Tuesday. 

Tested on Wednesday and was positive. It is what you described but the sore throat is terrible, you don’t realise how often you swallow until it’s torture to do so, 

been taking my D3 and zinc

and if nothing else my new Granddaughter will get to know her Granddad 

Mis en place 
When I woke up & feeling like I had a hangover, I immediately took my temperature, sure enough 38.7°c. 

Knew I had it, just needed confirmation. Performed a lateral flow test & bang! had a positive result in under 5 minutes. 

No really outstanding symptoms. No sore throat, no real headache (just the tightness of the head - hangover), temperature fluctuated hour to hour, 

taste bud's altered - no loss, just altered. Basically a general feeling of being unwell. 

This lasted about 30 hrs & has improved greatly over a relatively short period. 

It's now day 4 & feeling pretty good. Taste is still altered & a little phlegm but otherwise doing well & just waiting out the isolation protocol.
