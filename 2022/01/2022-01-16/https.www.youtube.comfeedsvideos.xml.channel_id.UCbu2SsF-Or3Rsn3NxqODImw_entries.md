For over 20 years, we’ve been tactically sneaking and breaching our way through numerous Rainbow Six games such as Rainbow Six Siege, Rogue Spear, and Rainbow Six Vegas. Now there’s a new take on the franchise: Rainbow Six Extraction, which takes elite operators and pits them against an alien threat. But how did we get here? Here’s the evolution of Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six.

The M1 Garand has made a huge impact in the real world, and in the world of our pop culture, movies and games, and is famous for making a ringing PING sound when fired until empty. But where does this sound come from, and how does it factor into the M1 Garand’s revolutionary design? 

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the mechanical and design idiosyncrasies of one of WW2’s most iconic weapons, the M1 Garand.
