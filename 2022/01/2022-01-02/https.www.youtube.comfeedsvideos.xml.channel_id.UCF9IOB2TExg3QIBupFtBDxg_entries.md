Record infections

Plans to reopen economy

Prime Minister Scott Morrison

We have to stop thinking about case numbers and think about serious illness,

living with the virus, 

managing our own health and ensuring that we're monitoring those symptoms 

and we keep our economy going

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/all-of-us-are-going-to-be-exposed-to-omicron-queensland-chief-health-officer-warns

Queensland, chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard

Omicron, peak at very large numbers in late January or early February

We are expecting in the next few weeks very substantial numbers of people are going to be infected 

I think we just have to assume that all of us are going to be exposed in the next few weeks

we can expect very large numbers of cases
and in the majority of cases, 

the vast majority of cases, 
the symptoms will be mild
 
So clearly the vaccine is working

Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk

What we’re doing is telling people to go and get vaccinated. 

We have … given every Queenslander in this state the opportunity to get vaccinated

I’m now urging people in those Indigenous communities to ignore those social media posts and immediately go and get your vaccination


SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant replication in human respiratory tract ex vivo 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1189219/v1

Omicron infects and multiplies 70 times faster than the Delta in human bronchus

Omicron variant replicated 10 times less in human lung tissue than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus 

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 Variant leads to less severe disease than Pango B and Delta variants strains in a mouse model of severe COVID-19

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.474085v2

Mice infected with Delta compared to mice infected with Omicron

Less severe clinical signs (weight loss)

Lower virus loads

Less extensive inflammation in the lungs

T cell epitopes probably conserved

Clinical consequences of infection with the 
Omicron variant may be less severe,

but the higher transmissibility could still place huge burden upon healthcare systems



The omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern does not readily infect Syrian hamsters

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.24.474086v1

All other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in Syrian hamsters

In hamsters that had been infected with omicron, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs

No infectious virus was detectable in the lungs

Histopathological examination, lungs from omicron-infected hamsters, no signs pneumonia. 










The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron virus causes attenuated infection and disease in mice and hamsters 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1211792/v1

B.1.1.529 Omicron isolates

Immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2) 

Expressing mice and hamsters

Attenuated lung disease

Not as ill

Lower viral loads



SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells

The hyper-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant exhibits significant antigenic change, vaccine escape and a switch in cell entry mechanism

Omicron, markedly decreased neutralisation in serology

In order

Three doses of vaccine

Immunity from natural infection (without vaccination)

Two doses of vaccine

Omicron, compared to Delta and Wuhan D614G

Titres of the Omicron variant in lung tissue,

were at least an order of magnitude lower at each time point compared to the other two variants

This is consistent with attenuated replication of Omicron in lower respiratory tissues as recently reported

## Omicron is displacing delta science

Omicron infection also produced immunity against Delta. This means someone who has been infected with delta is largely immune to subsequent delta infection. Therefore delta will soon have no one to infect, therefore will go away.

Omicron has been shown to be highly transmissible

Omicron has extensive evasion of neutralizing antibody immunity,

elicited by vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

Omicron infections are rapidly expanding worldwide often in the face of high levels of Delta infections. 

Question

Do omicron antibodies neutralise delta virus variant?

Does neutralizing immunity elicited by Omicron also enhances neutralizing immunity against the Delta variant?

Method

Isolated the omicron and delta virus

Tested these against the plasma of 15 confirmed omicron cases

Used a live virus neutralization assay
(Vero E6 cells were propagated in complete growth medium) 

Calculated the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) 

Volunteers

Previously vaccinated

Unvaccinated individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the Omicron infection wave

Recruited soon after symptom onset
 
We then measured their ability to neutralize both Omicron and Delta virus at enrolment,

versus a median of 14 days after enrolment. 

Neutralization of Omicron increased 14-fold over this time,
 
showing a developing antibody response to omicron

Also
Enhancement of Delta virus neutralization, increased 4.4-fold. 

Therefore

The increase in Delta variant neutralization in individuals infected with Omicron may result in decreased ability of Delta to re-infect

Also

Emerging data indicating that Omicron is less pathogenic than Delta

Therefore

Cross immunity from omicron to delta may have positive implications in terms of decreasing the Covid-burden of severe disease. 

More science
The ability of one variant to elicit immunity which can cross-neutralize another variant varies by variant

Immunity elicited by Delta infection

Does not cross-neutralize Beta virus

Immunity elicited by Beta infection

Does not cross-neutralize Delta well 

Participants in this study

Many probably previously infected

More than half were vaccinated

Therefore  activation of antibody immunity from previous infection and/or vaccination is possible

Implications

These results are consistent with Omicron displacing the Delta variant

As cross immunity makes re-infection with Delta less likely

(But previous delta exposure will not protect from symptomatic omicron infection)

If indeed Omicron is less pathogenic than Delta

The incidence of Covid-19 severe disease would be reduced

Infection may shift to become less disruptive to individuals and society
