Nobody wants to relive the time of almost complete Internet Explorer domination again. Unfortunately our choices are significantly fewer than they seem to be at first glance, as Chrome and Safari (thanks to the iPhone) totally dominate the browser landscape in terms of usage and almost all browsers these days are built on top of Chromium, Google\u2019s open-source browser project. Funny enough even Edge is built on top of Chromium today, despite the bitter rivalry between Google and Microsoft. What\u2019s also funny is that Chrome and Safari control about 85% of the browser market share today, and Microsoft\u2019s Edge commands only about 4%:", "link": "https://batsov.com/articles/2021/11/28/firefox-is-the-only-alternative/", "date_published": "2022-01-02 08:54:00.867609+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en"}]
