Was Ill for 2 weeks. \n\nJust got omicron last week. Was very mild for me this time around. First 24 hours felt like a cold. \n\nHad the chills over night with slight cough. 72 hours later all is pretty much normal now. \n\nNot vaccinated BTW. I believe prior infection probably made it more mild for me this time.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRycK82LsTE", "date_published": "2022-01-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
