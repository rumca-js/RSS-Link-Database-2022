Cases are now still high but on the way down. I expect the US to follow this trend in about 2 to 3 weeks.

We are absolutely overwhelmed by the Omicron wave

Advice

Use rapid tests (if available)

Isolate if symptomatic

After 2 vaccine doses, isolate for 5 days

British Columbia we are asked NOT to get tested if we have symptoms and we have been vaccinated.

Isolate and return to normal work if asymptomatic after 5 days

The ZOE data suggests the Omicron wave has peaked, and cases are starting to come down in almost all regions of the UK.

Hospitalisation, deaths and early data on the severity of Omicron is also looking positive. 

The other reassuring sign is that cases in the elderly are plateauing at a low level, sparing this more vulnerable group from the worst of the Omicron wave. 

This is likely because this group has been more careful and others are being careful around them. 

However, we can’t rule out an uptick in children, which could then have a knock on effect on the other age groups. 

In terms of guidance, working from home remains an easy thing many of us can do to slow spread, and wearing high quality masks on public transport to me still feels sensible. 

Covid symptoms are now for the first time this winter more common than colds and flu and are indistinguishable. 

I don’t expect these rates to go down to zero as Omicron is so infectious that it will probably continue to circulate at manageable levels in the population until late spring

Elias Balderas 

Got Alpha in April. Was Ill for 2 weeks. 

Just got omicron last week. Was very mild for me this time around. First 24 hours felt like a cold. 

Had the chills over night with slight cough. 72 hours later all is pretty much normal now. 

Not vaccinated BTW. I believe prior infection probably made it more mild for me this time.
