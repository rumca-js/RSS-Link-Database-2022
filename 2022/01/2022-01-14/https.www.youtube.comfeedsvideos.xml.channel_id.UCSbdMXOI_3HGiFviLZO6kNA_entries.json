Today I do some more in depth coverage of the HaritoraX, a full body tracking device that launched a while ago in Japan but is now coming to the Unites States and possibly other countries. I love full body tracking within VR and I think it adds SO much to the experience, but it's almost always been prohibitively expensive. This is the first chance for people that can't afford basestation to have good full body tracking without having any technical knowledge. Slime VR is also very good and quite similar, but as a package this hasn't been beat yet. This is not a full review yet- I will have a unit in hand to compare to other tracking methods soon. This are my impressions at the Shiftall booth at CES 2022. \n\nhttps://en.shiftall.net/products/haritorax\n\nMy links:\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\nTwitch.tv/Thrilluwu\nTwitter.com/Thrilluwu\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 INTRO\n01:23 HARITORAX\n03:04 IMPRESSIONS\n03:09 SETUP\n03:43 TRACKING\n04:15 EXPANSION SLOTS\n04:25 BATTERY LIFE\n04:35 OCCLUSION\n05:01 CONCLUSIONS\n07:03 OUTRO", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfCSKM0MyrQ", "date_published": "2022-01-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
