Resident Evil Code: Veronica is an overlooked gem of the series and we simply don't know why. Join Richie as he explains why you should play one of the series last classic-style titles.

Resident Evil Code: Veronica was the last of the fixed-camera classic titles with the emphasis on survival via strict item management and strategic save points. Years later, Resident Evil 4 began using the now popular third-person, over-the-shoulder style before eventually transitioning into a first-person series with Resident Evil VII and Village. 

Code Veronica is loved by many, so Richie Bracamonte is here to reflect on why Code Veronica is so special and how there possibly won't ever be another game like it.  Fortunately, if you're interested in checking out this classic, it's available on everything from the original Sega Dreamcast Version, all the way to the Xbox Series X and PS5.

A must have for any World War 2 video game, the M1 Garand is a huge part of military history, and the arsenal of pop culture weapons. It was a tool that helped the allies fight in the Second World War, and has since been seen in plenty of games, from Call of Duty and Battlefield through to Fallout: New Vegas. But what about the rest of the Garand's history, the myths behind it, and its impact it has had on gaming over 80 years after it's invention?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the history and impact of one of WW2’s most iconic weapons, the M1 Garand.
