We'll talk about his likely origin in the Misty Mountains, his time living alone near Mirkwood and helping Thorin's Company, and his legacy.  Not only would he have descendants of his own (including Grimbeorn), but there would be many men who would follow him as lord of the Beornings.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
