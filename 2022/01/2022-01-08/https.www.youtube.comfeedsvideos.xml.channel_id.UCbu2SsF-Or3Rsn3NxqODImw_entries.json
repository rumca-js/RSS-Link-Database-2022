Join Richie as he explains why you should play one of the series last classic-style titles.\n\nResident Evil Code: Veronica was the last of the fixed-camera classic titles with the emphasis on survival via strict item management and strategic save points.

Fortunately, if you're interested in checking out this classic, it's available on everything from the original Sega Dreamcast Version, all the way to the Xbox Series X and PS5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZhiQCO-_y4", "date_published": "2022-01-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "M1 Garand: A Gaming & Historical Legend - Loadout", "description": "A must have for any World War 2 video game, the M1 Garand is a huge part of military history, and the arsenal of pop culture weapons.
