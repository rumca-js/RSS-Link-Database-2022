The mighty skin-changer, a mountain of a man capable of transforming into a giant and fearsome bear - today we cover the life of Beorn!  We'll talk about his likely origin in the Misty Mountains, his time living alone near Mirkwood and helping Thorin's Company, and his legacy.  Not only would he have descendants of his own (including Grimbeorn), but there would be many men who would follow him as lord of the Beornings.
