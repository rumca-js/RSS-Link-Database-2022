You can also create diagrams and math formulas.\n\nJoplin supports notebooks, and tags to better organize all your notes, and you can sync everything between devices using Dropbox, OneDrive, or Joplin Cloud, although this last one is paid for.\n\nWriting your notes is done in the markdown editor, but you have buttons to handle formatting and adding media to your notes. The preview panel on the right is updated in real time.\n\nIf you want another open source, cross platform note taking app with sync capabilities, but without too many features, SimpleNote is for you.\n\nThey provide basically all packaging formats you'd need, and it's also on Flathub. It's another electron app, but syncing online is free, with support for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux. \n\nThe app itself just handles a list of notes, and for each note, it offers basic markdown syntax, with the ability to link notes to each other, decide if you want to sync them or not, version history, and tags.\n\nEvernote now has a native Linux client, in beta. It's free if you don't upload more than 60MB of data per month, and it becomes paid beyond that. It's also not open source.\n\nIt's still an interesting organization tool, especially for the paid-for plans, as you can connect it to your Google Calendar, if you use that, and basically have notes for each project, with associated meetings, tasks, files, and, well, notes.\n\nIf you need a native app, with a lot of power, QOwnNotes is open source, of course, it's designed to integrate with Nextcloud or OwnCloud.\n\nIt handles full markdown syntax, including code blocks, quotes, images, or links. Its note structure is basically the folder structure of your Nextcloud Notes, it doesn't do notebooks, although you can add tags.\n\nXournal has Linux, Windows, MacOS, and Android versions, and they all can open your Xournal notes.\n\nThe app is open source, and it's still one of the best out there if you take your notes by hand with a stylus. It can handle pressure sensitivity, and drawing tablets, it lets you choose paper backgrounds to imitate the support you're trying to emulate, it can annotate on top of PDFs, export to a ton of formats, including PDF and PNG, and has a whole lot of tools available.\n\nIf you want a more modern looking handwritten note tool, you can also check out RNote.\n\nIf you want a basic, native, open source app that looks good on GNOME or elementary OS, then you have Notejot. \n\nYou can create notebooks to categorize your notes, it supports search, and lets you define colors for each note. The experience is super simple: you get very basic formatting, with bold, italic, underlined or strikethrough, and unordered lists, and that's it.\n\nIf what you're looking for in your notes app is more along the lines of a wiki, where notes can be connected to each other and serve as a knowledge base, GNote might be better suited for you.\n\nIt lets you create notebooks to categorize things, and each note supports formatting, like bold, underlined, font sizes, bullet points, and more.\n\nIf you write the name of another note, a link will automatically be created to that note, and if you later change the name of a note, all links are automatically updated.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d7kosQ0Ji4", "date_published": "2022-01-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
