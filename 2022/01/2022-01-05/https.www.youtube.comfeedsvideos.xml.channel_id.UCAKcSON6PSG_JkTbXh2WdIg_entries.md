Mary Lucia talks about 'The Super Bob Einstein Movie,' which debuted on HBO on December 28, 2021. The film celebrates the life and legacy of the late actor, writer and producer Bob Einstein, known for his Super Dave Osborne character as well as for his Marty Funkhouser character on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

"All of the people recalling his comedic style just point out that it was unbreakable," Mary says. "He was so funny by not trying to be funny."
