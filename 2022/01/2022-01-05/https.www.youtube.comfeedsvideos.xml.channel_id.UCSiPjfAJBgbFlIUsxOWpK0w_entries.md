All of our Daft Punk covers are now on one Daft Pomp album. Also there is vinyl. Itâ€™s very exciting. Get your limited edition ðŸ˜Ž vinyl at http://pomplamoose.com

 Now that Daft Punk has left us forever, it is our duty to cover their songs. Ok yeah, we were already doing that. But itâ€™s even MORE IMPORTANT now.
