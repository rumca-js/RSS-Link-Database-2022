In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Sony buying Bungie for $3.6 Billion, four new titles coming to PS Now in February, and more. 

Sony is buying Bungie in a deal valued at $3.6 billion, it was announced today which will make Bungie become an "independent subsidiary" of Sony Interactive Entertainment. And if that has you wondering what the state of Destiny and other Bungie titles will be in terms of future releases, Bungie will continue to release multiplatform games going forward, and the company will have the option to "self-publish and reach players wherever they choose to play," 

Sony has also announced February's additions to the PlayStation Now catalog, and there are four games headed to the streaming service this week including, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, Little Big Workshop, Through the Darkest Times, and Death Squared.

Later in the video, Persia also talks about the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII and the possibility of more details on the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake being revealed this year.
