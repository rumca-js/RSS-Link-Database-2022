Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nFelix Contreras | January 12, 2022\nIt\u2019s fair to say Mon Laferte is a musical chameleon. The Chilean vocalist\u2019s output of late has covered a vast swath of musical styles from Latin America, from big-band mambo to electronic dance club jams with a hint of reggaeton, and a few stops in between. The secret to the successes of these stylistic changes is the level of imagination and creativity she infuses in each turn.\n\nSo, it didn\u2019t surprise me that her contribution to our Tiny Desk (home) concert series is a visual treat as much as it is a musical one. The opening strains of \u201cTu Falta de Querer\u201d introduce a cabaret-styled small orchestra and a character who appears to be left at the altar of a small intimate colonial church. She\u2019s in torch-singer mode throughout the four-song performance; take these lyrics from the first cut: \u201cAhora domir\u00e9 /  Muy profundamente para olvidar / Quisiera hasta la muerte, para no pensar / Me forro pa\u2019 quitarme esta amarguara\u201d (\u201cNow I'll sleep very deeply to forget I would like, until death, not to think. I erase you to take away this bitterness\u201d)\n\nThe 10-piece small orchestra is a combination of Mexican folkloric music and European chamber music, mixing the ukulele-like jarana, an oboe, a tuba, and the violins often used in mariachi. The arrangements are the perfect vehicle for Laferte\u2019s impassioned combination of blues and ranchera vocals.\n\nThere is much to appreciate in Laferte\u2019s celebration of the spiritual (the church setting) and the passions of everyday life (her torch singing). In fact, I can\u2019t think of many other vocalists who would be able to pull this off with as much grace, style and artistic vision as Mon Laferte does.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Tu Falta de Querer\"\n\"Por Qu\u00e9 Me Fui A Enamorar de Ti\"\n\"Se Me Va A Quemar El Coraz\u00f3n\"\n\"Placer Hollywood\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMon Laferte: vocals\nSebasti\u00e1n Aracena: guitar, docerola\nTonatiuh Mej\u00eda: piano\nDiana Gaby: tuba\nObed Calixto: guitar, docerola, jarana\nSantiago Ortiz: percussion\nAlonso S\u00e1nchez: flute\nIsmael Fernandez: clarinet\nArielle Amezcua: oboe\nBraulio Hernandez: bassoon\nObed Vazques: horns, spoons\nAlex Soto: vocals Auro: vocals\nCancamusa: vocals\nCarmen Ru\u00edz: vocals\nDaniel Qui\u00e9n: vocals\nEle Huex: vocals\nEli Moya: vocals\nGrtsch: vocals\nIrina \u00cdndigo: vocals\nLa Morra De La Vihuela: vocals\nLorena Guti\u00e9rrez: vocals\nMati Santos: vocals\nMaxulyses: vocals\nMica Schlieper: vocals\nRulo: vocals\nVivir Quintana: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nDirector and Editor: Camila Grandi\nProduction Manager: Fernanda Casillas\nProducer: Florencia Quinteros\nProduction Assistants: Pamela Diaz, Jimena Garate\nAssistant Director: David Casta\u00f1\u00f3n\nColor: Sergio Bejarez\nDirector of Photography: Sebasti\u00e1n Cantillo\nCamera 1 AC: Sof\u00eda Ramos\nCamera 2 AC: Javier Silvestre Gonz\u00e1lez\nCamera Op: Pablo Bernst\nPhotographer: Fija Mayra Ortiz\nGaffer: Gustavo Calder\u00f3n Rodriguez\nSteadicam: Enrique Moncada\nCamera Manager: Guillermo Vidal\nDigital Imaging Tech: Juan Jos\u00e9 Olivares\nArt Direction: Josechu Garrido\nSwings: Julio Santos, Eric Jasso\nMusical Production and Direction: Manu Jalil\nMixing Engineer: Abelardo Rivera\nMastering Engineer: Chalo Gonz\u00e1lez\nMusical Arrangement: Man\u00fa Jalil, Marco Uriel Jim\u00e9nez\nRecording Engineer: Man\u00fa Jalil, Juan Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n\nLocation: Bajo La Monta\u00f1a\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Andy Huether\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Josh Rogosin, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #monlaferte", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4pEFFbFsA", "date_published": "2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
