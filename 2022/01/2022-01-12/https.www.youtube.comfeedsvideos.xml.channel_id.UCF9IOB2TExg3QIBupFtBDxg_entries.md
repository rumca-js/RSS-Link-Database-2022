US hospitals are under great pressure, there are essentially three reasons for this.

Ontario, Canada, largest province in Canada, population of 15 million.
 
Several weeks ago we were told to STOP going for testing unless we were in a high risk category, 

so the number of cases is dramatically under-reported,

So when you see cases dropping in Canada and the R value decreasing, its completely inaccurate, Ontario represents almost half of the popular of the entire country.

With or for covid

Jeremy Faust, emergency physician Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts

The truth is, we’re still in the emergency phase of the pandemic,

and everyone who is downplaying that should probably take a tour of a hospital before they do

Sara Murray, hospitalist at UC San Francisco

If a virus that causes less severe lung disease affects an extraordinarily large proportion of the population,
 you’ll still get a lot of them in the hospital with severe lung disease

Factors

Low vaccination uptake

Comorbidities

Residual circulation of delta

Post delta infection

Omicron areas, lower hospital admissions

Dr. Walensky

I suspect the deaths we are seeing now are still from Delta

James Lawler, infectious-disease physician, University of Nebraska Medical Center

the vast majority of our COVID-positive cases are at the hospital for reasons related to their COVID infection

Two neat categories, with and for

Vineet Arora, a hospitalist at the University of Chicago Medicine

If you’re on the margin of coming into the hospital, COVID tips you over

COVID might not be listed as a reason for admission, but no COVID, no admission

These incidental infections are not so incidental for people with chronic conditions

We have a lot of chronically ill people in the U.S., and it’s like all of those people are now coming into the hospital at the same time

So, its 3 categories

For covid

With covid that exacerbated a chronic condition

Truly incidentals

Craig Spencer, emergency physician, Columbia University Medical Center

The health-care system is in crisis and on the verge of collapse

It doesn’t matter whether it’s with or for. It’s a pure deluge of numbers

Mr Donald J. Trump

Boosters, politicians who refused to say whether they had received one were “gutless”

The fact is that I think the vaccines saved tens of millions throughout the world

Dysphunc 
 
I've had Covid-19 for 3 days now - 2nd vaccination dose 1 month ago. 

It just feels like a bad case of Pharyngitis. 

Congested sinus, gunky sore throat and bronchial tract inflamed. 

Occasional painful aspiration but nothing like when I had double Pneumonia. 

Oximeter reporting 95-98% the whole time so far which is reassuring.

Omicron is less severe and natural immunity works

Clinical outcomes among patients infected with Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant in southern California

Background

The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly achieved global dissemination,

accounting for most infections in the United States by December 2021. 

November 30, 2021 to January 1, 2022, Delta v Omicron

Using S gene target failure (SGTF) (99.7%)

Hospital admission

Lengths of hospital stay

Hospital admissions associated with new-onset respiratory symptoms

Intensive care unit (ICU) admission

Mechanical ventilation

Mortality

Group 1, omicron

N =  52,297, cases with Omicron variant infections

Hospital admissions, 235 (0.5%)

Mean follow-up, 5.5 days

88 admitted

ITU, 7

Ventilated, 0

Deaths, 1

Length of hospital stay, 3.4 days (70%) less than delta

Group 2, non – omicron (delta)

N = 16,982, cases with Delta variant infections

Hospital admissions, 222 (1.3%)

Mean follow-up, 15.8 days

189 admitted

ITU, 23

Ventilated, 11

Deaths, 14

Also

Omicron variant infection, reduced risk of hospitalization across age and comorbidity categories 

Risk of symptomatic hospitalization was markedly reduced among cases who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection ≥90 days prior

Intrinsically less severe infection

Less severe in vaccinated and unvaccinated

Evidence for a reduction in severe outcomes among vaccinated cases with both Delta and Omicron variant infections in our study suggests substantial public health benefits from continued COVID-19 vaccination.

Cross-reactive memory T cells associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 contacts

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27674-x

Cross-reactive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2

52 COVID-19 household contacts

We enumerate the frequency of specific T cells 

Spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and ORF1,

that cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses

Nucleocapsid-specific T cells

Limited protective function of spike-cross-reactive T cells

Our results are thus consistent with,

pre-existing non-spike cross-reactive memory T cells,

protecting SARS-CoV-2-naïve contacts from infection, 

thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in second-generation vaccines.
