Meanwhile we have the PC version running on maxed out \u201cultra\u201d settings at a native 4K resolution.\n\nThe PC version does offer a small but decent number of improvements such as increased texture quality and dynamic fog. However, these can be pretty subtle. You will notice a major difference in shadows, which can change some scenes quite dramatically. Also, you will notice a difference in color, however that has more to do with how these games were captured on different devices and is not indicative of any real difference between the two versions.\n\nCheck out some Ultrawide gameplay here: https://youtu.be/5hkK2A8i6hM\n\n#GodofWar", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zZ0C91rsn4", "date_published": "2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite's Mangler Might Get Nerfed & Players Are Divided | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite\u2019s Mangler possibly getting nerfed, Horizon Forbidden West leaking early and Among Us becoming the PlayStation Store\u2019s most downloaded game in December 2021.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, Persia explains why players are divided over Halo Infinite's weapon, the Mangler, possibly getting nerfed.
