Is deltacron a new mutation with the transmissibility of omicron and the pathogenesis of delta?

Cyprus

Not a new form of coronavirus

Recombination event

Lab contamination

Prof Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences,University of Cyprus, Head of the Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Virology

Suggested delta and omicron variants had amalgamated

There are currently omicron and delta co-infections and we found this strain that is a combination of these two

25 sequences were subsequently submitted to GISAID

Dr Thomas Peacock, Imperial College London, Department of Infectious Disease

November, very small cluster,

really awful spike mutation profile

B.1.1.529, later omicron

Deltacron genetic profile

Looks  to be quite clearly contamination

Several colleagues

almost definitely contamination

doesn’t look like a real recombinant

Dr Simon Clarke, University of Reading

It’s perfectly possible for different versions of the virus that causes Covid-19 to combine sections of their genetic material, 

creating a recombinant, 

which is a genetic mosaic of the different variants

with altered characteristics, 

but they contain a number of telltale signs 
and ‘deltacron’ just doesn’t have any

Instead, its proposed genetic code looks more like what would happen if you contaminated one sample with another

That could have happened at any point between sampling and sequencing in the laboratory

and I strongly suspect this is what has happened. 

New variants will continue to come along, but I don’t think this is one.

indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event

Deltacron infection is higher among patients hospitalised for Covid-19 than among non-hospitalised patients, 

so that rules out the contamination hypothesis


the samples were processed in multiple sequencing procedures in more than one country. 

And at least one sequence from Israel deposited in a global database exhibits genetic characteristics of Deltacron

Professor Nick Loman, microbial genomics professor University of Birmingham (UK)

While a recombinant form of Delta and Omicron would not be a complete surprise,

the finding from Cyprus is more likely a “technical artefact” that arose in the process of sequencing the viral genome

Long COVID continues to affect more than a million people

1.3 million people (2%)

in the four weeks to 6 December 2021

LC for less than 12 weeks

21% (270,000 people)

LC for more than 12 weeks

70% (892,000 people)

LC for a year or more

40% (506,000 people)

20% reported their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been “limited a lot”

Symptoms

Fatigue, 51%

Loss of smell, 37%

Shortness of breath, 36%

Difficulty in concentrating, 28%

Self-reported long COVID was greatest in:

aged 35 to 69 years

females

people living in more deprived areas

those working in health care and social care

those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability

those in teaching and education

Brain disease

Statue-like condition, speechless, motionless

One million victims or more

Half a million deaths
Most survivors never returned to their pre-morbid vigour

Oliver Sacks

They would be conscious and aware – yet not fully awake; 

they would sit motionless and speechless all day in their chairs, totally lacking energy, impetus, initiative, motive, appetite, affect or desire; 

they registered what went on about them without active attention, and with profound indifference. 

They neither conveyed nor felt the feeling of life; they were as insubstantial as ghosts, and as passive as zombies

Group 1

Diabetes incidence among patients aged less than 18 years after covid diagnosis

Group 2

Diabetes incidence among those matched by age and sex, no covid diagnosis

Group 3

Received a pre pandemic non–COVID-19 acute respiratory infection diagnosis

Result

N = 80,893 patients with COVID-19 

New diabetes diagnosis 0.08%, 64 patients

New diabetes diagnosis was 31% more likely to occur

N = 439,439 patients with COVID-19

New diabetes diagnosis 0.25%, 1,233 patients

New diabetes diagnoses were 166% more likely to occur

New diabetes diagnosis in less than 18s

116% more likely to occur among those with COVID-19 than among those with ARI during the pre pandemic period

Non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection was not associated with diabetes. 

More severe covid may increase risk of DM
