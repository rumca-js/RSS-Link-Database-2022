We got early access to the game so we\u2019ve put together a side by side comparison. The PC version is running at 1440p on max settings, although I kept motion blur and depth of field off. Don\u2019t expect any drastic improvements when it comes to visuals, it really just looks like a sharper, cleaner version of what we have on Switch. Although one major annoyance is the prominent shadow dithering on the Switch version is still here on PC and its way more bothersome here. Maybe that can be fixed in the future. If you enjoy this video, why not give us a like and sub if you already haven\u2019t, and thanks for watching.\n\n#MonsterHunterRise", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q30_iQkAVIs", "date_published": "2022-01-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "It's Time You Played Resident Evil: Code Veronica", "description": "Resident Evil Code: Veronica is an overlooked gem of the series and we simply don't know why. Join Richie as he explains why you should play one of the series last classic-style titles.\n\nResident Evil Code: Veronica was the last of the fixed-camera classic titles with the emphasis on survival via strict item management and strategic save points. Years later, Resident Evil 4 began using the now popular third-person, over-the-shoulder style before eventually transitioning into a first-person series with Resident Evil VII and Village. \n\nCode Veronica is loved by many, so Richie Bracamonte is here to reflect on why Code Veronica is so special and how there possibly won't ever be another game like it.
