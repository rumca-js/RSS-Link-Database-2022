In this video we have over 8 minutes of catching, dodging, and battling a bunch of different Pok\u00e9mon while doing our best to keep our team from fainting!\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Legends Arceus is out now, and we've got some sick gameplay showing off one of the more interesting parts of the Hisui region: the random and rare Space-Time Distortion mini-event. In this video, we're going to show over 8 minutes of gameplay of us going into these distortion fields and engaging with several powerful Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe game has vast open areas where wild Pok\u00e9mon will roam, but if you linger in a region long enough, a notification will appear that a Space-Time Distortion field is nearby. There's not a lot of information explaining\u00a0why\u00a0these fields occur, but if you explore one of them, you'll quickly notice a lot of powerful and, at times, aggressive Pok\u00e9mon appearing.\n\nThe distortion field shows dangerous Pok\u00e9mon, but there are plenty of rare items on the ground, too, like Nuggets or even evolution items like the Electirizer. You'll also notice two clips: the first is our original experience with the field where we didn't know what to expect. The second half of the video is in the distortion field with a stronger team, which means more successful battles and catches!\n\nIf you want more Pok\u00e9mon, subscribe to our channel, as we'll have plenty of guides and features for Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus coming your way!\n\n#Pokemon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCDM_iQwpsE", "date_published": "2022-01-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sekiro Speedrunner Breaks Down Blindfold GDQ Run", "description": "At AGDQ 2022, Mitchriz completed Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in just over two hours completely blindfolded.
