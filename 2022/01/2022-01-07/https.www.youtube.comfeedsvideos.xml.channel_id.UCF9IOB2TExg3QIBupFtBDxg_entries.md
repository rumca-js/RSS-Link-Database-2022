Nature and causation of disease
Disease or dis - ease

Aetiology
endogenous  - arising within the organism
exogenous   - originating outside the organism

Genetic
Congenital disorders
Deficiency
Teratogenic
Infections
Rhesus incompatibility

Exogenous disease

Mechanical causes
temperature
radiation
atmospheric pressure
electricity

Chemical causes
Effects may be local or systemic
Acids and alkalines
Heavy metals

United States omicron surge will continue

New York hospitals

Incidental positives 50% to 65%

Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician

We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations

But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves

We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., 

we’re not intubating as many patients, 

and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged

France, Omicron wave

Prof Alain Fischer

I think we are coming to the peak of this new wave
primarily towards the beginning of the second fortnight of January, 

so if we work it out this would be in around 10 days’ time

Sir David Spiegelhalter, University of Cambridge

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-59902498

There's still no sign of a serious increase in intensive care ventilation and deaths, 

and we would have expected to see that by now

Hospitalisations in England, with good luck they won't go above 3,000

This is down to the fact that people have voluntarily been very cautious about their behaviour

London has peaked 31st December

London hospital admission fall below 400 per day line

Flu numbers still low
