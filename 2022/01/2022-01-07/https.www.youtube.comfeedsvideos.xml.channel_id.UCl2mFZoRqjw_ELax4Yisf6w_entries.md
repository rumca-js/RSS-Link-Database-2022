00:00 Sunny being ridiculous
00:21 Intro
01:55 Reading CNN article on DA memo
06:22 Suspicion CNN is hiding something
07:30 Reading the ACTUAL memo
12:55 Aggravated unlicensed operation
14:24 Resisting arrest
15:06 Prostitution
15:41 Obscenity & adultery
17:11 Diversion option NOT for violent crimes
17:50 Using judgment on crimes of poverty/mental illness
18:18 Would Eugene be a crime of poverty?
19:32 Robbery as a MISDEMEANOR?
20:14 It gets spicier
22:43 First degree robbery becomes a misdemeanor
29:03 Why CNN sucks
29:22 From English to algebra, and why controversial elements are legalspeak
31:11 Weapons possession from felony to misdemeanor
33:46 Burglary with deadly weapon prosecuted like there was no weapon
34:51 Commercial burglaries
35:50 Drug cases
39:32 Health concerns
41:14 Missed court dates
44:37 No life without parole
44:43 "Restorative justice"
45:14 This is a meme
48:05 Louis is a moron
50:08 Encouraging intimidation via "restorative justice"
51:01 Sunny goes to jail
54:58 immigration consequences(or lack thereof)
55:34 My conclusion
57:25 CNN was incorrect by omission
59:25 It is not true that NY will not charge you for committing a robbery

"160.15 is robbery in the first degree, a class B felony https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/160.15
155.25 is petit larceny, a class A misdemeanor. https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/155.25"
