It appears in hundreds of movies and games, from The Matrix to Call of Duty, Max Payne to Austin Powers, but despite its prominence in our favorite media, it is seldom seen in the real world. So how did a gun that sees almost no serious use get so much pop culture attention?\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to find out why the Desert Eagle might not be the all-conquering weapon that games and movies would have you believe.\u00a0\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Loadout right here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSrmGkpWKk&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMzIemU1gyyLmg5VlKI2UvC\n\nYou can check out our Firearms Expert Reacts series here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FVzcoRjoN4&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eqWe_wFcxE", "date_published": "2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered's Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered, including the iconic Intervention sniper rifle, the Aug assault rifle, and a gold Desert Eagle embraced by a teddy bear.\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered and compares them to their real-life counterparts.\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T78VQoWUs&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can either purchase Jonathan's book here. - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020\n\nYou can subscribe to the Armax Journal that Jonathan Associate Edited here: https://www.armaxjournal.org/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4hTzvlwKLk", "date_published": "2022-01-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
