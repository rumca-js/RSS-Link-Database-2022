[{"source": "https://jeang3nie.codeberg.page", "title": "The case for a modern language", "description": "There is a difference of opinion among many programmers regarding the idea of replacing C, either in newly wrritten code or else altogether. I find myself coming down on the side that it makes little sense to try to replace a legacy codebase, and still find C useful in some contexts (particularly in the realm of microcontrollers). That said I think a strong case can be made for using one of the several more modern languages that have sprung up in the systems programming space, at least for newly written code.", "link": "https://jeang3nie.codeberg.page/case-for-modern-language-pt1/", "date_published": "2022-01-22 20:41:43.054514+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en"}]
