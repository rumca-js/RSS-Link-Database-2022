00:00 Start of video
00:16 Lenovo & AMD vendor locking CPUs
00:35 Disclaimer 1 - Pro Lenovo bias

03:22 How it works

10:02 This feature is in demand
10:14 Comments on implementation
12:02 What I find to be the issue
13:48 If they let you choose on initial boot, this would be less of an issue

17:00 The difference between customer demand for a feature vs. company being evil
18:50 CORRECT ME!
