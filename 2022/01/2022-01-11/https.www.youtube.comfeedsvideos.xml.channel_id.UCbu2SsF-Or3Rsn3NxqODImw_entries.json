Meanwhile we have the PC version running on maxed out \u201cultra\u201d settings at a native 4K resolution.\n\nThe PC version does offer a small but decent number of improvements such as increased texture quality and dynamic fog. However, these can be pretty subtle. You will notice a major difference in shadows, which can change some scenes quite dramatically. Also, you will notice a difference in color, however that has more to do with how these games were captured on different devices and is not indicative of any real difference between the two versions.\n\nCheck out some Ultrawide gameplay here: https://youtu.be/5hkK2A8i6hM\n\n#GodofWar", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zZ0C91rsn4", "date_published": "2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite's Mangler Might Get Nerfed & Players Are Divided | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite\u2019s Mangler possibly getting nerfed, Horizon Forbidden West leaking early and Among Us becoming the PlayStation Store\u2019s most downloaded game in December 2021.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, Persia explains why players are divided over Halo Infinite's weapon, the Mangler, possibly getting nerfed.

A \"focused\" playthrough of the game's main story can be finished in about 20 hours depending on your playstyle. That playtime gets bumped to about 80 hours including all side quests and then, 500 hours including \u201cevery collectible, listen to every dialogue, fetch every Easter egg, finish every possible ending, and visit every corner of the world,\"\n\nPersia also talks about Grand Theft Auto company Take-Two acquiring FarmVille company Zynga for $12.7 billion, which the company announced on Monday morning. In a slide deck, Take-Two said it sees a \"clear path\" for bringing Take-Two's console and PC games to mobile, thanks in part to the Zynga deal. It did not, however, name any specific titles.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about a video uploaded by ER-SA that shows off the incomplete character creation in Elden Ring. While Elden Ring's character creation menu is by no means in a finished state, it does provide a good look at the game's improved character models. A majority of the basic options look decently realistic, sporting impressively rendered hair.\n\nLink to full ER-SA video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh_G4ARUSDw\u00a0\n\nFor more information on all of our topics today, please visit gamespot.com.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mng7FPteljE", "date_published": "2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
