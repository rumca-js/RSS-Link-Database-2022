God of War is the latest Sony title to get a PC port, so let's see how it compares to its console counterpart. 

For the PlayStation version we are running it on a PS5 with the upgraded “enhanced performance” patch that runs the game at 60fps with a 4K checkerboard resolution. Meanwhile we have the PC version running on maxed out “ultra” settings at a native 4K resolution.

The PC version does offer a small but decent number of improvements such as increased texture quality and dynamic fog. However, these can be pretty subtle. You will notice a major difference in shadows, which can change some scenes quite dramatically. Also, you will notice a difference in color, however that has more to do with how these games were captured on different devices and is not indicative of any real difference between the two versions.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Dying Light 2 taking up to 500 hours for a 100% run, Take-Two acquiring Zynga for $12.7 billion, and more.

Players will need to spend about 500 hours to "fully complete" Dying Light 2, developer Techland has confirmed, while also acknowledging that this is the projected run time for a 100% run. A "focused" playthrough of the game's main story can be finished in about 20 hours depending on your playstyle. That playtime gets bumped to about 80 hours including all side quests and then, 500 hours including “every collectible, listen to every dialogue, fetch every Easter egg, finish every possible ending, and visit every corner of the world,"

Persia also talks about Grand Theft Auto company Take-Two acquiring FarmVille company Zynga for $12.7 billion, which the company announced on Monday morning. In a slide deck, Take-Two said it sees a "clear path" for bringing Take-Two's console and PC games to mobile, thanks in part to the Zynga deal. It did not, however, name any specific titles.

Lastly, Persia talks about a video uploaded by ER-SA that shows off the incomplete character creation in Elden Ring. While Elden Ring's character creation menu is by no means in a finished state, it does provide a good look at the game's improved character models. A majority of the basic options look decently realistic, sporting impressively rendered hair.
