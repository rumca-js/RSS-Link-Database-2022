SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly achieved global dissemination,\n\naccounting for most infections in the United States by December 2021. \n\nNovember 30, 2021 to January 1, 2022, Delta v Omicron\n\nUsing S gene

infections\n\nHospital admissions, 222 (1.3%)\n\nMean follow-up, 15.8 days\n\n189 admitted\n\nITU, 23\n\nVentilated, 11\n\nDeaths, 14\n\nAlso\n\nOmicron variant infection, reduced risk of hospitalization across age and comorbidity categories \n\nRisk of symptomatic hospitalization was markedly reduced among cases who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection \u226590 days prior\n\nIntrinsically less severe infection\n\nLess severe in vaccinated and unvaccinated\n\nEvidence for a reduction in severe outcomes among vaccinated cases with both Delta and Omicron variant infections in our study suggests substantial public health benefits from continued COVID-19 vaccination. \n\nDutch
