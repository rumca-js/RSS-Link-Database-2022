This week on Breakout we discuss the current landscape of media where a lot of companies are relying on nostalgia-baiting to capture audiences attention...some people like this, and others don't.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
