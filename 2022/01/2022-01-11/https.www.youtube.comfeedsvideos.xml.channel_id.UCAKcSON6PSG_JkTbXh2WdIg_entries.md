This week, Mary Lucia discusses the three-part documentary series, "Nuclear Family," streaming now on HBO Max.

In "Nuclear Family," filmmaker Ry Russo-Young turns the camera on her own family to explore the meaning and dynamics of family. Ry and her sister Cade were born to two lesbian mothers through sperm donors. In 1991, one of the donors brought a lawsuit for paternity and visitation rights. "[The film] goes through the the back-and-forth of the of the litigation and what that did to the nuclear family, hence the name," Mary says.

In sharing her story, Ry Russo-Young tells a larger story about how the way LGBTQ families are perceived was changed, and about how families come in many different forms. Watch more of what Mary has to say in the video above.
