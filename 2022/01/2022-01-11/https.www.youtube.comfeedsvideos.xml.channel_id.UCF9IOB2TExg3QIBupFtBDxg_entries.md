Background

The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly achieved global dissemination,

accounting for most infections in the United States by December 2021. 

November 30, 2021 to January 1, 2022, Delta v Omicron

Using S gene target failure (SGTF) (99.7%)

Hospital admission

Lengths of hospital stay

Hospital admissions associated with new-onset respiratory symptoms

Intensive care unit (ICU) admission

Mechanical ventilation

Mortality

Group 1, omicron

N =  52,297, cases with Omicron variant infections

Hospital admissions, 235 (0.5%)

Mean follow-up, 5.5 days

88 admitted

ITU, 7

Ventilated, 0

Deaths, 1

Length of hospital stay, 3.4 days (70%) less than delta

Group 2, non – omicron (delta)

N = 16,982, cases with Delta variant infections

Hospital admissions, 222 (1.3%)

Mean follow-up, 15.8 days

189 admitted

ITU, 23

Ventilated, 11

Deaths, 14

Also

Omicron variant infection, reduced risk of hospitalization across age and comorbidity categories 

Risk of symptomatic hospitalization was markedly reduced among cases who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection ≥90 days prior

Intrinsically less severe infection

Less severe in vaccinated and unvaccinated

Evidence for a reduction in severe outcomes among vaccinated cases with both Delta and Omicron variant infections in our study suggests substantial public health benefits from continued COVID-19 vaccination.

Cross-reactive memory T cells associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 contacts

Cross-reactive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2

52 COVID-19 household contacts

We enumerate the frequency of specific T cells 

Spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and ORF1,

that cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses

Nucleocapsid-specific T cells

Limited protective function of spike-cross-reactive T cells

Our results are thus consistent with,

pre-existing non-spike cross-reactive memory T cells,

protecting SARS-CoV-2-naïve contacts from infection, 

thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in second-generation vaccines.

Previous record, 132,051, January 2021

Ongoing staff out sick

Many elective procedures suspended

Schools

Staff, teachers, bus drivers

Next 6 to 8 weeks

More than half of people in Europe could be infected

Hans Kluge, director for Europe

a new west-to-east tidal wave sweeping across the region

The region saw over seven million cases of Covid-19 in the first week of 2022,

more than doubling over a two-week period

26 countries, more than 1 % being infected per week
Boosters, play an essential role in protecting the most vulnerable people from severe disease

Also for health workers, teachers

Lower vaccination rates

Balkans and Eastern Europe

For countries not yet hit with the omicron surge, there is a closing window to act now and plan for contingencies

France, Prime Minister Jean Castex

If we were to shut down classes as soon as there is one first case, 

bearing in mind the explosion of Omicron, 

all French schools would be closed in a matter of days

Catherine Smallwood, W.H.O. senior emergencies officer

Some sense of predictability needed to move from pandemic to endemic

We are still ways off

We still have a huge amount of uncertainty
