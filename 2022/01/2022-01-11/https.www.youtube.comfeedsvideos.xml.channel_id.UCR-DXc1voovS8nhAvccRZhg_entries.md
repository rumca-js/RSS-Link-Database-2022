ArduCam has a new 16 megapixel Autofocus camera for the Raspberry Pi. Is it worth $25? You bet! But it's not all roses and butterflies. The software isn't up to speed yet, and the autofocus might not work quite like you'd expect.

The camera was initially launched via Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arducam/high-resolution-autofocus-camera-module-for-raspberry-pi

You should be able to buy the camera soonâ€”check out https://www.arducam.com for more information.
