Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! This week is SPECIAL, probably my favorite one I have made yet. I went to Las Vegas to CES this year and got to try out all sorts of VR technology from haptic gloves, haptic vests, teslasuits, electrostimulation suits, and cheap widely available full body tracking. 

This week is very special!
