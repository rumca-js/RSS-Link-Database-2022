This is what a cyberwar looks like. The 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia became largely considered to be the first cyber warfare in Internet history.

To understand what can be realistically done with cyberwarfare, it serves best to look at the real world instead of hypothetical scenarios. One such cyber campaign was waged against one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. It was the 2007 cyberwar in Estonia. 

The face of the cyberwar will most likely take the form of skirmishes that take days or weeks at a time. A full-scale campaign on an entire nation’s infrastructure is only a viable threat to smaller countries mostly without military alliances. Waging such a massive cyber campaign is most effective when coordinated with kinetic force. But on its own, cyber offensive will eventually run out of resources and time and the defense will adapt. 

The cyberwar in Estonia was successful mostly because it likely had hundreds or thousands of spontaneous participants. But Estonia’s economy didn’t crumble and the society bounced back to normal quickly after the attacks were fended off.
