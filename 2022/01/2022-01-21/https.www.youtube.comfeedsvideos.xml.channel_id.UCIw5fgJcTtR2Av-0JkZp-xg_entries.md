Support my music on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/yuriwong A tour of my home studio, which is a combination of hardware and software workflows. Logic Pro X is my DAW of choice. I can compose and arrange DAWless using my hardware equipment only and then transfer the results to Logic for further editing and mixing. Fully in-the-box productions for film scores and soundtrack work are also possible, as Logic hosts my orchestral and other sample libraries from Spitfire Audio, Native Instruments and more.
