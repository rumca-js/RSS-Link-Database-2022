I ask Dr. Jordan Person about his mainstream media interviews where he felt under attacked and if  he has any regrets about how he spoke or behaved during them? Does he ever see value in his opponents views and is here a middle ground? He answers passionately here about the importance and necessity of free speech and its role in our individual lives and society at large.

No one likes a thief, right? Thankfully we can rely on the mainstream corporate media to bring to our attention all the worst crimes that we should definitely care most about and seek punishment over. Such as shoplifting and definitely not extreme corporate theft.
