Omicron did not establish in schools pre-holiday

Pathogenicity of omicron

No infection, no vaccine

One third drop in risk of hospital admission

Two thirds drop in the risk of dying from Omicron

Australia

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-04/nsw-records-highest-hospitalisation-and-covid-cases/100736056

NSW, cases, + 23,131

Positivity, 27.24%

Hospitalised + 140 = 1,344

ICU, + 10 = 105

Ventilated = 27

COVID positive patients admitted to ICU since December 16, delta = 72%

Of those patients, 62% not vaccinated or only one dose

Regional Victoria

It is like our government has thrown its arms in the air
 
But now it is ridiculous how far the polar opposite we have gone, it is night and day!!! 

Now we have a wildfire of COVID here in the Alpine Shire. 

Very limited testing, delays on PCR results

Rapid Antigen tests, SOLD OUT !!! can't get them

A close contact definition, same house, more than 4 hours
 
I could go on for several paragraphs with further details on how crazy it seems to have become down here in Australia

in the coming weeks I would think we will see an explosion in cases here Victoria & especially Melbourne

Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission in South African health care workers who received a homologous booster of Ad26.COV2 during an Omicron COVID19 wave

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.28.21268436v1.full.pdf

Ad26.COV.2 vaccine

N = 477, 234 HCWs 

6-9 months after first dose

N = 69,092 HCW (evaluated)

VE for hospitalisation (post boost)

Compared to unvaccinated individuals 

0-13 days, 63%

14-27 days, 84%

1-2 months, 85%

JCVI, Sir Andrew Pollard, 

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/03/fourth-covid-jab-cant-vaccinate-planet-every-six-months-says/

Fourth jabs should not be offered until there is more evidence

Giving boosters to people every six months not sustainable

At some point, society has to open up.
 
When we do open, there will be a period with a bump in infections, which is why winter is probably not the best time.

But that’s a decision for the policy makers, not the scientists. 

Our approach has to switch, 

to rely on the vaccines and the boosters. 

The greatest risk is still the unvaccinated.

The worst is absolutely behind us. 

We just need to get through the winter.

Misinformation (AZ)

One year ago

Some European leaders

(France and Germany, efficacy on the over-65s, risk of blood clots)

highly likely to have cost lives in Africa

Misinformation risks people’s lives. 

It’s highly likely that people became seriously ill and died because of vaccine misinformation

Let’s just say that comments made in mainland Europe affected people in Africa

## Science indicates less severe omicron disease

Record infections

Plans to reopen economy

Prime Minister Scott Morrison

We have to stop thinking about case numbers and think about serious illness,

living with the virus, 

managing our own health and ensuring that we're monitoring those symptoms 

and we keep our economy going

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/all-of-us-are-going-to-be-exposed-to-omicron-queensland-chief-health-officer-warns

Queensland, chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard

Omicron, peak at very large numbers in late January or early February

We are expecting in the next few weeks very substantial numbers of people are going to be infected 

I think we just have to assume that all of us are going to be exposed in the next few weeks

we can expect very large numbers of cases
and in the majority of cases, 

the vast majority of cases, 
the symptoms will be mild
 
So clearly the vaccine is working

Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk

What we’re doing is telling people to go and get vaccinated. 

We have … given every Queenslander in this state the opportunity to get vaccinated

I’m now urging people in those Indigenous communities to ignore those social media posts and immediately go and get your vaccination


SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant replication in human respiratory tract ex vivo 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1189219/v1

Omicron infects and multiplies 70 times faster than the Delta in human bronchus

Omicron variant replicated 10 times less in human lung tissue than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus 

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 Variant leads to less severe disease than Pango B and Delta variants strains in a mouse model of severe COVID-19

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.474085v2

Mice infected with Delta compared to mice infected with Omicron

Less severe clinical signs (weight loss)

Lower virus loads

Less extensive inflammation in the lungs

T cell epitopes probably conserved

Clinical consequences of infection with the 
Omicron variant may be less severe,

but the higher transmissibility could still place huge burden upon healthcare systems



The omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern does not readily infect Syrian hamsters

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.24.474086v1

All other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in Syrian hamsters

In hamsters that had been infected with omicron, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs

No infectious virus was detectable in the lungs

Histopathological examination, lungs from omicron-infected hamsters, no signs pneumonia. 










The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron virus causes attenuated infection and disease in mice and hamsters 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1211792/v1

B.1.1.529 Omicron isolates

Immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2) 

Expressing mice and hamsters

Attenuated lung disease

Not as ill

Lower viral loads



SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells

https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.20105114

The hyper-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant exhibits significant antigenic change, vaccine escape and a switch in cell entry mechanism 

https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/cvr/engage/news/headline_829358_en.html

https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_829360_smxx.pdf

Omicron, markedly decreased neutralisation in serology

In order

Three doses of vaccine

Immunity from natural infection (without vaccination)

Two doses of vaccine

Omicron, compared to Delta and Wuhan D614G

Titres of the Omicron variant in lung tissue,

were at least an order of magnitude lower at each time point compared to the other two variants

This is consistent with attenuated replication of Omicron in lower respiratory tissues as recently reported
