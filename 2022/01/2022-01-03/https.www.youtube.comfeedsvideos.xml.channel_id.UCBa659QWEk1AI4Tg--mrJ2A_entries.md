Mannequins are generally bought, used once for a project, and then thrown away to landfill. Except here, at Mannakin in Lincolnshire. Thanks to Roz and the team at Mannakin: https://mannakin.com

My first thought was "don't those mannequins rot, just sitting out there in the weather?" And then I realised: no, not really, they're fibreglass. That's part of the problem Mannakin's trying to help with!
