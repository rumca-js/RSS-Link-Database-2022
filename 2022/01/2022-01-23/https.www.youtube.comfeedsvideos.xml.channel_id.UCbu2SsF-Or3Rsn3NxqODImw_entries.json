It appears in hundreds of movies and games, from The Matrix to Call of Duty, Max Payne to Austin Powers, but despite its prominence in our favorite media, it is seldom seen in the real world. So how did a gun that sees almost no serious use get so much pop culture attention?\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to find out why the Desert Eagle might not be the all-conquering weapon that games and movies would have you believe.\u00a0\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Loadout right here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSrmGkpWKk&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMzIemU1gyyLmg5VlKI2UvC\n\nYou can check out our Firearms Expert Reacts series here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FVzcoRjoN4&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eqWe_wFcxE", "date_published": "2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
