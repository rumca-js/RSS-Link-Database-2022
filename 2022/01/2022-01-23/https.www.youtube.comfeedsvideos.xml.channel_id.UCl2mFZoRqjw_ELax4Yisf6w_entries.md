00:00 Start of video
00:16 Lenovo & AMD vendor locking CPUs
00:35 Disclaimer 1 - Pro Lenovo bias
01:53 Disclaimer 2 - Populist worldview
02:29 Disclaimer 3 - I'm an idiot
02:56 Let's get into it
03:22 How it works
03:39 Intel ME & the PCH
05:35 AMD has no PCH
05:40 Weird that this is going into low end systems
06:35 What security features?
08:25 It is up to the VENDOR!
10:02 This feature is in demand
10:14 Comments on implementation
12:02 What I find to be the issue
13:48 If they let you choose on initial boot, this would be less of an issue
14:50 The recycling supply chain will be ruined by this
17:00 The difference between customer demand for a feature vs. company being evil
18:50 CORRECT ME!
