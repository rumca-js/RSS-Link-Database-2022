Who killed Wharlest Jackson? In the upcoming documentary “American Reckoning,” an unsolved 1960s murder reveals an untold story of the civil rights movement and Black resistance. 

“American Reckoning” premieres on FRONTLINE (PBS) on Tuesday, February 15 at 10/9c. 

From FRONTLINE and Retro Report with support from Chasing the Dream, the feature-length documentary draws on rarely seen footage filmed more than 50 years ago in Natchez, Mississippi, and follows the Jackson family’s search for justice.

“American Reckoning” is the latest component in FRONTLINE’s ongoing “Un(re)solved” project — an unprecedented, multiplatform investigation of civil rights era cold case killings that includes a web interactive experience; podcast mini-series; augmented-reality installation that can tour schools, libraries, and museums; a companion educational curriculum; and events.
