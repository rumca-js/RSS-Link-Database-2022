One omicron infection detected in Beijing

Tuesday, 11th January, received a package from Toronto, via the US and Hong Kong (4 days)

Saturday 15th Patient self reported 
Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of Beijing’s CDC

Omicron virus transmits fast, please pay attention, avoid buying stuff from overseas, make sure you wear gloves, don’t bring the package indoors.

If you have to, clean the package outside with alcohol, and wash your hands

Dr Ian Mackay, virologist, University of Queensland

It’s an airborne virus. It’s not about surfaces. Technically, it can happen, sure. 

There’s a non-zero risk, sure. But is it happening again and again? No

SARS-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces and the survival of the virus on certain surfaces,

there are no specific reports which have directly demonstrated fomite transmission. 

People who come into contact with potentially infectious surfaces often also have close contact with the infectious person,

The NHS is offering COVID-19 vaccine to children and young people aged 12 to 17 years

Two doses of vaccine 12 weeks apart

(or 12 weeks after a positive test)

Reduce further the "very, very small risk" of myocarditis in under-18s

UK, giving Pfizer rather than moderna

https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-vaccine-your-questions-answered/covid-19-vaccines-and-myocarditis-should-you-be-worried

Can the Covid-19 vaccine cause myocarditis?

In most cases of myocarditis, heart function returns to normal. 

Cases, while still very rare, are slightly less rare in children and young people. 

It's still the case that millions of children around the world have had a Covid vaccine, virtually all of them without long term side effects. 

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not been linked to an increased risk of myocarditis. 

Getting Covid-19 can itself lead to myocarditis, as well as other forms of severe illness. 

Who is at risk from myocarditis following the vaccine?

Mostly affected young men aged 12 to 29

Usually after their second dose

Israel study, up to 4 in 100,000 men

Women was fewer than one in 100,000

Are children and young people at higher risk of heart inflammation from the vaccine?

Cases of heart inflammation after the vaccine, 

while still very rare, are slightly less rare in children and younger adults (up to the age of 39) 

UK up to 15 December 2021, 12 to 17 year olds

39 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis

(18 cases per million doses of vaccine)

18-29 year olds

29 per million doses

30-39 year-olds

22 per million doses

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and 4 CMOs confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective for children aged 12 to 15, 

as well as vulnerable children from the age of five. 

Is there a risk of cardiac arrest from the Covid vaccine?

No. There is no evidence that people are at risk of cardiac arrest in the days or weeks following the vaccine.

Denmark has changed their national guidelines https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/... Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.

Evidence from Dr. Peter Gaillard (microparticulate pharmacologist) https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/astraz... 

Denmark v Norway

Myocarditis 3 times more prevalent in Norway
Found there were no deaths or diagnoses of heart failure in people who were diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis after being vaccinated. 

In the UK, no figures have been published for cardiac arrests in under-18s following the vaccine, 

which means there have been a tiny number too small to be published, or none at all.
Catching Covid-19, on the other hand, can significantly increase your risk of cardiac arrest and death. 

Is there any link between the Covid-19 vaccine and cardiac arrests at football matches?

No, there isn’t.


Feeling like you need to be sick
 
I’ve heard about people getting myocarditis after the vaccine and I’m worried. Should I have my second dose/ booster dose? 

Yes. It’s recommended that you have your second dose or booster dose, if you are eligible. 
 
I was diagnosed with myocarditis after having the vaccine. Should I go ahead and book my second dose/ booster dose?

No, you should get advice from your health professional
