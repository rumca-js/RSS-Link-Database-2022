In Today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about Battlefield 2042 Season 1 being delayed again, the New York Times buying Wordle, and more.

DICE has outlined its plans for the future of Battlefield 2042, and unfortunately, this includes delaying the launch of Season 1 to sometime this summer.

DICE said in a statement "We are heavily invested and committed to the future of Battlefield 2042--working on taking action on multiple fronts to address feedback and implement extensive fixes to the game.”

Messaging platform Discord has confirmed that it is now "gradually rolling out" to US PlayStation console users. Support for additional countries will follow in time, and the process for linking your PlayStation console to the app is similar to linking most devices.

It's been a big month for acquisitions, and here’s another one for the list. The New York Times has bought Wordle, the viral daily word game. Creator Josh Wardle says he is working with the Times to move the game over to the NYT site, where it will "initially" remain free, with your current win streaks and other records intact.
