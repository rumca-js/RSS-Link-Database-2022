<p>Reading Sue Gray’s interim report, it’s hard to believe that the people who made the law had obeyed the law</p><p>The interim <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/what-sue-gray-edited-report-into-alleged-lockdown-parties-says" title="">findings</a> of a report by the civil servant Sue Gray are damning of the culture at the heart of Boris Johnson’s government. Ms Gray cited “failures of leadership and judgment”; “excessive” consumption of alcohol in the workplace; and officials cowed into silence about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Ms Gray said she has been “extremely limited” by a police investigation and was unable to make firm conclusions about what she had discovered. However, Ms Gray’s report suggests that some of the events she examined didn’t comply with lockdown rules, saying that “a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did”. Reading this, it’s hard to believe that the people who made the law had obeyed the law.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s argument to MPs had been that the Downing Street parties were not parties because lockdown guidance had been heeded. The Johnson logic was that since the rules said there could be no party, whatever happened wasn’t a party. The trouble with this reasoning is that Ms Gray has amassed enough evidence for the police to investigate a dozen potential criminal breaches of Covid rules in Mr Johnson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties" title="">home</a> and office. The Met has 300 photographs and 500 pieces of paper from Ms Gray, which only raise the stakes for Tory MPs. This feels more like the vapour trail from a cruise missile than the wispy smoke coming off a warm gun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-a-pm-without-shame">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the care-leaving age: teenagers are children too | Editorial

<p>There should be a national outcry about the government’s decision to withhold the entitlement to care from the over-15s</p><p>Terry Galloway and his siblings grew up in care. His sister had a difficult life, which ended when she was murdered by a partner. As children, the Galloways made a pact to try to improve the care system, which is part of the reason why he will travel to Downing Street as part of a delegation of care leavers on Tuesday. Their petition objects to a new law that, because it took the form of secondary legislation, has so far failed to generate the national outcry that it merits. That law makes official in England the practice of forcing children out of care at the age of 16. </p><p>Between 2018 and 2020, while living in this type of setting, <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2021-10-27/64629" title="">22 children aged 16 and 17 died</a>. The government won’t say which councils were responsible for these children, but a review following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-58986059" title="">death of Caitlin Sharp</a> criticised Worcestershire social services, and said that she should not have been living independently, partly due to her epilepsy. Forcing children to manage life on their own leads to other forms of harm too. Last year, the Together Trust found that <a href="https://www.togethertrust.org.uk/news/new-research-wheres-care" title="">3,253 16- and 17-year-olds</a> were not in education, employment or training while living in non-care settings.

Twelve parties – all but four of those that took place – are under criminal investigation. One of those, and this is not a passing detail, took place in the prime minister’s own flat. While the rest of the country was negotiating the fine technicalities of what constitutes a breach of the rules, in some instances pondering whether to sit on a bench in the park or not, these parties seem to suggest that No 10 and civil service staff, under the eye of the prime minister, believed they were exempt.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-no-10-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

The allowance was introduced when racing emerged from lockdown in June 2020, but with weighing-room saunas off-limits to maintain social distancing. Jockeys – or the 250 or so who responded to a survey – subsequently voted to keep the saunas closed, but apparently in the expectation that the 3lb allowance would be retained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/31/talking-horses-listen-to-jockeys-in-battle-of-the-scales-with-racings-rulers-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Photographer Dmitry Kokh discovered polar bears living in an abandoned weather station in Kolyuchin, in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation, while on a trip to Wrangel Island, a Unesco-recognised nature reserve that serves as a refuge to the animals</p><p>I had dreamed about photographing polar bears for a long time. Some time ago my hobby, wildlife photography, ceased to be just a hobby and turned into a large part of my life. And if you devote so much time to an activity then your goals should be ambitious. Most of all I like to take pictures of large marine animals, whether on land or under water. Not everyone knows, but zoologists classify polar bears as marine mammals since they spend most of their time on ice floes away from land. And their paws even have webbing.</p><p>There are only a few places on the planet where polar bears can be found in large numbers. One of them is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/russia-investigators-polar-bear-abuser-explosive">Russia’s Wrangel Island</a>, a nature reserve under Unesco protection that is often called a polar bear maternity ward. The place is very inaccessible, which may be bad for tourists but is great for the animals.</p><p>Polar bears living in an abandoned weather station in Kolyuchin, in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/polar-bears-move-into-abandoned-arctic-weather-station-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New passion for reviving country’s monuments is returning Little Theatre of Epidavros to heart of community</p><p>For nearly two millennia, the Little Theatre of Epidavros lay underground. Its engraved seats, concentric and tiered, belonged to a world of roots; in this case the roots of an olive grove owned by Christos Zafiris, a local farmer. “They say that had it not been for pigs digging at the soil, we might never have known of its existence,” says Prof Vassilis Lambrinoudakis. “Until the appearance of the stones in 1970, the theatre was a secret hidden under the earth for 18 centuries.”</p><p>The classical archaeologist, renowned for his work at Athens University, has spent more than four decades ensuring the chance find would not go to waste. Excavations have not disappointed. Inscriptions discovered at the site, on the slopes of a peninsula overlooking the sea, have shed light on the history of those who may have commissioned the theatre. Evidence of multiple phases of construction, starting in the mid-fourth<sup> </sup>century BC, have further illuminated the ancient city of Epidavros that once surrounded the architectural gem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/31/there-is-nothing-more-magical-resurrected-theatre-brings-ancient-greece-to-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the Grenfell inquiry heads towards its concluding stages, politicians will be called to account for their part in the deadly fire. Our social affairs correspondent Robert Booth has been watching on throughout</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/07/how-to-listen-to-podcasts-everything-you-need-to-know?CMP=podcast-help">How to listen to podcasts: everything you need to know</a></p><p>The fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower on 14 June 2017 was one of the UK’s worst modern disasters. Seventy-two people died after a fire broke out in one of the apartments and quickly spread to the floors above as combustible cladding on the outside of the building went up in flames.</p><p>The Grenfell Tower inquiry was set up to establish the factors that led to the tragedy and to make recommendations for how to avoid anything similar ever happening again. It has heard from hundreds of witnesses and has looked at the disaster from multiple viewpoints: from the residents, the fire brigade, the developers and the cladding firms. Now in the next phase the inquiry will begin hearing from the politicians who set the regulatory framework that builders and contractors worked within.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/jan/31/grenfell-inquiry-final-phase-will-politicians-be-held-accountable">Continue reading...</a>
