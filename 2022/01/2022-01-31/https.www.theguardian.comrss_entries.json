Ms Gray cited \u201cfailures of leadership and judgment\u201d; \u201cexcessive\u201d consumption of alcohol in the workplace; and officials cowed into silence about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Ms Gray said she has been \u201cextremely limited\u201d by a police investigation and was unable to make firm conclusions about what she had discovered. However, Ms Gray\u2019s report suggests that some of the events she examined didn\u2019t comply with lockdown rules, saying that \u201ca number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did\u201d.
