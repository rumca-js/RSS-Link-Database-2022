Omicron wave, peaked in NSW and Victoria?

Prof Adrian Esterman, epidemiologist and biostatistician, University of South Australia

R is less than one

NSW, 0.83

Victoria, 0.8
absolutely certainly peaked in NSW and Victoria

I would expect to see hospitalisations starting to come down now

Victoria, chief health officer, Brett Sutton, Monday

Case numbers were close to peaking

Expected number of people in hospital would increase

 


NSW 
 

NSW, Hospital numbers should begin to plateau this week.

United States, I believe you may be misinterpreting the cause for the multitude of hospitalizations in the US. 

There is an economic incentive, as hospitals are reimbursed for covid patients and not so for other illnesses. 

Co-morbidity? - sure, but the incentive is to hospitalize and pray for covid to be present, or to hospitalize when marginally necessary to rake in the covid bounty.

In just two weeks, the number of new cases per day has fallen around 31% 

from its peak of over 211,000 to under 145,000

Uptick in symptomatic cases in children due to the back to school effect. 
PM

Return to plan A, lifting plan B

As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others

LFTs

400 million LFTs this month

Free tests planned to end in July
(Currently £30 per pack of 7)

Up to November 2021

691 million lateral flow tests distributed

96 million (14%) registered result with NHS

Today

Ending guidance on working from home

No masks in classrooms

Next Thursday

Mandatory certifications will end

Face masks not legally mandated

March 24th (if not before)

End legal requirement to self-isolate

PM

soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether

Mr. Javid

Omicron is in retreat

We have not reached the finish line
Milestone, not an end

But it's not the end of the road and we shouldn't see this as the finish line

because we cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants

Instead we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we have to live with flu

Help keep the virus at bay, isolate if positive

Gat Jabbed

Dr Richard Cree, an intensive care consultant, Middlesbrough

I am confident that the worst will soon be behind us

Far fewer patients are unwell like they were back then (April, 2020) 

The Covid wards are no longer full of people struggling to breathe

The hospital is still finding it a challenge to cope with such a large number of patients

Social care staff shortages, clogged hospitals
