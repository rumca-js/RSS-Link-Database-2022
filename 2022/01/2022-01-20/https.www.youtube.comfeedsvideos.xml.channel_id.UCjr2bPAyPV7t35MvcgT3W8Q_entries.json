One such cyber campaign was waged against one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. It was the 2007 cyberwar in Estonia. \n\nThe face of the cyberwar will most likely take the form of skirmishes that take days or weeks at a time. A full-scale campaign on an entire nation\u2019s infrastructure is only a viable threat to smaller countries mostly without military alliances. Waging such a massive cyber campaign is most effective when coordinated with kinetic force. But on its own, cyber offensive will eventually run out of resources and time and the defense will adapt. \n\nThe cyberwar in Estonia was successful mostly because it likely had hundreds or thousands of spontaneous participants. But Estonia\u2019s economy didn\u2019t crumble and the society bounced back to normal quickly after the attacks were fended off. \n\nSources\nImmediate media coverage of the cyber attacks on Estonia\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/39655415\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-455467/Russia-launches-cyberwar-Estonia.html\nRussia accused\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/05/massive-ddos-attacks-target-estonia-russia-accused/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/oukin-uk-estonia-cyberwar-idUKL1847541120070518\nChronology of the cyber attacks\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/technology/29estonia.html\nCyber war timeline\nhttps://www.wired.com/2007/08/ff-estonia/\nResearch Paper on Estonia Cyberwar\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1105&context=jss\n\nWar In The Fifth Domain \nhttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/07/01/war-in-the-fifth-domain\n20-year-old Russian arrested\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7208511.stm\nMarkov Claims Responsibility\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090701212951/http://www.darkreading.com/blog/archives/2009/03/authoritatively.html\nKonstantin Goloskov from Nashi claims responsibility \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090716045103/http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1076297.html\nEstonian attacks were a cyber riot not a warfare\nhttps://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240082385/Estonian-attacks-were-a-cyber-riot-not-warfare\n\nAftermaths of the cyber war\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna31801246\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/it-services/how-to-fight-cyber-war-estonia-shows-the-way/articleshow/24274994.cms\nNATO's cyber defense in Estonia\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20080723185533/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/051508-nato-to-set-up-cyber.html\nhttps://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/240109/cyber-war-must-be-treated-as-conventional-attack-estonia\n\nE-stonia and E-Government\nhttps://e-estonia.com/how-estonia-became-a-global-heavyweight-in-cyber-security/\nhttps://qz.com/1052269/every-country-should-have-a-cyber-war-what-estonia-learned-from-russian-hacking/\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/02/opinions/estonia-cyber-war/\n\nCyber war on ISIS\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/us-military-launches-cyber-attacks-isis-432441\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/us-military-launches-cyber-attacks-on-isis-in-mosul-and-announces-it/\nAnonymous \nhttps://uk.news.yahoo.com/anonymous-threatens-isis-major-cyber-095356033.html?\n\nColonial Pipeline Cyber Attacks\nhttps://www.cyberscoop.com/gas-pipeline-cyberattack-ransomware-colonial/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/pipeline-hack.html\n\nNSA Exploit Leads to WannaCry\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers-just-dumped-its-most-damaging-release-yet/\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/an-nsa-derived-ransomware-worm-is-shutting-down-computers-worldwide/\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-14/ransomware-cyberattack-threat-lingers-as-people-return-to-work/8525554\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DwVpJxD1GE", "date_published": "2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
