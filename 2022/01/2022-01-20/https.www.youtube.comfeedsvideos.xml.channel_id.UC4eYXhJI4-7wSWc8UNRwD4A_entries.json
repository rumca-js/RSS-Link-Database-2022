We've tried to maintain the same spirit as the shows at my NPR desk \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just in a different space. The following biographical information about each performer was written by the globalFEST team.\n\nAl Bilali Soudan\nThe family members of Al Bilali Soudan, from Timbuktu, Mali, are sought-after musicians and griots. Led by Abellow Yattara, the band is a torch-bearer of quintessentially Tamasheq (or Tuareg) music, shaped by a continuous exchange between the tehardent (lute), vocals and hand percussion. The words sung are similarly percussive, like an instrument themselves. This genre of music has been performed for half a millennium by Tuareg griots to celebrate the end of harvest and the changing seasons, heroic warriors and noble families.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Apolo\"\n\"Djaba\"\n\nKiran Ahluwalia\nKiran Ahluwalia's original compositions embody the essence of Indian music while embracing influences from Mali and Western blues, rock, R&B and jazz. With her six-piece group of electric guitar, accordion, organ, tabla, bass and drum kit, Ahluwalia creates boundary-breaking songs that invite us to explore the human condition, transcending the self by losing ourselves in a trance of groove and melody. The two-time JUNO and Songlines award winner's open-hearted vocals have positioned her as one of global music's most compelling cross-pollinators.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dil\"\n\"Rabba Ru\"\n\"We Sinful Women\"\n\nTufan Derince\nTufan Derince, a young Kurdish musician from Diyarbakir in southeast Turkey, is a master of the elektro ba\u011flama, an electrified version of the ba\u011flama of Turkish folk music. Now based in Rotterdam, he is in high demand as a performer at events integral to the cultural lives of Kurdish communities throughout Europe and across Turkey.\n\nDerince made his U.S. debut at globalFEST in New York in 2020, which led to glowing coverage from NPR, The New York Times, and Songlines, and invitations to other international festivals like Dubai Expo 2020 and SXSW.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Govend\"\n\"Gran\u00ee\"\n\"Delilo\"\n\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST ARTISTIC TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nGLOBALFEST PRODUCTION TEAM\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThe Andrew W.

The following biographical information about each performer was written by the globalFEST team.\n\nKombilesa M\u00ed\nBorn from the rich musical and historical heritage of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia (the first free Black town in the Americas), Kombilesa M\u00ed fuses the traditional sounds of the community with urban pop. The band's members experiment with the instruments created by their ancestors (and introduced to them when they were young) by layering them between new sounds.\n\nOver traditional percussion, metal handmade drums of their own design, and mar\u00edmbula, Kombilesa M\u00ed rhymes and raps in Spanish and the traditional Palenquero language, a fusion of African Bantu, Portuguese, French and English. During the performance, you'll hear them call their music \"RFP,\" which means Rap Folkl\u00f3rico Palenquero, a combo of cumbia, son de negro, mapal\u00e9 and son palenquero.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I tando pa palenge\"\n\"I a piy\u00e1 b\u00f3\"\n\"Kumo kusa t\u00e1\"\n\"Los peinados\"\n\"Asina gue\"\n\"Ma Nduse\"\n\"Ata uto beg\u00e1\"\n\nNorthern Cree\nNorthern Cree is a powwow and round dance act, based in Maskwacis, Alberta, Canada. Formed in 1982 by the Wood brothers \u2013 Steve, Randy, Charlie and Earl Wood of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation \u2013 most members originate from the Treaty 6 and are members of the Cree Nation. This year marks Northern Cree's 40th birthday as a group.\n\nNorthern Cree has recorded 50 albums and been nominated for a GRAMMY nine times. They made history in 2017 when they became the first powwow group to perform at the Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. They recorded this performance at the powwow arbor of the Tsuut'ina Nation.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Dream\"\n\"Kohkominaw\"\n\"Storytelling Warrior\"\n\nSon Rompe Pera\nBorn and raised in the deep outskirts of Mexico City, the three Gama brothers are keeping alive the rich legacy of marimba music running through their family. Originally performing alongside their father at local events as kids, they now find themselves at the forefront of the contemporary international cumbia scene with their sonic explorations of the classic marimba.\n\nFrom the Sal\u00f3n Los \u00c1ngeles in Mexico City, this quintet urges listeners to their feet with their unique style of garage-marimba-cumbia rock, played on the historic marimba like no one has ever heard or seen before.\n\nSET LIST\n\"La Tortuga del Arenal\"\n\"Cumbia Pa' Tu Madre\"\n\"Proteus\"\n\"Ay David!\"\n\"Los Chucos Suaves\"\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST ARTISTIC TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nGLOBALFEST PRODUCTION TEAM\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThe Andrew W.
