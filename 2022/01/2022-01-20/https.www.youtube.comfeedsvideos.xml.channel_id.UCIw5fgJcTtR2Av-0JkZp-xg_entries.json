Logic Pro X is my DAW of choice. I can compose and arrange DAWless using my hardware equipment only and then transfer the results to Logic for further editing and mixing. Fully in-the-box productions for film scores and soundtrack work are also possible, as Logic hosts my orchestral and other sample libraries from Spitfire Audio, Native Instruments and more.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:51 DAW vs DAWless\n1:19 Hardware/Sequencer Setup\n2:42 MIDI Setup\n3:00 Drum Sounds\n3:13 Synth Mixer\n3:32 Guitar Setup\n3:55 Desk Mixer\n4:46 Desk Setup\n5:32 Studio Monitors\n5:49 Audio Interface\n6:02 Logic + Hardware Workflow\n6:52 Acoustic Treatment\n7:05 Conclusion\n\nEquipment\nDAWless:\n- @1010music Blackbox and Bluebox\n- @iconnectivity MioXM\n- @KorgOfficial M1 plus 1\n- Korg Prologue 8\n- Korg Minilogue\n- Korg MS-20 mini\n- MicroKorg XL+\n- @MoogMusicInc Sub37\n- @teenageengineering OP-1\n- @strymon Bigsky & Mobius\nGuitar:\n- @fender Stratocaster Classic 50s w/ Vintage Noiseless pickups & Obsidianwire electronics\n- @ceriatoneAmp Prince Tut Reverb\n- Ceriatone Horsebreaker\n- @EarthQuakerDevices Plumes\n- @FairfieldCircuitry Shallow Water\n- Keeley Compressor Plus\n- @tcelectronic Flashback 2\n- MXR M196 A/B Box\nDesktop:\n- @ADAMAudioBerlin A5x studio monitors\n- @LGMalaysia Ergo 4K monitor\n- Korg Microkey Air 49\n- Mackie 1402 VLZ4\n- @Audientworld ID14 \n- IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R155 monitor stand", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvql-DYiKc", "date_published": "2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
