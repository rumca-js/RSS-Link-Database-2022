My 6 takeaways from the reveal of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power! We found out the Narrator, the Rating, got a Numenor easter-egg, and of course, the title!  ALSO - we got confirmation from Amazon that HOWARD SHORE is returning to Middle-earth, and it is his music we hear in this teaser!
