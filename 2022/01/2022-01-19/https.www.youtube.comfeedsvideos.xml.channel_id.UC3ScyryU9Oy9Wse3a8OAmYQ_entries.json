Yet millions of Americans either don\u2019t have dental insurance or simply can\u2019t afford to see a dentist. The result? Severe pain, preventable disease, humiliation, bankruptcy and sometimes even death. (Aired 2012)\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Poor children, entitled by law to dental care, often cannot find a dentist willing to see them. Others kids receive excessive care billed to Medicaid, or major surgery for preventable tooth infections. For adults with dental disease, the situation can be just as dire and bankrupting. While millions of Americans use emergency rooms for dental care, corporate dental chains are filling the gaps in care, and in some cases have allegedly overcharged patients or loaded them with high priced credit card debt. \n\nLove FRONTLINE?
