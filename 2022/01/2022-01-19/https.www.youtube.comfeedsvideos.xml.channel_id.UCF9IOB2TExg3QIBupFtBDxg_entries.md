United States, I believe you may be misinterpreting the cause for the multitude of hospitalizations in the US. 

There is an economic incentive, as hospitals are reimbursed for covid patients and not so for other illnesses. 

Co-morbidity? - sure, but the incentive is to hospitalize and pray for covid to be present, or to hospitalize when marginally necessary to rake in the covid bounty.

Mr. Javid

Omicron is in retreat

We have not reached the finish line
Milestone, not an end

But it's not the end of the road and we shouldn't see this as the finish line

because we cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants

Instead we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we have to live with flu

Help keep the virus at bay, isolate if positive

Gat Jabbed

Dr Richard Cree, an intensive care consultant, Middlesbrough

I am confident that the worst will soon be behind us

Far fewer patients are unwell like they were back then (April, 2020) 

The Covid wards are no longer full of people struggling to breathe

The hospital is still finding it a challenge to cope with such a large number of patients

Social care staff shortages, clogged hospitals
