The following biographical information about each performer was written by the globalFEST team.\n\nKombilesa M\u00ed\nBorn from the rich musical and historical heritage of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia (the first free Black town in the Americas), Kombilesa M\u00ed fuses the traditional sounds of the community with urban pop. The band's members experiment with the instruments created by their ancestors (and introduced to them when they were young) by layering them between new sounds.\n\nOver traditional percussion, metal handmade drums of their own design, and mar\u00edmbula, Kombilesa M\u00ed rhymes and raps in Spanish and the traditional Palenquero language, a fusion of African Bantu, Portuguese, French and English. During the performance, you'll hear them call their music \"RFP,\" which means Rap Folkl\u00f3rico Palenquero, a combo of cumbia, son de negro, mapal\u00e9 and son palenquero.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I tando pa palenge\"\n\"I a piy\u00e1 b\u00f3\"\n\"Kumo kusa t\u00e1\"\n\"Los peinados\"\n\"Asina gue\"\n\"Ma Nduse\"\n\"Ata uto beg\u00e1\"\n\nNorthern Cree\nNorthern Cree is a powwow and round dance act, based in Maskwacis, Alberta, Canada. Formed in 1982 by the Wood brothers \u2013 Steve, Randy, Charlie and Earl Wood of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation \u2013 most members originate from the Treaty 6 and are members of the Cree Nation. This year marks Northern Cree's 40th birthday as a group.\n\nNorthern Cree has recorded 50 albums and been nominated for a GRAMMY nine times. They made history in 2017 when they became the first powwow group to perform at the Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. They recorded this performance at the powwow arbor of the Tsuut'ina Nation.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Dream\"\n\"Kohkominaw\"\n\"Storytelling Warrior\"\n\nSon Rompe Pera\nBorn and raised in the deep outskirts of Mexico City, the three Gama brothers are keeping alive the rich legacy of marimba music running through their family. Originally performing alongside their father at local events as kids, they now find themselves at the forefront of the contemporary international cumbia scene with their sonic explorations of the classic marimba.\n\nFrom the Sal\u00f3n Los \u00c1ngeles in Mexico City, this quintet urges listeners to their feet with their unique style of garage-marimba-cumbia rock, played on the historic marimba like no one has ever heard or seen before.\n\nSET LIST\n\"La Tortuga del Arenal\"\n\"Cumbia Pa' Tu Madre\"\n\"Proteus\"\n\"Ay David!\"\n\"Los Chucos Suaves\"\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST ARTISTIC TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nGLOBALFEST PRODUCTION TEAM\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThe Andrew W.

We've tried to maintain the same spirit as the shows at my NPR desk \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just in a different space. The following biographical information about each performer was written by the globalFEST team.\n\nSuistamon S\u00e4hk\u00f6\nPerforming from Tampere, Finland's Suistamon S\u00e4hk\u00f6 whips up rambunctious experimental dance music with a primordial force. Cheerfully moving from ethno-techno to hip-hop, the group's buzzing synthesizers, rap declarations, and a Soviet-made accordion makes audiences come alive.\n\nSuistamon S\u00e4hk\u00f6's third album, 2021's Varokaa! Hengenvaara (loosely translated: \"Beware! Danger to Life\"), is both their most accessible and wildest material to date. It's music engineered (along with their sartorial fabulousness and irresistable dancing) to keep you warm on a frozen Scandinavian winter night.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kalman laulu\"\n\"Kotiin\"\n\"Hummani hei\"\n\nBedouin Burger\nLebanese indie stalwart Zeid Hamdan and celestially voiced Syrian singer Lynn Adib are Bedouin Burger, a rising duo from the Middle East. Their music marries traditional Arab sounds of magam, religious songs of ancient Syria, jazz, and slick pop hooks \u2013 all delivered with a sultry, insouciant flare.\n\nRecording from Helico Studios in France, this rhythmic, entrancing performance exemplifies the band's musical style of \"surviving chaos through a celebration of life.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Mansya\"\n\"Nomad\"\n\"Taht El Ward\"\n\nADG7\nWith one foot in the world of tradition and another in glitzy, upbeat pop, ADG7 (Ak Dan Gwang Chil) is a multi-award winning group inspired by Korea's sacred, shamanic ritual music (gut) and beloved folk songs (minyo) of Hwanghae Province in the northern reaches of the peninsula.\n\nPerforming from Hyehwa, Korea, their powerful performance presents the spiritual blessings and positive energy of traditional music in a thoroughly modern and often comical style. ADG7 was organized in 2015, the year Korea commemorated its 70th anniversary of national liberation, and first performed in-person at globalFEST in January 2020.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Hee Hee\"\n\"Hello, Lonely\"\n\"NOZA NOZA\"\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST ARTISTIC TEAM\n\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nGLOBALFEST PRODUCTION TEAM\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThe Andrew W.
