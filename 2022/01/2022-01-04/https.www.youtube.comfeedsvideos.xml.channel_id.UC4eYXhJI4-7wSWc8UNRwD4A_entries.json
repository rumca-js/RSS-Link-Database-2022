Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLars Gotrich | January 5, 2022\nFrom basements to bandshells, Turnstile shows are a life-affirming mosh-pit ballet. You sweat, you smile, you stage dive, you shake what ya mama gave ya. At the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, Turnstile's high-energy hardcore is converted into seven songs over 17 minutes, surrounded by an art installation by John Scharbach \u2014 those stuffed animals presumably pogoing and windmilling in your imagination.\n\nGLOW ON, one of NPR Music's 50 best albums of 2021, is the rambunctious sum of the band's many parts \u2013 as much Bad Brains as it is Rare Essence and Fania deep cuts \u2013 but with its wild styles fully fused as Turnstile. Filmed at drummer Daniel Fang's house in Baltimore, these songs are all power chords, compact guitar solos, cowbells and fuzz bass, with vocalist Brendan Yates accenting the melody behind the keys. At shows, Yates normally bounces around with joyous aplomb; here, his self-restraint is commendable as he mimes out his stage moves inside an invisible bubble.\n\nIn the back half, Turnstile upsets the sequence: \"MYSTERY\" is transformed into a Fender Rhodes ballad before launching into \"T.L.C. (TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION)\" \u2013 maybe not the first hardcore bruiser to reference Sly and the Family Stone, but certainly one elevated by gang vocals. These songs from GLOW ON, in particular, tug at loneliness and uncertainty, but Turnstile offers a reprieve before we jump back into the pit of life: At the set's close, Yates and Franz Lyons lose the Blood Orange verses from the studio recording of \"ALIEN LOVE CALL\" to meditate on its existential phrase: \"Can't be the only one.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"ENDLESS\"\n\"UNDERWATER BOI\"\n\"BLACKOUT\"\n\"DON'T PLAY\"\n\"MYSTERY\"\n\"T.L.C.
