On top of that Jim Ryan showcases a new game by Guerilla and Firespite called Horizon Call of The Mountain which will be a new VR experience. \n\nHere are more details regarding the PlayStation VR2\n\nBuilding upon our innovations from PS5, PlayStation VR2 adds a true next-gen experience with high-fidelity visuals, new sensory features, and enhanced tracking \u2013 along with a simplified single-cord setup. \n\nVisual Fidelity: For a high-fidelity visual experience, PS VR2 offers 4K HDR, 110-degree field of view, and foveated rendering. With an OLED display, players can expect a display resolution of 2000\u00d72040 per eye and smooth frame rates of 90/120Hz.\n\nHeadset-based Controller Tracking: With inside-out tracking, PS VR2 tracks you and your controller through integrated cameras embedded in the VR headset. Your movements and the direction you look at are reflected in-game without the need for an external camera.\n\nNew Sensory Features: PS VR2 Sense Technology combines eye tracking, headset feedback, 3D Audio, and the innovative PS VR2 Sense controller to create an incredibly deep feeling of immersion. Headset feedback is a new sensory feature that amplifies the sensations of in-game actions from the player. It\u2019s created by a single built-in motor with vibrations that add an intelligent tactile element, bringing players closer to the gameplay experience. For example, gamers can feel a character\u2019s elevated pulse during tense moments, the rush of objects passing close to the character\u2019s head, or the thrust of a vehicle as the character speeds forward. Additionally, PS5\u2019s Tempest 3D AudioTech makes sounds in the player\u2019s surroundings come alive, adding to this new level of immersion.\n\nEye Tracking: With eye tracking, PS VR2 detects the motion of your eyes, so a simple look in a specific direction can create an additional input for the game character. This allows players to interact more intuitively in new and lifelike ways, allowing for a heightened emotional response and enhanced expression that provide a new level of realism in gaming.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:10 Innovation on PlayStation 5\n1:29 New Tournament Feature for PS5\n1:43 PlayStation VR 2 Announcement\n4:12 Horizon Call of the Mountain Trailer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_tCVeS4n-s", "date_published": "2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PlayStation VR2 Sounds Impressive! | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, Naughty Dog teases \"Multiple Game Projects\" in the works, PlayStation VR2 is detailed, Horizon: Call Of The Mountain is announced and Rainbow Six Extraction is announced for Game Pass on day one.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about Naughty Dog\u2019s Neil Druckmann teasing the company is working on multiple game projects while speaking at a Sony CES 2022 briefing.
