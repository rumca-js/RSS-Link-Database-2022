Original omicron, B.1.1.529

https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/

PANGO Lineage is described as a cluster of sequences that are associated with an epidemiological event,

Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGOLIN) 

Omicron includes Pango lineage B.1.1.529 and descendent Pango lineages BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3. 

BA.2 is a descendent lineage

‘Omicron plus’

Identified, Philippines, then to India

Omicron sublineage BA.2

10,000 cases of BA.2, 40 countries

Potentially increased transmissibility over omicron clade BA.1

U.K. Health Security Agency, VUI

Cases doubling every 4 days

120% growth advantage over original Omicron clade

(Delta to Omicron, 500% growth advantage)

Similar growth, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, India

Does not have the same s-gene target failure on PCR as omicron BA.1

BA.2 is S gene positive

BA.1, 60 mutations

BA.2, 80 mutations

no evidence at all yet that it can evade Omicron (BA.1) immunity or be different to Omicron in any meaningful way

Variants will continue to emerge, but not all variants will be a problem

Only having a transmissibility advantage at this stage of the game (with population immunity so high) isn't a total showstopper

Little difference in vaccine effectiveness between BA.1 and BA.2

Disease severity, comparable to BA.1

Unlikely to be another BA.2 omicron wave

Denmark

BA.2 now accounts for 65% of new cases

Early data, not been associated with an increase in hospitalisations

Norway

Increase in BA.2 in Oslo
Concurred that BA.2 is likely more contagious than BA.1.

Question

Can those infected with the BA.1 get re-infected with BA.2.

French Health Minister, Olivier Veran

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/22/omicron-sub-variant-throws-up-new-virus-questions

What we know for now is that BA.2 more or less corresponds to the characteristics that we know of Omicron

Robert Garry, virologist Tulane University School of Medicine

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/24/covid-omicron-ba2/

Variants have come, variants have gone

I don’t think there’s any reason to think this one is a whole lot worse than the current version of omicron

James Musser, Center for Molecular and Translational Human Infectious Diseases Research, Houston Methodist

The good news is we have only three 

We certainly do not see the 5% and more reported in the U.K

Certainly not the 40% in Denmark

We know that omicron … can clearly evade preexisting immunity,

from both vaccines and exposure to other variants of the virus,

What we don’t know yet is whether son-of-omicron does that better or worse than omicron. 

So that’s an open question.

Anders Fomsgaard, virologist, State Serum Institute Denmark

BA. 2 has become the dominant form of the virus in his nation of nearly 6 million people, 

where it now accounts for about 65% of new cases 

as BA. 1 is on the decline

we are not so concerned, since we so far do not see major differences in age distribution, vaccination status, breakthrough infections and risk of hospitalization. 

Also, despite the high infection rate of BA. 2, the numbers in ICUs are decreasing


Francois Balloux, professor of computational biology, University College, London

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/ba2-new-omicron-sub-variant-could-prolong-uk-epidemic-warn-experts/

BA.2 about 20 mutations apart from the original BA.1

the two omicron sub lineages are sister clades that split from other several months ago, and are not derived from each other

People infected with one of the lineages would have “robust immunity” against the other one 

At this stage, BA.1 and BA.2 can be considered as two epidemiologically largely equivalent sub-lineages of omicron

Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission findings, Round 17

REACT-1 study 

Funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in England

65% of the infected said they had already previously tested positive for Covid

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/real-time-assessment-of-community-transmission-findings/

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/R17_final.pdf

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/

Rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has led to the highest ever recorded case incidence levels in many countries around the world. 

RT-PCR test results, self-administered throat and nose swabs

Randomly-selected participants in England, n = 100,607

Ages 5 years and over

Data were collected between 5 and 20 January 2022

Temporal, socio-demographic and geographical spread of the virus

Viral loads and viral genome sequence data for positive swabs. 

Results

Swab positivity was 4.41%

Three-fold higher than in December 2021 in England

1,406 sequenced positive swabs to 16 January 2022

1392 (99.0%) were Omicron

Including 6 (0.43%) cases of BA.2 sub-lineage

14 (1.0%) were Delta

Within round 17

Prevalence was decreasing overall,

but increasing in children aged 5 to 17 years

Swab-positivity prevalence

75 years and older, 2.43%

6+ household, OR 1.66

Urban vs rural areas OR 1.24

Most vs least deprived areas OR 1.33

In adults who received three vs two vaccine doses

Higher Ct values (lower viral load) in rounds 15 and 16
but not in round 17

The distributions of Ct values were similar in unvaccinated and vaccinated children aged 17 years and below in round 15, round 16 and round 17.

Prevalence in those shielding

3.43%

In those not shielding to 4.61%

Conclusions

Unprecedented levels of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in England in January 2022

Almost complete replacement of Delta by Omicron

Vaccination (including the booster campaign) remains the mainstay of the defence

given the high levels of protection against hospitalisations. 

However, further measures beyond vaccination may be required if the very high rates of Omicron infection persist,

Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO, Europe

https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/24/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests

Between vaccination and natural immunity through infection, 

Omicron offers plausible hope for stabilization and normalization

Dr. Tedros

But it’s dangerous to assume that Omicron will be the last variant or that we are in the endgame. 

On the contrary, globally, the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge. 

It’s true that we will be living with Covid for the foreseeable future

a preventable and treatable disease
