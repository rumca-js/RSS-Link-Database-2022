This week, Mary Lucia talks about a documentary originally released in 2010, "Who Is Harry Nilsson (and Why is Everybody Talkin' About Him?)"

"He was a songwriter of epic proportions," Mary says. "He was sort of a misfit and drifted into this career and worked with people who believed in him and his talents.

"It's a really interesting story about a guy who clearly just had an idea to do things the way he wanted to do them," Mary continues. "It's a documentary that's so good, so worth exploring."

"Who Is Harry Nilsson (and Why is Everybody Talkin' About Him?)" is available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu, the Roku Channel, Sling TV and Tubi.
