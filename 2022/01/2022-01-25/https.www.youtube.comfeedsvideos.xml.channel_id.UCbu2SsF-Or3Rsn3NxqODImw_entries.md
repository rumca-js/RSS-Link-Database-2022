In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about Blizzard announcing a new survival game amid the Microsoft acquisition, three new Star Wars games in the works - including a Jedi Fallen Order sequel, and more.

Blizzard has announced it's working on a new survival game for PC and consoles in what looks to be a brand-new universe. Unfortunately, that's about all we know at this point, along with a look at some concept art for the project.

Electronic Arts has announced major plans to create more Star Wars games, with its studios and partners developing three new games, including a sequel to Jedi Fallen Order, an FPS, and a strategy title with Respawn overseeing the development of all three games. However, EA did not announce any new Star Wars Battlefront games.

Lastly, Persia talks about New World's latest update bringing some major changes to the endgame of Amazon's MMORPG, most notably in the form of Expedition Mutators.

From humble beginnings on the GameBoy with Pokemon Red, Blue, and Green, to 3D entries like Pokemon Sword and Shield, we’ve been addicted to catching, battling, breeding, and caring for Pokémon for more than 25 years. With the launch of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, we decided to go back and chart the history of the mainline Pokémon games. 

In this video, we chart the history of the mainline Pokémon games, starting back in the 90s to explore where its creator Satoshi Tajiri got the idea for pocket monsters, to the small team that brought them to life on the GameBoy. The games exploded in popularity because trade between the two versions was required to catch 'em all, and after the trading card game and TV show, Pokémon became the juggernaut we know today. 

With multiple mainline entries, from 2D to 3D titles, spin-offs, mobile games like Pokémon Go, and now the latest game, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, these cute monsters show no sign of slowing down.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a significant reimagining of what makes a Pokémon game, with an exciting level of flexibility that's only slightly hampered by a slow early-game grind.

Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy's PlayStation 5 update enhances the graphics and performance of the games, so in this video we put them side-by-side with the original PlayStation 4 versions. 

The Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection has three modes: Fidelity mode which runs at 4K at 30 frames per second, Performance Mode which runs at 1440p at 60 frames per second, and Performance Plus which runs at 1080p at 120 frame per second. In this video specifically we will be using Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode and comparing the PlayStation 5 and base PlayStation 4.

## Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection Review

Naughty Dog is one of the most recognizable names on PlayStation hardware, and the roaring success of its Uncharted franchise across two generations of the console plays a large part in that legacy. It makes sense then that the studio's first full release for the PlayStation 5 celebrates that storied history, bringing two of the series' best entries to new hardware with a suite of improvements that make experiencing the treasure-hunting adventures a pleasure again. Although some of the underlying design choices are showing some age, the Legacy of Thieves Collection is the best way to play Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: Lost Legacy.
 
Across both games, the most significant changes are clear to see in the game's three modes of play. Fidelity mode targets a native 4K presentation, with the frame rate aiming for a locked 30fps(and sticking there for pretty much every scene). The new performance mode, which is likely the best way to play, reduces the resolution to 1440p but doubles the frame rate to 60fps, which it easily maintains for much more responsive gameplay. A third mode, Performance+, cuts the resolution even more, with a native 1080p presentation and a frame rate that aims for 120fps. You'll need a display that supports that in the first place, and even then, it's a tough concession to make visually for added fluidity that's not really required for the narrative-focused adventures that this collection contains. 
 
What the additional horsepower of the PS5 offers, then, is choice, which wasn't present with the original releases on both the PS4 and PS4 Pro. Both Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy have been playable on PS5 through backwards-compatibility, but have been frustratingly locked to the same 30fps cap as the PS4 versions in both respective campaigns. The higher frame rates for both were reserved for their respective multiplayer modes, which aren't included in this Legacy of Thieves Collection anyway.

The Game Pass catalogue continues to grow new games like Rainbow Six Extraction, and some recent classics like the HITMAN Trilogy. 

There's a lot of games to play on Xbox Game Pass, and with its catalog ever-growing, it can be a lot to keep track of. In this video, we go over some of the recent games to make their way to the service, like Nobody Saves The World, or Rainbow Six Extraction, as well as some hidden gems like Gorogoa, and The Procession To Calvary.

If there weren't already enough games to choose from, Microsoft is bound to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2023, meaning Game Pass is about to get a lot bigger. Once the deal closes, Microsoft will be the home of some of gamings largest franchises like Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Candy Crush.

In an interesting twist, this means Microsoft will be the adoptive parent of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro — two franchises born on PlayStation. It's safe to assume we'll be seeing a lot of Activision Blizzard games showing up on Game Pass in the near future.
