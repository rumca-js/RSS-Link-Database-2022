What if whatever game or simulation you were in allowed you to feel whatever was happening to you? Would you put yourself in pain just to heighten your immersion? \n\nToday I am taking a look at two electrostimulation suits I tried, the hyper advanced and amazing Teslasuit and the newcomer on the block- OWO Skin. Two e-stim devices built to quite literally shock you, allowing your muscles to contract and pain to be felt through electrical pulses in the shirt/ suit. I'm honestly not sure if the world is ready for this, but it's coming anyways- and I'm so excited to see everyone's reactions. \n\nOWO SUIT LINK:\nhttps://owogame.com/\n\nMy links:\n\nDIscord.gg/Thrill\nTwitter.com/Thrilluwu\nTwitch.tv/Thrilluwu", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKeKeCTOfgU", "date_published": "2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
