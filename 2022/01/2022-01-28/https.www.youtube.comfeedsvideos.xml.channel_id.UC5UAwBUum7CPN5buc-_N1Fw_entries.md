When talking about installing Linux, we instantly think about our graphical installers, like the ones that Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Manjaro, PopOS, or elemenary OS provide.
But we forget that there is a step before accessing that graphical installer, and that's creating a bootable media.

While it sounds super easy for most users who have made the switch to Linux, and users who distro hop constantly thanks to Ventoy and the ability to never flash a USB drive again, it's important to remember that most people who use a computer have NEVER created an install disk on their own.


Even if the user manages to make that flash drive, they still have to be able to boot from it. A lot of computers that come with windows preinstalled will only boot to the disk drive first, for security reasons.

Linux desktops also generally offer live sessions, and these are great to try out the distribution and the desktop before installing. I think these live sessions make the install experience much more user friendly, because you're not dropped immediately into something that will mess with your SSD or hard drive, you get a chance to see what it is that you're installing.

Think about it. It's not immediately crystal clear that this session you're running isn't installed on your computer directly, or that the changes you make in this session will be lost when you reboot.

This needs much, much better explanation. Live sessions are fantastic tools, but dropping a user into one without warning or explanation kinda makes them scarier than if they weren't here.

And now we come to the good part, the part where Linux excels compared to the competition: the graphical install part.

Linux desktops, in that regard, are stellar. Our installers are the most user friendly that any user could happen upon. 

The install process is generally extremely simple, if you want to erase your disk or install alongside another OS in a dual boot. You pick the language, the keyboard layout, an install drive, a few options for extra codecs or drivers, and you're good to go.

Installing a Linux desktop takes from 10 to 20 minutes depending on your disk speeds. Windows can take up to an hour with all the reboots and the loading screens.

Linux installers don't pester you with questions and options, and stuff to disable.

The install experience is much more seamless. You get the installation, one reboot, and the user account creation in case of an OEM install. Windows reboots an unhealthy number of times during install, which makes the process jarring.

So, is Linux hard to install? There are 2 ways I can answer that question.

The first one is just taking Linux and Windows on an equal footing, as if someone wanted to install an OS onto a blank computer.

In that case, Linux isn't hard to install. It's easier than Windows: In both cases, you have to download ISO files, create a bootable disk, manage to boot from it, and install, and the Linux install process is much, much easier once you've done these first steps.

The second way I can answer the question is Yes, Linux is hard to install, because while actually installing it is a very easy process, the whole way to access the graphical installer is convoluted, requires a third party tool, and access to the BIOS or UEFI.
