Coffee is my favorite drink. I recently began being able to drink more than one cup of coffee a day without the world starting to spin, but itâ€™s a risky process.

Either way, join me in discovering why coffee is an absolute nightmare. This video discusses the history and geography of coffee, then the growing and processing, then its effect on the body, and finally stuff you can do to make your coffee drinking more ethical. 

I am bad at writing sentences, maybe I need to drink more coffee.. Or less.
