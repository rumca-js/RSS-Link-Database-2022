Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings a bunch of changes to the typical Pokémon formula which means there's a lot to unpack and relearn! If you're just starting out on your new Pokémon adventure and don't know what heavy balls do, how alpha Pokémon work, or the best way to catch 'em all, check out this ultimate beginners guide!


Pokémon: Legends Arceus is not a typical Pokémon game, at least the way we’ve come to understand them. Nintendo’s latest mainline release for the franchise has flipped the formula players may have expected, and the result is a Pokémon game with a lot of new things to learn and discover. This video breaks down several important tips, perfect for the new Pokémon trainer starting their journey. 

First, we dive into battling tips, including the new “Agile” and “Strong” mechanics and how they can be  tactically utilized depending on your goals. For example, if you want to weaken a Pokémon, some Agile moves may let you strike first and throw a Powerball all in the same sequence before your opponent can even attack. 

We also look at different ways players can use the new mechanics in the game, such as riding Pokémon to reach areas previously inaccessible, or by being more aggressive during Noble Pokémon fights without fear of losing save progress or items upon failure. 

There are a lot of subtleties and distinct new changes in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and we’ve got plenty of more cool videos cooking up for all of you soon, so be sure to subscribe to GameSpot and like this video if you found any of these tips helpful. Until next time!

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, DeVante talks about an interesting fact that was confirmed in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, how Elden Ring should be easier to beat, and more. 

Pokemon Legends: Arceus is out now, and a snippet of new Pokemon lore revealed in Arceus has set gaming Reddit ablaze. Supposedly, Pokemon themselves "possess the odd power to shrink themselves down," and that's how they fit into the Poke Balls.

Later in the video, DeVante talks about a Miyazaki interview with PlayStation Blog, where he shared that he believes the barrier of entry has been lowered in Elden Ring due to design choices that now provide additional player agency, and that he hopes “players embrace that idea of receiving help from others,” Miyazaki’s interview also included confirmation that Elden Ring will feature a New Game Plus mode and multiple endings.

The tech-savvy Killjoy, a character in Riot Games' tactical shooter Valorant, was recently shown in a tweet enjoying a piece of NFT art, which raised some eyebrows among more than a few fans. Riot quickly deleted the tweet and has since issued an apology.

February is absolutely stacked for new games releases. In this video, Dave talks about the 9 biggest game releases heading our way this month.

To kick off the first few weeks of the month, Dying Light 2: Stay Human and Lost Ark are sure to keep you busy. Dying Light 2: Stay Human. It’s the direct sequel to 2015’s zombie action parkour game, Dying Light, and like the original game, Dying Light 2 will include 4-player co-op multiplayer. Lost Ark is a Korean Award Winning MMOARPG which was originally released in 2019. It’s finally seeing a Western release this February, and many have been waiting years to be able to play this, as development originally started back in 2011.

Whether you're a strategy game fan or a fighting game fan, there's something for everyone towards the middle of the month. Total War: Warhammer III and King Of Fighters XV both release on the same day and are the next titles in each long-running series. These two huge releases are immediately followed by another with Horizon Forbidden West.

And of course, you can't talk about February releases without talking about Elden Ring. After a short delay, FromSoftware’s latest IP, Elden Ring, is finally releasing and is taking its tried and true weighted 3rd person medieval combat from Dark Souls, and introducing a vast open world to the mix.

The Space Time Distortion is a random event that can occur in the Hisui region at any time and brings with strong Pokémon and valuable items. In this video we have over 8 minutes of catching, dodging, and battling a bunch of different Pokémon while doing our best to keep our team from fainting!

Pokémon: Legends Arceus is out now, and we've got some sick gameplay showing off one of the more interesting parts of the Hisui region: the random and rare Space-Time Distortion mini-event. In this video, we're going to show over 8 minutes of gameplay of us going into these distortion fields and engaging with several powerful Pokémon.

The game has vast open areas where wild Pokémon will roam, but if you linger in a region long enough, a notification will appear that a Space-Time Distortion field is nearby. There's not a lot of information explaining why these fields occur, but if you explore one of them, you'll quickly notice a lot of powerful and, at times, aggressive Pokémon appearing.

The distortion field shows dangerous Pokémon, but there are plenty of rare items on the ground, too, like Nuggets or even evolution items like the Electirizer. You'll also notice two clips: the first is our original experience with the field where we didn't know what to expect. The second half of the video is in the distortion field with a stronger team, which means more successful battles and catches!
