Led by Abellow Yattara, the band is a torch-bearer of quintessentially Tamasheq (or Tuareg) music, shaped by a continuous exchange between the tehardent (lute), vocals and hand percussion. The words sung are similarly percussive, like an instrument themselves. This genre of music has been performed for half a millennium by Tuareg griots to celebrate the end of harvest and the changing seasons, heroic warriors and noble families. --The globalFEST staff\n\nSET LIST\n\"Apolo\"\n\"Djaba\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAbellaw Yattara: lead tehardent, vocals\nAboubacrine Yattara: bass tehardent\nMohamed Abellaw: tehardent, vocals\nIbrahim \"Tchiale\" Ag Aboubacrine: calabash\nHamadoun Guindo: calabash\n\nCREDITS\nProduction: Christopher Nolan \u2014 Clermont Music\nAudio: Yaya Diarra \u2014 Tadiazt\nAudio Mastering: Dave Cook \u2014 Area 52 Studios\nDirection: Mahadi \"Kiss\" Diouara \u2014 Millenium Communications\nSpecial thanks: Abdallah Ag Amano \u2014 Tadiazt\n\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTiny Desk Team\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mixing: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nglobalFEST Artistic Team\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin\n2022 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, Gabrielle Davenport\n\nglobalFEST Production Team\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film*\nVideo Producer: Karim Tabbaa\n\nSpecial Thanks\nThe Andrew W.
