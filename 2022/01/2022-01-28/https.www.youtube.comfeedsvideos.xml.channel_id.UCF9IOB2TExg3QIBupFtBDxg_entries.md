But who 'fact checks' the 'fact checkers'

Covid: Posts claiming only 17,000 died of virus 'factually incorrect'

Then on 20 January, Dr John Campbell, a retired nurse educator who has amassed a huge following on YouTube, released a video describing the figures as a "huge story" and suggested Covid deaths were "much lower than mainstream media seems to have been intimating".

"It has become a weapon of the cruel and heartless to dismiss the deaths of the people we love."

The BBC has contacted Mr Nawaz, Dr Campbell and Mr Davis.

Information based on scientific facts is a human right

Pope Francis

To be properly informed, to be helped to understand situations based on scientific data and not fake news, is a human right

Journalists and scientists, should try to build bridges to those who need to hear scientific truths

lauded those who could properly place individual facts in a broader picture

by explaining the causes and circumstances of a given situation.

10 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally

Professor Madhukar Pai, epidemiology and biostatistics, McGill University in Montreal

South Africa, for example, has set up a hub to begin developing mRNA vaccines where scientists, are trying to reverse-engineer the Moderna vaccine from scratch, because the U.S. drugmaker won’t share its technology.

Dr. Pai likened this to reinventing the wheel while a car is on fire.

## Data, we want it all, and we want it now

Today

Despite the global rollout of covid-19 vaccines and treatments, 

the anonymised participant level data underlying the trials for these new products remain inaccessible to doctors, researchers, and the public

This is morally indefensible for all trials, but especially for those involving major public health interventions.

Pfizer’s pivotal covid vaccine trial, designed, run, analysed, and authored by Pfizer employees. 

The company and the contract research organisations that carried out the trial hold all the data.

Pfizer has indicated that it will not begin entertaining requests for trial data until May 2025, (NCT04368728).

Moderna data

may be available … with publication of the final study results in 2022

Datasets will be available upon request and subject to review once the trial is complete

Eestimated primary completion date 27 October 2022 (NCT04470427).



AstraZeneca

As of 31 December 2021 

timelines vary per request and can take up to a year upon full submission of the request

Regeneron’s phase III trial of monoclonal antibody therapy REGEN-COV

Participant level data will not be made available to others EMU)

Should the drug be approved, sharing will be considered

Remdesivir

US National Institutes of Health, (funders) The longitudinal data set only contains a small subset of the protocol and statistical analysis plan objectives

In our view, there is no dilemma
the anonymised individual participant data from clinical trials must be made available for independent scrutiny.
US Food and Drug Administration, freedom of information request to the agency for Pfizer’s vaccine data

UK, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency

does not proactively release clinical trial documents

Transparency and trust

Transparent decision making is essential. 

At least three of the many companies making covid-19 vaccines have past criminal and civil settlements costing them billions of dollars

The BMJ supports vaccination policies based on sound evidence. 

The same applies to treatments for covid-19 

Data must be available when trial results are announced, published, or used to justify regulatory decisions. 

There is no place for wholesale exemptions from good practice during a pandemic. 

The public

Has paid for covid-19 vaccines through vast public funding of research

that takes on the balance of benefits and harms

has a right and entitlement to those data, as well as to the interrogation of those data by experts.

Pharmaceutical companies are reaping vast profits without adequate independent scrutiny of their scientific claims.

The purpose of regulators is not to dance to the tune of rich global corporations and enrich them further; 

it is to protect the health of their populations. 

We need complete data transparency for all studies, we need it in the public interest, and we need it now.
