4 cohorts

Unvaccinated, no previous diagnosis

Vaccinated, no previous diagnosis

Unvaccinated with previous diagnosis

Vaccinated with previous diagnosis

So, what happened to these people during delta?

By November 30, 2021, California and New York

Natural immunity without vaccination protected against delta admission

Subsequent vaccination boosts antibodies

Results, highest to lowers risk

Unvaccinated, no previous diagnosis

Vaccinated, no previous diagnosis

Equally low risk

Unvaccinated with previous diagnosis

Vaccinated with previous diagnosis

Data validity

Unvaccinated with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis

18.0% of California residents

18.4% of New York residents 

Conclusion

Natural immunity with or without vaccine provided robust protection against hospitalization in the age of delta

The people that died had no risk of reinfection

This data is about those who survived infection

Questions

If I have not been vaccinated or infected, should I seek out natural exposure?

Would some higher risk groups still benefit from subsequent vaccination?

Is there still an advantage in younger people getting boosted if they have had infection?

Is there still an advantage in younger people getting boosted if they have not had infection?

Do we need to change the one size fits all recommendations?

Should there be modified vaccination recommendations for those who have been infected?

Is it worth getting antibodies to membrane, envelope, nucleocapsid proteins?

How with this wild type and alpha induced immunity, protecting against delta work in the age of omicron?
