In This episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the new legend and game mode coming to Apex Legends season 12, Elden Ring goes gold while Dark Souls servers are shut down due to hackers, and more.

Video Notes: In the most recent “Stories From The Outlands”, it is confirmed that Mad Maggie will be the next playable legend in Apex Legends season 12. There will also be a new 9v9 game mode with infinite respawns where you control points to win similar to Titanfall’s Hardpoint. More is said to come in the next season titled Defiance.

From Software has completed development on the long-awaited Elden Ring but the work isn't completely done as the developers are now working on a day one patch that will include updates and optimizations. This news arrives along with an exploit that caused the company to temporarily take down all Dark Souls PvP servers on PC while under investigation.

Lastly, Persia talks about the newest crossover between Dead By Daylight and the horror movie series, Saw.

With Pokémon Legends: Arceus right around the corner on January 28th, here's everything you need to know about the brand new adventure in the Hisui Region.

Pokemon has had plenty of fun stories and interesting tidbits throughout its lifetime. The historic franchise has been going strong for over 25 years. With that longevity comes iconic glitches, bugs, and playground stories of secret Pokemon embedded in-game codes. We break down a small handful of things that you may not know about Pokemon in this video.

The stories range wildly, from the fact that Nintendo had no idea Mew even existed to late president Satoru Iwata being an absolute legend with his assistance on compressing data in Gold and Silver. There are dozens of Easter eggs and fun trivia-style facts about Pokemon.

Pokemon Legends: Arceus will be the latest entry in the Pokemon franchise and arguably one of the most anticipated games in 2022. Be sure to check out our coverage and upcoming guides, breakdowns, and previews by subscribing to our GameSpot YouTube channel!

The Game Pass catalogue continues to grow new games like Rainbow Six Extraction, and some recent classics like the HITMAN Trilogy. 

There's a lot of games to play on Xbox Game Pass, and with its catalog ever-growing, it can be a lot to keep track of. In this video, we go over some of the recent games to make their way to the service, like Nobody Saves The World, or Rainbow Six Extraction, as well as some hidden gems like Gorogoa, and The Procession To Calvary.

If there weren't already enough games to choose from, Microsoft is bound to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2023, meaning Game Pass is about to get a lot bigger. Once the deal closes, Microsoft will be the home of some of gamings largest franchises like Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Candy Crush.

In an interesting twist, this means Microsoft will be the adoptive parent of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro — two franchises born on PlayStation. It's safe to assume we'll be seeing a lot of Activision Blizzard games showing up on Game Pass in the near future.
