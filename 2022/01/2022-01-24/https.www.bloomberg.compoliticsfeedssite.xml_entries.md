Croatia, the European Union’s newest member, adopts the euro as its currency on Jan. 1. The move vaults the nation of around 4 million people into the EU’s core, making payments easier and cheaper and giving its financial system a safety net in future crises. The country, whose economy is highly dependent on foreign tourists, also joins the Schengen zone, allowing Croatians to travel more easily around Europe.
