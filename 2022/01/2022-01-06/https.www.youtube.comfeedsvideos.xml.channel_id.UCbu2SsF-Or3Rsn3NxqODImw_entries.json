One stand out note is that the maps are substantially larger than their Rainbow Six Siege predecessors but they are way more horizontal compared to those found in Siege, where verticality plays a larger role in both map design and navigation. This is only based on the two maps listed above.\u00a0\n\nIn Extraction, several of Rainbow's operators are recruited to join a special team tasked with combating the parasitic alien Archaeon threat that's spread throughout North America. That mission takes you to four different zones, each of which are divided into three maps, and each of those maps in turn are cut into three separate regions. So, for example, the San Francisco zone is split into the Tenderloin, Enterprise Space Foundation, and Apollo Casino & Resort maps.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65p4-n68qB0", "date_published": "2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Minecraft Froglight Blocks Are Coming! | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot news, we talk about Minecraft adding Froglights blocks, Jedi: Fallen Order sequel reportedly being announced this year, and new details on rumored the Last of Us PS5 remake.\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about Minecraft\u2019s beta update that introduces Froglight blocks to the game.
