"Omicron, South Africa on November 24th, 2021\n\nOmicron diverged from the B.1.1 lineage roughly in mid-2020\n\nMutations not found in:\n\nAlpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants isolated from three chronically infected patients\n\nThe B.1.1 variants showed the highest sequence similarities to Omicron\n\nNormal rate of mutations in spike protein RNA\n\n\u223c0.45 mutations per month\n\nDuring missing time for Omicron\n\n27 mutations accumulated in spike protein RNA (in Branch O) during 18 months\n\n\u223c1.5 mutations per month\n\n \u223c3.3 times faster than the average rate of other variants\n\nFirst hypothesis\n\nOmicron could have \u201ccryptically spread\u201d and circulated in a population\n\nSecond hypothesis\n\nOmicron could have evolved in a chronically infected COVID-19 patient\n\nThird hypothesis\n\nOmicron could have accumulated mutations in a nonhuman host and then jumped into humans \n\n\n\n\nMice\n\nEvidence for a mouse origin of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1673852721003738\n\nThe rapid accumulation of mutations Omicron\n\nProximal origin occurred in humans or another mammalian host?\n\nOmicron, 45 point mutations that Omicron acquired since divergence from the B.1.1 lineage\n\n\n\nSignificantly different from the spectrum for viruses that evolved in human patients\n\nOmicron spike protein sequence, stronger positive selection than that of any previous variants\n\nSuggesting a possibility of host-jumping\n\nResembled the spectra associated with virus evolution in a mouse cellular environment\n\nMutations in the Omicron spike protein significantly overlapped with SARS-CoV-2 mutations known to promote adaptation to mouse hosts\n\n(through enhanced spike protein binding affinity for the mouse cell entry receptor)\n\n\nSo\n\nOmicron jumped from humans to mice,\n\nrapidly accumulated mutations conducive to infecting that host, \n\nthen jumped back into humans, \n\nindicating an inter-species evolutionary trajectory for the Omicron outbreak\n\nFortunately\n\nEvolved to increase binging to mouse ACE2 receptors\n\nConsistent with human immune
