The M1 Garand has made a huge impact in the real world, and in the world of our pop culture, movies and games, and is famous for making a ringing PING sound when fired until empty. But where does this sound come from, and how does it factor into the M1 Garand’s revolutionary design? 

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the mechanical and design idiosyncrasies of one of WW2’s most iconic weapons, the M1 Garand.

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about how the next Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare might arrive earlier than expected, GTA Online adding a brand new multiplayer mode, and more. 

Video Notes:
The next game in the Call Of Duty franchise for 2022 might be coming sooner than we think due to the low sales of Vanguard according to Tom Henderson who has leaked accurate information in the past for previous Call Of Duty titles, Battlefield 2042, and more.

Rockstar Games has announced a new multiplayer mode for GTA Online called Double Down. In Double Down, you play as Franklin or Lamar in a co-op experience where you face a "brutal onslaught" of enemies.

Lastly, Persia talks about Ubisoft’s newest partnership with Pathe to create a "location-based VR escape game" inspired by the upcoming movie "Notre-Dame on Fire" from director Jean-Jacques Annaud.
