In this video, Dave talks about the 9 biggest game releases heading our way this month.\n\nTo kick off the first few weeks of the month, Dying Light 2: Stay Human and Lost Ark are sure to keep you busy. Dying Light 2: Stay Human. It\u2019s the direct sequel to 2015\u2019s zombie action parkour game, Dying Light, and like the original game, Dying Light 2 will include 4-player co-op multiplayer. Lost Ark is a Korean Award Winning MMOARPG which was originally released in 2019. It\u2019s finally seeing a Western release this February, and many have been waiting years to be able to play this, as development originally started back in 2011.\n\nWhether you're a strategy game fan or a fighting game fan, there's something for everyone towards the middle of the month. Total War: Warhammer III and King Of Fighters XV both release on the same day and are the next titles in each long-running series. These two huge releases are immediately followed by another with Horizon Forbidden West.\n\nAnd of course, you can't talk about February releases without talking about Elden Ring. After a short delay, FromSoftware\u2019s latest IP, Elden Ring, is finally releasing and is taking its tried and true weighted 3rd person medieval combat from Dark Souls, and introducing a vast open world to the mix.\n\nFor more information on release dates, news, and updates of all our games in the list, please visit gamespot.com!\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nDying Light 2 - 00:10\nLost Ark - 01:14\nKOF XV - 02:18\nTotal War: Warhammer III - 03:37\nHorizon Forbidden West - 04:37\nDestiny 2: The Witch Queen - 05:56\nGrid Legends - 06:58\nElden Ring - 08:18\nSteam Deck - 09:51\nOutro - 10:29", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSmXf6eKo8U", "date_published": "2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
