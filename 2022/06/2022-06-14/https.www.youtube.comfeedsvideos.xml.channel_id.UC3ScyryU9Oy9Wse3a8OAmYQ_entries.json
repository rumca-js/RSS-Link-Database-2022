Through interviews with school executives, government officials, admissions counselors, former students, and industry observers, the documentary explores the tension between the industry \u2014 which says it's helping an underserved student population obtain a quality education and marketable job skills \u2014 and critics who charge the for-profits with churning out worthless degrees that leave students with a mountain of debt. At the center of it all stands a vulnerable population of potential students, often working adults eager for a university degree to move up the career ladder. \n\nLove FRONTLINE?
