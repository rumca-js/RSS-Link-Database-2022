UC2628\n\nVisit the BUDK store to check out their LOTR replicas: https://bit.ly/37IM8aj\n\nOfficial Description:\nThe dwarven kind carried many axes, but none as powerful as the Bearded Axe of Gimli. This replica piece stretches a massive 34\" and supports an 8\" axe blade. This authentically detailed axe is a reproduction of the prop featured in The Lord of the Rings - \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" - presented by New Line Cinema. United Cutlery, the industry leader in fine film prop reproductions, has meticulously recreated the actual filming prop. The blade is cast of a stainless steel and features gold engravings and a weathered steel finish giving it a battle-worn appearance. The replica was created using the finest grade materials and craftsmanship available. Close attention to quality is a priority in every hand-selected piece. Each replica is laser engraved with the appropriate copyrights to ensure authenticity. Includes display plaque.\n\nWhile this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)\n\n#lordoftherings #unboxing #lotr", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUYgFgdVxfs", "date_published": "2022-06-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
