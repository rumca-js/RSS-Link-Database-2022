#GamingNews #PS5 #fallout5 

According to a new report, Sony is releasing a PlayStation 5 pro controller with removable analog sticks and rear paddle triggers, similar to the Xbox Elite controller. The report also claims Sony will reveal new hardware--but not a new console--at the end of June, though it's unclear if this rumored new controller may be part of that. 

Bethesda's Todd Howard has confirmed that the studio plans to work on Fallout 5 following the completion of The Elder Scrolls VI. During a new interview Howard spoke about what the studio has planned after Starfield, and he touched on the progress of The Elder Scrolls VI by stating that the project was still in pre-production.

Fan favorite character Casey Jones was recently revealed as a playable character in the most recent DotEmu beat 'em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and we have the first 11 minutes of gameplay for you to check out!

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are no strangers to being put into great arcade beat 'em ups and the latest one from DotEmu is no exception. This time not only are Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Rafael all coming back but they brought some friends with them as well! Aside from the turtles players can finally play as their wise teacher and father figure Master Splinter, their best friend and occasional pizza supplier April O'Niel, and also fan favorite Casey Jones who brings his all of his favorite, even iconic sports equipment along with him to keep back any villains who are unfortunate enough to find themselves on the business end of his hockey stick. All of these characters return with classing moves and throws and even have some new ones to make sure the beat downs stay fresh.

Casey Jones himself is a character you can't use at the beginning of the game. To unlock Casey Jones you have to finish story mode once, which shouldn't be too difficult of a task. Once you lay the smack down on the last boss you'll get a notification that you have unlocked the hockey mask wearing hero to play in all of the games modes!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is available on June 16th, 2022 on Windows, Steam, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

Modern Warfare 2’s beta could take place in August, Diablo 4’s game director explains why there are no new classes, and Starfield reveals the protagonist is silent.

#GamingNews #MW2 #Starfield

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting a beta, and according to an Amazon product page, it could be coming in August. The page for MW2 on PS5 says players who preorder will receive their beta code in August. The Xbox Series X|S page gets a little more specific and says those who preorder by August 15 will unlock early access to the open beta.

Last week Diablo 4 game director Joe Shely revealed why the game doesn’t have any brand new classes. According to Shely, the decision came down to player expectations and making sure that aspects fans remember from previous Diablo games are present in Diablo IV, albeit in a new, modern form.

Bethesda confirmed that you'll be a silent protagonist on its official Twitter account. Fan reaction seems split. Some have expressed disappointment in the silent protagonist trope, saying it breaks immersion. Others say they prefer silence, as opposed to hearing a performance of a line you just read.
