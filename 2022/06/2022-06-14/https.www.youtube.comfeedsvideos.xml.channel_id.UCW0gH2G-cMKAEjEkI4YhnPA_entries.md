Official Description:
The dwarven kind carried many axes, but none as powerful as the Bearded Axe of Gimli. This replica piece stretches a massive 34" and supports an 8" axe blade. This authentically detailed axe is a reproduction of the prop featured in The Lord of the Rings - "The Fellowship of the Ring" - presented by New Line Cinema. United Cutlery, the industry leader in fine film prop reproductions, has meticulously recreated the actual filming prop. The blade is cast of a stainless steel and features gold engravings and a weathered steel finish giving it a battle-worn appearance. The replica was created using the finest grade materials and craftsmanship available. Close attention to quality is a priority in every hand-selected piece. Each replica is laser engraved with the appropriate copyrights to ensure authenticity. Includes display plaque.

While this was sent to me by a vendor, I was under no obligation to give this item a positive review.  Any praise/criticism in my reviews is my genuine opinion/thoughts.  If you are surprised that I really enjoy a LOTR piece of memorabilia, you really shouldn't be. :)
