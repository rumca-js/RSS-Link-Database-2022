UK, 5 million age 5 to 11

Children aged 5 to 11 years will be offered 2 doses of the coronavirus vaccine.

JCVI advises a non-urgent offer of two 10 mcg doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®) to children aged 5 to 11 years of age who are not in a clinical risk group.

anti-N antibodies

As of February 2022, approximately 75% of children and adolescents had serologic evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, with approximately one third becoming newly seropositive since December 2021.

These findings illustrate a high infection rate for the Omicron variant, especially among children

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at or above 179 nanograms per millilitre (ng/ml), UK, 29 November 2021 to 15 May 2022

Testing negative means that an individual did not have enough antibodies to be detected in the test, not that they do not have any immune protection against the virus.

Pfizer booster dose, the evidence

Data from a subanalysis of 30 sera

clinical trial of children 5 through 11 years

36-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron neutralizing titers following a booster (third) dose

Phase 2/3 clinical trial with 140 children

a booster (third) dose increased neutralizing antibodies by 6-fold against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain

Natural immunity

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm

CDC data from New York and California demonstrated that natural immunity was 2.8 times more effective in preventing hospitalization 

3.3 to 4.7 times more effective in preventing COVID infection compared to vaccination during the Delta wave.
