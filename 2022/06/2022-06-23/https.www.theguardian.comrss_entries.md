The RMT, which was also involved in the Merseyrail negotiations said it plans to put the offer to its members.<br /><br />The RMT’s general secretary Mick Lynch said the deal was an example of what can be achieved when ministers are not involved.<br /><br />Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “The importance of that is the DFT (Department for Transport) and the Treasury are not pulling the strings in that negotiation.”<br /><br />He added: “That’s also the situation in other companies such as Transport for Wales, which is outside the DFTs control and Scotrail where we’re going to get proposals on pay which are far superior to what [Transport Secretary] Grant Shapps will allow to happen.”<br /><br />“Where Grant Shapps has no influence on this railway we are getting deals and getting offers that are likely to be more progressive than the ones we’re getting from Westminster.”<br /><br />Lynch added: “We need a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and when we get that we can move on positively to the other agenda items, which includes<br />changes to working practices, and the adoption of new technology.”<br /><br />“It is the government in the form of Grant Shapps and the Treasury that are stopping those ideas coming forward. If we were dealing with the companies of their own volition ... I think we would have had a deal on these issues quite a long time ago.”<br /><br />Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today Eddie Dempsey, Assistant General Secretary of the RMT, said: “Wherever we’re dealing with somebody who’s not directly controlled by the DFT, we’re making progress: London Underground 8.5%; Docklands Light Railway we’ve got an inflation busting deal; Crossrail, saame thing, Transport for Wales we’re in the business of negotiating something there now. Mercy rail 7.1%.”<br /><br />But Tim Shoveller, Network Rail’s chief negotiator, suggested it would be too expensive to offer a 7.1% pay increase to settle the national dispute.<br /><br />Speaking to the Today programme ahead of further talks today, Shoveller said: “We currently have an offer that totals 3% on the table and we’re keen to improve on that. But that’s subject to affordability.<br /><br />“The difference between the 3% on the table now and a 7.1% is £65m every year just for the groups that are on strike today.”<br /></p><p><em> I think every Labour MP should come out. Let’s have it right, the Labour party was born out of the trade union movement and they are our political voice in parliament so every Labour MP should be out.</em></p><p><em> We don’t want to mess up people’s travel arrangements but if you’re pushed into a corner you have got to do something.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2022/jun/23/train-strikes-railways-rail-disruption-britain-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Got something you’d like to ask the Mission: Impossible and Deep Impact actor? Send it our way and we’ll put it to him</p><p>There’s aren’t many actors who can put “hand picked by Tom Cruise” on their CV. Scottish actor Dougray Scott was personally cast by TC to play rogue Impossible Missions Force agent and chief bad guy in 2000’s Mission: Impossible II – famous for that Cruise/Scott motorbike fighting scene. It’s a role that propelled the Twin Town and Deep Impact actor to international fame, even if it did mean he lost the role of Wolverine for 2000’s X-Men (to Hugh Jackman) after filming on MI2 overran. Scott was also apparently in the running to take over Bond in 2006’s Casino Royale, but was pipped to the post by Daniel Craig.</p><p>But let’s not worry about all that. This is a safe, happy space where we can quiz the Scot on working with John Malkovich in 2002’s Ripley’s Game; Emilia Fox and Billie Piper in 2005 British caper Things to Do Before You’re 30; and Liam Neeson in 2014’s Taken 3. On the small screen, he has appeared in everything from Taggart and Batwoman to Desperate Housewives and the 2009 BBC adaptation of The Day of the Triffids, and played everyone from Moses to Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/23/post-your-questions-for-dougray-scott">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and campaigner came to Britain from Trinidad and Tobago in 1954 and rose to join Laurence Olivier’s National Theatre company. Clint Dyer and others explain why we should remember her</p><p>Pearl Prescod’s star soared high in her day. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, she became the first Black actor to play with the National Theatre company, under Laurence Olivier, in London in 1965. She appeared in the West End and on television, recorded radio plays, worked on the cabaret circuit and was also a prominent activist alongside Claudia Jones and Amy Ashwood Garvey. So why isn’t Prescod better known today?</p><p>Partly because her career was cut short by an untimely death – she had a brain haemorrhage at the age of 46, just a year after her breakthrough National Theatre role. But those excavating her forgotten legacy today think there is more to it than that. Coming to Britain in 1954, aged 34, on a music scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she was part of a larger group of well-educated, highly politicised Caribbean figures who arrived in the postwar era to make similarly impressive strides in culture and in consciousness-raising around race but whose names have since been forgotten.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/23/theatre-star-pearl-prescod">Continue reading...</a>

## The Playbook by Jennifer Jacquet review – how big business takes on science and wins

<p>A ‘guide’ for companies looking to counter unwelcome research exposes the corporate world’s dark arts</p><p>“Playbook” is a term that feels overused at the moment – mostly because of Vladimir Putin’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance" title="">military adventures</a>. We now know all too well that his playbook, deployed in Chechnya, then Syria, and now Ukraine, involves heavy bombardment of civilian areas with the aim of demoralising and grinding down a population towards eventual defeat. The end goal is the demonstration of Putin’s ruthlessness – one of his key tools for retaining power. Jennifer Jacquet’s The Playbook is about something else entirely – the methods corporations use to “deny science, sell lies, and make a killing”. The specifics couldn’t be more different. And yet, in some fundamental and peculiar ways, the strategies are similar.</p><p>Jacquet chooses a slightly unusual means of getting her ideas across, writing in the style of a helpful guide for corporations faced with scientific evidence that could “pose a risk to business operations”. Readers might assume the odd business may have used some of these dubious methods to push back against unwelcome research every so often, but they probably wouldn’t think it was a systemic issue. It doesn’t take long, however, to realise that Jacquet has a point – that the use of these tactics really does amount to a playbook to which almost every sector has had recourse at some point. The sheer weight of evidence that she piles up, chapter by chapter, is unarguable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/23/the-playbook-by-jennifer-jacquet-review-how-big-business-takes-on-science-and-wins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the months since the invasion of Ukraine, Estonians, who share a border with Russia, are increasingly concerned about potential Kremlin aggression. Despite the threat being low, more than 1,000 ordinary women have volunteered to join the Women's Defence Organisation since the conflict began. Car mechanic Mari Klandorf is one. She now spends her weekends training in first aid, guerrilla warfare and firearms and says: 'Russia might not be coming tomorrow, or the next day, but I want to be prepared.'

<p>It’s vital to avoid a false choice between peace and justice: that only helps the Kremlin. We need terms both sides might accept</p><p>We are setting up an entirely false choice over Ukraine that, if pursued, could unnecessarily undermine European unity. Last week a <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine/">poll</a> for the European Council on Foreign Relations showed two camps in European public opinion emerging: a larger peace camp (35%) that wants to cut and run now, and a smaller justice camp (25%) that wants to push ahead until victory. In fact, if you look at the detail, there are three groups, with the biggest single group (43%) choosing both peace and justice.</p><p>This divide between peace and justice is reflected in public polemic, too. At one extreme there is Henry Kissinger, <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956946/is-henry-kissinger-right-about-ukraine">arguing at Davos</a> that Ukraine should concede territory now to secure a ceasefire and warning us to avoid humiliating Vladimir Putin. Not surprisingly, this provoked a sharp reaction from those who correctly point out that Putin shows no sign of being ready to negotiate seriously or respond to concessions. More likely, a pre-emptive cringe would not only fail to secure a lasting peace, but would also leave Putin in a position to return and grab more of Ukraine once he regroups his forces.</p><p>Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair’s chief negotiator on Northern Ireland while chief of staff to the prime minister, 1997-2007, and is the chief executive and founder of Inter Mediate, a charity devoted to helping end armed conflicts</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/23/putin-not-ready-end-ukraine-war-prepared">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Grammy-nominated UK singer on her journey from guesting on dance bangers to starring in Baz Lurhmann’s Elvis, and her long battle for recognition in the white, male-dominated Americana scene</p><p>When the rumours started that Baz Luhrmann was snooping around Nashville for someone to play Sister Rosetta Tharpe in his Elvis biopic, Yolanda Quartey knew she had to step up. The country-soul singer, known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/21/yola-from-down-and-out-in-london-to-nashvilles-country-soul-star" title="">Yola</a>, is British but is based in the heartland of US roots music. She’d grown up listening to Tharpe back in Bristol and strongly related to her story.</p><p>Until recently, Tharpe’s contribution to laying the foundations for rock’n’roll in the 1930s and 40s – with her gutsy gospel singing and claw-hammer-plucked electric guitar, a huge influence on the Memphis Flash himself – had gone largely unsung in popular culture. Quartey has experienced that erasure first hand, too.

## The House of Fortune by Jessie Burton review – a sequel to The Miniaturist

<p>This thoughtful follow-up is a clever echo of Burton’s debut, tracing a woman’s coming of age in early 18th-century Amsterdam</p><p>When we rejoin Nella Oortman, the heroine of Jessie Burton’s blockbuster 2014 debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/10/miniaturist-jessie-burton-review-history-modern-day-heroine">The Miniaturist</a>, we find her almost as we left her. She still lives in her dead husband Johannes Brandt’s home on the Herengracht canal in Amsterdam, along with Cornelia the cook, Johannes’s once-enslaved manservant Otto, and Thea, the child Otto fathered with Johannes’s steely sister, Marin. So far so familiar, but 18 years have passed: Nella is now 37 and baby Thea a young woman. The three unrelated adults have bonded into a family after the deaths of Marin and Johannes, but their fortunes are dwindling and the once lavish house has been stripped bare.</p><p>The family is a curiosity – “the black man who lives on the Herengracht, his mixed daughter, and the widow of the man drowned by the city for his supposed sins” – and Thea’s status as a Black heiress is troubling to the upper-class Amsterdammers she mingles with, who must weigh her “whiff of scandal” against her stratospherically expensive and fashionable home. Nella is keen to solve the family’s money problems by arranging her a lucrative marriage, but Thea resists. Just as her aunt once did, Thea believes in true love. Unlike Nella, she believes she’s found it, in the arms of a handsome theatre set decorator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/23/the-house-of-fortune-by-jessie-burton-review-a-sequel-to-the-miniaturist">Continue reading...</a>

## NHS sent my wife a penalty notice for getting a prescription

<p>Unknown to her, her prepay certificate had been returned as ‘incorrect address’ and been cancelled</p><p><strong>My wife has a direct debit for an NHS prescription prepay certificate, which auto-renews every year. Recently, she received a penalty charge notice (PCN) for a prescription she collected three months ago. It appears that last year her new certificate was returned as undelivered to the issuer, NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA), because of an “incorrect address”, even though we haven’t moved. NHSBSA therefore cancelled the direct debit and the auto-renewal. We were unaware of this, and my wife continued to tick the prepaid box when she collected her prescriptions. NHSBSA claims it did not notify us because it assumed we’d moved. It has since issued the certificate, but says it can’t backdate it and insists my wife pay the PCN. We’re happy to make up the payments missed after the direct debit was cancelled, but I am concerned it may issue a PCN for all of the prescriptions she received during that period. She is on weekly prescriptions for eight medications.<br /></strong><em><strong>EA, Hastings</strong></em></p><p>NHSBSA tells me it was unable to comment on your wife’s case due to confidentiality, but says that if a pre-payment certificate is returned as undeliverable, it cancels payments so patients are not left out of pocket for a service they can’t use. It confirmed that patients are alerted if they have provided an alternative contact. You say your wife was called soon after I intervened and told that, since a phone number was included in her records, she should have been informed as soon as the certificate was returned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/23/nhs-sent-my-wife-a-penalty-notice-for-getting-a-prescription">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fans of movie explosions get another chance to spend time with the character that inspired Ronald Reagan</p><p>Forty years on, here’s a rerelease of the first movie in the Rambo series from 1982: the watchable if entirely preposterous exploitation-action picture in which star and co-writer Sylvester Stallone makes his first appearance as John Rambo, the decorated Green Beret, Vietnam veteran and commando übermensch in a permanent rage at the way he and his fellow soldiers were let down. It climaxes with an entirely bizarre speech from Rambo on the subject of his PTSD, delivered in Stallone’s unintelligible slurred drone: “Igghh sawfff bodyghhh partghhs everyghrhwhere…!”</p><p>This was actually the film that came before the one that made Rambo a real movie icon, Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), where he has to go back to Vietnam for a fantasy replay of the war on the grounds that he is searching for urban-mythic “MIA POWs”. That was the movie that Ronald Reagan watched in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_847">1985 Beirut hostage crisis</a> and famously said: “Boy, after seeing Rambo last night, I know what to do next time this happens.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/23/rambo-first-blood-review-rerelease-sylvester-stallone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Researchers say the return of wolves to Yellowstone in the 1990s kickstarted big changes in habitats. But that narrative is increasingly being challenged</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/wild-world">Read more in our Wild world series</a></li></ul><p>In 1995, in Yellowstone national park, eight wolves were released from a white truck that had travelled 700 miles from Alberta, Canada. They were the first to live in the park for 70 years and the most fabled predator’s return to the world’s most famous national park inspired research that would feature in ecology textbooks for decades.</p><p>A key narrative from this event is that wolves created a “landscape of fear” in the park, which kickstarted big changes in habitats, known as trophic cascades. It is an argument used to justify releasing wolves elsewhere. But increasingly, researchers are looking at the nuances of what happened in the decades after wolves were introduced and challenging this approach. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/23/rebalancing-act-bringing-back-wolf-fix-broken-ecosystem-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

## Heatwaves pushing up demand for air conditioning in UK

Much of that electricity comes from power stations that emit greenhouse gases and, to make matters worse, air conditioners can also leak <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fluorinated-gases-f-gases">hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants</a>, greenhouse gases thousands of times more powerful than CO<sub>2</sub> over a 20-year period.<br /><br />As the UK endures longer and more intense heatwaves, air conditioning here is becoming increasingly popular. By the end of the century, air conditioning could increase the UK’s power <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cooling-in-the-uk">consumption by up to an estimated 15% during the summer</a>.<br /><br />A more efficient air conditioner <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/zero-carbon-refrigeration-spin-out-sets-its-sights-on-environmentally-friendly-heating-systems">is being developed by Barocal, a spin-off company from Cambridge University</a>. This is a heat pump that does away with conventional refrigerants and uses solid materials to release or absorb heat at different pressures as they change volume. The materials are more efficient than liquid refrigerants, cheap and non-toxic, and the heat pumps can be used for either cooling or heating, helping solve two needs in one go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/23/heatwaves-pushing-up-demand-for-air-conditioning-in-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For years Tsang Tsou-choi daubed his eccentric demands around Hong Kong, and the authorities raced to cover them up. But as the city’s protest movements bloomed, his words mysteriously reappeared</p><p>The secret message only appeared when the wall was drenched with rain. For weeks, I had been scouring Hong Kong for these misshapen Chinese characters, but the way they materialised out of nowhere was a shock. It was an unremarkable yellow-grey stone wall in the middle of Central, Hong Kong’s political and economic heart. The words were only revealed when the wall had been soaked; in this case after a downpour in July 2015, which left the wall darkened and damp. Suddenly it was possible to see spots where the dove-grey paint had flaked off, revealing traces of Chinese calligraphy. The writing, in clumsy, off-balance characters about 20cm high, was instantly recognisable for its lack of grace, elegance or learning.</p><p>I can’t remember the first time I saw characters like these. They were everywhere when I was growing up in Hong Kong in the 1970s and 80s, a feature of our city just as much as the bottle-green snub-nosed <a href="http://www.starferry.com.hk/tc/home" title="">Star Ferry</a> and the noisy trams. Their author was a fixture of the landscape as well: a filthy, toothless, often shirtless, rubbish collector with mental health issues. He called himself the King of Kowloon. Hopping on his crutches, with plastic bags swinging from the handles, his crablike, bow-legged silhouette was so distinctive that, if people saw him in the distance, they would cross the road to avoid him. As he passed, parents would shield their kids’ eyes from him and mutter, “<em>Chi-sin a</em>!” Crazy! He even became a playground taunt – “You’re the King of Kowloon!” – levelled at the slow kids, the weird ones, the poor ones, the outcasts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/23/the-king-of-kowloon-my-search-for-the-cult-graffiti-prophet-of-hong-kong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 50 years, the prize has been scrapped. How did it change Britain’s literary landscape? And what happened at the awards when Margaret Drabble was seated next to Theresa May?</p><p>Margaret Drabble was a bright young star with five novels to her name in 1971, when she was talked into joining her old friend JB Priestley on the judging panel for a new book prize. “Jack told me that I should spend the fee (which came in wine) by choosing some very nice half-bottles to drink by myself, which I did,” she recalls.</p><p>Drabble argued for a biography of the playwright Henrik Ibsen, Priestley was keen on a novel by Gerda Charles, and their fellow judge, the critic Anthony Thwaite, championed a poetry collection by Geoffrey Hill. The glory of the new, brewery-sponsored awards was that all three could have prizes, so it all went swimmingly, with none of the squabbles that had already begun to bedevil the Booker, launched two years earlier. These arguments had included one over the literary quality of a certain Margaret Drabble, who (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/06/bookerprize.40years">according to Booker judge</a> Dame Rebecca West) would insist on lowering the tone by writing about the washing-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/23/shock-ending-how-costa-book-awards-changed-reading">Continue reading...</a>
