The future of abortion rights in America just got a bit more complicated now that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It makes me wonder, when is there actually going to be a male birth control pill?

Thank you to all of the people who sent in their experiences with hormonal birth control. Your voices are so important in this story. One of those was Sarah Dietschy, you can see her Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/saradietschy. So many of you responded with how hormonal birth control has made your life better. We didn’t have time to include these in the video, but you can watch some of those testimonials with this link: https://youtu.be/tHpZOKWCcnI
