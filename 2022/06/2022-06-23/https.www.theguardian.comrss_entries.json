The RMT, which was also involved in the Merseyrail negotiations said it plans to put the offer to its members.<br /><br />The RMT\u2019s general secretary Mick Lynch said the deal was an example of what can be achieved when ministers are not involved.<br /><br />Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: \u201cThe importance of that is the DFT (Department for Transport) and the Treasury are not pulling the strings in that negotiation.\u201d<br /><br />He added: \u201cThat\u2019s also the situation in other companies such as Transport for Wales, which is outside the DFTs control and Scotrail where we\u2019re going to get proposals on pay which are far superior to what [Transport Secretary] Grant Shapps will allow to happen.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhere Grant Shapps has no influence on this railway we are getting deals and getting offers that are likely to be more progressive than the ones we\u2019re getting from Westminster.\u201d<br /><br />Lynch added: \u201cWe need a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and when we get that we can move on positively to the other agenda items, which includes<br />changes to working practices, and the adoption of new technology.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt is the government in the form of Grant Shapps and the Treasury that are stopping those ideas coming forward. If we were dealing with the companies of their own volition ... I think we would have had a deal on these issues quite a long time ago.\u201d<br /><br />Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Eddie Dempsey, Assistant General Secretary of the RMT, said: \u201cWherever we\u2019re dealing with somebody who\u2019s not directly controlled by the DFT, we\u2019re making progress: London Underground 8.5%; Docklands Light Railway we\u2019ve got an inflation busting deal; Crossrail, saame thing, Transport for Wales we\u2019re in the business of negotiating something there now. Mercy rail 7.1%.\u201d<br /><br />But Tim Shoveller, Network Rail\u2019s chief negotiator, suggested it would be too expensive to offer a 7.1% pay increase to settle the national dispute.<br /><br />Speaking to the Today programme ahead of further talks today, Shoveller said: \u201cWe currently have an offer that totals 3% on the table and we\u2019re keen to improve on that. But that\u2019s subject to affordability.<br /><br />\u201cThe difference between the 3% on the table now and a 7.1% is \u00a365m every year just for the groups that are on strike today.\u201d<br /></p><p><em> I think every Labour MP should come out.
