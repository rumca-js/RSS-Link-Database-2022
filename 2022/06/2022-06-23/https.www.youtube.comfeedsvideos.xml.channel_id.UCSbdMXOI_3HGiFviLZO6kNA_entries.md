Today we dive into a video that has been on my mind and in the words for a LONG time. For the first time I put together all of the world's craziest VR hardware that anyone can purchase and recreated the setup found in Ready Player One's books/ movie. 

Super high resolution VR Headset: Varjo XR3
Omnidirection Treadmill: Katwalk C
Bhaptics Full body haptics
VRFree Gloves ( stopped working really early on) 
Celia Scent module 
Full Body Tracking vs TundraTrackers 
And more- 

All I have to say is.. I don't think we're quite ready for this.
