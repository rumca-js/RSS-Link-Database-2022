Modern Warfare 2’s beta could take place in August, Diablo 4’s game director explains why there are no new classes, and Starfield reveals the protagonist is silent.

#GamingNews #MW2 #Starfield

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting a beta, and according to an Amazon product page, it could be coming in August. The page for MW2 on PS5 says players who preorder will receive their beta code in August. The Xbox Series X|S page gets a little more specific and says those who preorder by August 15 will unlock early access to the open beta.

Last week Diablo 4 game director Joe Shely revealed why the game doesn’t have any brand new classes. According to Shely, the decision came down to player expectations and making sure that aspects fans remember from previous Diablo games are present in Diablo IV, albeit in a new, modern form.

Bethesda confirmed that you'll be a silent protagonist on its official Twitter account. Fan reaction seems split. Some have expressed disappointment in the silent protagonist trope, saying it breaks immersion. Others say they prefer silence, as opposed to hearing a performance of a line you just read.

We sat down with one of Redfall's directors, Harvey Smith, to talk about its new open world co-op vampire shooter Redfall.

Redfall is Arkane Austin's latest open world co-op vampire hunting shooter. During Summer Game Fest 2022, Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain sat down with one of Redfall's directors Harvey Smith to talk about the game, its mechanics, and the DNA it was founded on. In the above interview, Harvey gives insights to the game's identity, including its distinct take on vampires. 

Redfall may be a step-away from Arkane's signature take on single-player immersive sims, but Harvey details how much of Arkane's identity remains in the game, including dynamic dialogue, a heavy emphasis on lore, and giving the players the ability to approach situations in their own way. Redfall is expected to release in 2023. More in-depth look was revealed during the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase.
