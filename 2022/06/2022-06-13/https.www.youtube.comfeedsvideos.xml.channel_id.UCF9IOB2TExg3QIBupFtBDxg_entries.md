COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations for Children and Teens

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccines-children-teens.html

What You Need to Know

CDC recommends everyone ages 5 years and older get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Everyone ages 5 years and older should also get a COVID-19 booster, when eligible.

Booster, at least 5 months after primary course

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

advise that all children aged 5 to 11 are offered the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.

UK, 5 million age 5 to 11

Children aged 5 to 11 years will be offered 2 doses of the coronavirus vaccine.

JCVI advises a non-urgent offer of two 10 mcg doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®) to children aged 5 to 11 years of age who are not in a clinical risk group.

What about natural immunity

anti-N antibodies

As of February 2022, approximately 75% of children and adolescents had serologic evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, with approximately one third becoming newly seropositive since December 2021.

These findings illustrate a high infection rate for the Omicron variant, especially among children

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at or above 179 nanograms per millilitre (ng/ml), UK, 29 November 2021 to 15 May 2022

Testing negative means that an individual did not have enough antibodies to be detected in the test, not that they do not have any immune protection against the virus.

Pfizer booster dose, the evidence

36-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron neutralizing titers following a booster (third) dose

Phase 2/3 clinical trial with 140 children

a booster (third) dose increased neutralizing antibodies by 6-fold against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain

Cost of Pfizer vaccine for 5 to 11 year olds

Natural immunity

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm

CDC data from New York and California demonstrated that natural immunity was 2.8 times more effective in preventing hospitalization 

3.3 to 4.7 times more effective in preventing COVID infection compared to vaccination during the Delta wave.

Both evade immunity from vaccination or infection

South Africa

BA.4 and BA.5 variants had already swept through South Africa, no major problems

Despite multiple reinfections,

Deaths in South Africa were only around a tenth of the peak during previous waves

Previous immunity has not protected against BA.4 and BA.5 infections

Reinfections will increase immunity

December 2021

Qatar national cohort of 353,326 

N = 1,304 reinfections

Reinfections were rare and were generally mild

(Risk of re-infection, x8 in omicron times compared to delta times)

Reinfections had 90% lower odds of resulting in hospitalization or death than primary infections.
