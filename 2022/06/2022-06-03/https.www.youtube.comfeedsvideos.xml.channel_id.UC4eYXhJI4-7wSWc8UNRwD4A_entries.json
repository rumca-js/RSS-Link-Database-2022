Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk\u2019s unique way of showcasing that talent. \n\nNikki Birch | June 3, 2022\nA smile, laughter and a candle burning beside a delicate flower arrangement welcome us into the warm studio that is the set of James Francies\u2019 Tiny Desk (home) concert. The young Houstonian and Blue Note recording artist begins with the hypnotic grooves of \u201c713\u201d \u2014 one of our picks for the best songs of 2021. This tune allows Francies\u2019 virtuosic playing to shine, as he masterfully scales the keys during his solo. After a quick greeting, we\u2019re whisked away by the luscious string ensemble that introduces \u201cRose Water.\u201d Performed by vocalist Elliott Skinner, we\u2019re lifted by Skinner\u2019s voice as he sings beautifully of hope, support and growth: \u201cI wish that you could see the light / That radiates in everyday\u2026All the trials inside my mind / Shape me.\u201d \n\nFrancies ends his set with \u201cSway/Freedmen\u2019s Town.\u201d The jazz trio plays while a recording of the voice of Francies\u2019 father, James Francies Sr., tells the story of Freedmen\u2019s Town, a historic district of Houston now known as Fourth Ward. It\u2019s a fitting end to a Tiny Desk (home) concert that celebrates Black Music Month, a poignant and powerful reminder of how far we have come and what we still struggle against. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201c713\u201d\n\u201cRose Water\u201d\n\u201cSway/Freedmen\u2019s Town\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJames Francies: piano\nJeremy Dutton: drums\nOr Bareket: bass\nElliott Skinner: vocals \nFrancesca Dardani: violin\nAdriana Molello: violin\nTia Allen: viola\nMarta Bagratuni: cello\n\nCREDITS\nVideo by: Andy Schwartz, Andy Poland, Tripp Kramer  \nAudio By: Gosha Usov, Jason Rostkowski   \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O\u2019Neill\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAnimator: Kaz Fantone\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskconcert #jamesfrancies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVskXNb2PIM", "date_published": "2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
