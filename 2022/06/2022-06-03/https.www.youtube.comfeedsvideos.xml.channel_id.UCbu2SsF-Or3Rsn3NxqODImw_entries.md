Modern Warfare 2 gets an world premiere reveal date, Battlefield 2042’s Season 1 reveal is reportedly happening next week and Valve delays the Steam Deck dock.
#GamingNews #modernwarfare2 

The big world premiere of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is close! So close that it's less than a week away on June 8th. In an effort to build up further hype for the game, Activision released a live-action teaser trailer that shows a group of soldiers, Task Force 141, preparing to go behind enemy lines.

Valve has announced a delay for the Steam Deck Docking Station release due to a shortage of parts for the peripheral. Luckily, those who have preordered a Steam Deck don't have to worry about the dock's delay impacting any other timelines, as they use parts from different factories.

Battlefield 2042's long-awaited Season 1 update will be revealed officially next week. The reveal could happen--possibly with an accompanying trailer--on June 7, with impressions from media and other sources going live on June 8.

Resident Evil 4 Remake might be connected to RE Village, Street Fight 6 has brand new gameplay mechanics and Sony is increasing PS5 production. 
#GamingNews #RE4 #PS5

The June 3 PlayStation State of Play presentation had far more exciting content than we expected, including a number of upcoming PS5 and PSVR 2 games. It even included an unexpected PC announcement for Spider-Man and a remake of one of the most beloved Resident Evil games - Resident Evil 4. Talk about a very strong opener!

Reddit user Kaiju Media James pointed out a possible link between the two games. Kaiju wrote, “I noticed this symbol in the RE4R trailer, it looks somewhat similar to the Four Houses symbol in Village. Another user, lejitness, compared an image of Saddler from the new RE4 to one of Village’s Mother Miranda. What’s extra interesting about this frame of Saddler is that it comes right after the symbol is shown.

## The Box That Broke Baldur's Gate 3

Baldur's Gate III, like Dungeons & Dragons, is a game meant to evoke player freedom. But somewhere early in its making, a small decision was made that collided with that basic principle, and sent its development into a cascading spiral of problems. 

At the heart of an unforgettable Dungeons & Dragons campaign is a great dungeon master. It's their responsibility to guide the player on an adventure and make sure the world reacts to their actions in a way that feels natural and unplanned. 

For developer Larian Studios, to capture that D&D essence in Baldur's Gate 3, it has to evoke that same sense of freedom and role playing. It's collaborative storytelling between the player and the story. Every choice, action, reaction, and consequence has to feel like it really matters, no matter how big or small.

But somewhere early in the making of Baldur's Gate 3, the game's dungeon master, Swen Vincke, made a small decision that sent its development into a cascading spiral of problems that has been a big challenge to solve. And all it involved was getting the player to acquire one very specific item: the Mysterious Artefact and it belongs to a character named Shadowheart. In an effort to get the player to receive this item as elegantly and naturally as possible, as though it was their own decision, has resulted in creating 100s of possibilities that plagued the game's development.

This is the story of how the Mysterious Artefact broke Baldur's Gate 3.
