Thats why I\u2019m starting a Patreon - just for that. To consistently bring you more music and content that\u2019s fun, groovy, positive - everything that brings us a good time.\n\nI\u2019m really thankful that you\u2019re here to give me the privilege of your time and your attention, and I hope to bring you some great tunes and fun moments to share. \n\nI\u2019d love for you to be a part of this - the Patreon will have have Q&As, voting on which movie lines to remix, exclusive downloads, livestreams and more. If you enjoy my stuff, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy being a part of my community. I\u2019ll be active there and I'd love to interact with you.\n\nI\u2019ll still be making music and remixes here on youtube, and some special content will be specific for patrons only. \n\nClick on the link and see if you dig anything, I hope you do.\n\nBut whether you do or not, I still appreciate you very much, the fact that you\u2019re watching this, and that you enjoy being here and dig the music and videos, that means a lot to me\n\nSo take care, have a great day, and see you on Patreon :)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5IZSHUe8fY", "date_published": "2022-06-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCIw5fgJcTtR2Av-0JkZp-xg", "title": "\"Emotional Damage!\" / Remixing @StevenHe", "description": "Support my music on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/yuriwong Created on @teenageengineering OP-1\nand completed in Logic Pro X using stock plugins and instruments.\n\n0:00 Making-of\n2:55 Full Song", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59QzKeb6lU8", "date_published": "2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
