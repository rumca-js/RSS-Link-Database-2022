Can you talk about the decision to lose loot boxes?\n\n08:37 - For a lot of people the loot boxes were the proverbial carrot on the stick. What becomes that now for players?\n\n09:03 - There's also Mythic skins. How are they going to work?\n\n10:04 - What's the rollout of these going to be? \n\n10:15 - Speaking of the new heroes, can you talk about Junker Queen?\n\n12:03 - How feasible is a new hero every two seasons from a design, development, and production perspective and are you locked into [that timing]? \n\n13:04 - The introduction of a new hero every two seasons also has major implications on the metagame. Are you pre-planning meta changes as well as pre-planning new characters? \n\n14:26 - So the first roadmap is going to be for a year. How long internally have you planned out for?\n\n15:32 - Is there any scope for creating some sort of system where large groups and Overwatch friend circles will be able to still play together?\n\n17:19 - For many PvP and PvE to thee was the complete package for Overwatch 2. Can you talk about the decision to decouple them? \n\n18:48 - You showed off a new origin story and cinematic. Now that you have a PvE component, are we going to be seeing more stuff like that within the PvE?\n\n20:09 - Can you tell us about the new map coming in the beta?\n\n22:53 - There's the cadence for hero release. Is there any sort of cadence with regard to adding new maps or even new modes to the game?\n\n23:36 - Overwatch as a game is being developed by Blizzard, which is owned by Activision Blizzard, and there are things that are happening within the industry that are [then] associated with the team, and the conversation that needs to happen for people like us who love Overwatch and are so excited is how do we reconcile that excitement with what is going on with the parent company? So we have to try and ask for a transparent look at what the Overwatch development team is currently like.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU538SH3A-k", "date_published": "2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Prime Matter Anniversary Show Livestream", "description": "Tune in for the 1 year anniversary celebration of Prime Matter, who is bring us new games such as System Shock and The Chant.

Ahead of the next Overwatch 2 beta, where the new hero Junker Queen and new map Paraiso will officially debut in the game, we went to Blizzard HQ to speak with the game's director Aaron Keller about what we can expect from Overwatch 2 when it launches on October 4, 2022.\n\nNot only is the game going free-to-play, but Overwatch 2 is losing its loot boxes, instead opting for an in-game store and a Battle Pass to deal out unlockables, which now include weapon charms and Mythic Skins. Aaron also discusses what happened to Overwatch 2's PvE content: earlier in 2022, Blizzard announced that it was being \"decoupled\" from the PvP, but in this video, he goes into detail on how we'll be able to play the new mode next year. He also details the game's newest tank hero, Junker Queen, and we get a look at two new maps, Paraiso in Rio, and Portugal. \n\nOverwatch 2 will have cross-platform play and cross-progression when it launches on October 4th for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. The next beta will start on June 28, and while progress won't carry over to the final game, it's a chance to play the new hero, Junker Queen for the first time. \n\nActivision Blizzard continues to address allegations from a state of California lawsuit accusing parent company Activision Blizzard of fostering a \"frat boy culture\" of harassment and discrimination against women.
