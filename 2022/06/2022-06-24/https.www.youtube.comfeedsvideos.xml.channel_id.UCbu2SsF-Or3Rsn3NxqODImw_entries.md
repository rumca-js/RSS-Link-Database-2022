FromSoftware is almost done with its new game, Assassin’s Creed developer reveals the horses are actually twisted humans and Halo Master Chief Collection cosmetic Microtransactions being explored by 343.
#GamingNews #EldenRing #Halo

FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed in an interview with 4Gamer that an unannounced project is in the final stages of development. This project is described as a more abstract fantasy that uses ideas that don't quite fit into the usual Souls-like adventure template. But regardless of what is being worked on, Elden Ring will still continue to receive support in the future, although Miyazaki mentioned that he wasn't ready to reveal what fans could expect to see next.

Former Ubisoft developer Charles Randall tweeted, "The horse in AC1 was just a twisted f***ed-up human skeleton because our tool chain only worked with biped in 3ds max. Cheers to the amazing animators and riggers that managed to make that guy look like a horse!" Randall also revealed that for the character of Malik, who only had one arm, Ubisoft didn't have the budget for a custom skeleton so the solution was to turn his extra limb inside out and push it up into his abdomen.

343 Industries has confirmed that it is exploring the idea of adding microtransactions to Halo: The Master Chief Collection. In an update on the Waypoint site, community writer Alex Wakeford explained that 343 will be renaming Season Points as Spartan Points and is looking into adding a new form of microtransactions.
