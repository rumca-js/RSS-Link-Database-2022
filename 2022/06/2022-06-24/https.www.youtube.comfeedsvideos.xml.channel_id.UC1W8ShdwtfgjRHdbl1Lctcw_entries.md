I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of 1903 shows the streets of Boston crowded with horse-drawn carriages. Ladies in long dresses and huge hats walk with dignity along the sidewalks as the camera pans to see the crowds of businessmen and shoppers milling about the streets. There are some familiar sites. A Jordan Marsh store makes an appearance, as does the Boston Public Library and Beacon Street.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to 4K
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
