As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, those who provide history and context around the conflict – from Chomsky to Tucker Carlson - continue to be silenced and smeared. But as sanctions on Russia only seem to be hurting everyday Americans, isn’t it time we had a real debate about the Ukraine war? #putin #biden #Ukraine

The pandemic was not the "great equalizer" that some predicted. Now, after two years of struggle, everyday people are again struggling, this time due to inflation.
