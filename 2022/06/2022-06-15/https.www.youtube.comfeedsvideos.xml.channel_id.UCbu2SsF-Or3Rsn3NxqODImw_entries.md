Elden Ring gets a new mod for Malenia fans, new Overwatch 2 details are revealed and Call of Duty: Season 4 gets additional information. 
#GamingNews #EldenRing #overwatch2 

What if every enemy in Elden Ring was Malenia? That's something youtuber Bushy must’ve asked before using the fifth matt’s enemy randomiser mod to turn every boss, normal enemy and even wildlife into the game’s toughest boss. Bushy documented the whole experience on YouTube and somehow still managed to beat the game in around 8 hours despite the constant appearance of Malenia. At times Bushy faced 3 to 5 of them at a time, yet still persevered.

Overwatch 2 is going free-to-play, and Blizzard promise a lot more new content a lot more regularly. We spoke to the game’s director Aaron Keller about how it’s all going to work.

#ow2 #overwatch2 #gamespot 

Overwatch 2 is officially going free-to-play, but that's not the biggest change coming to the game. Ahead of the next Overwatch 2 beta, where the new hero Junker Queen and new map Paraiso will officially debut in the game, we went to Blizzard HQ to speak with the game's director Aaron Keller about what we can expect from Overwatch 2 when it launches on October 4, 2022.

Not only is the game going free-to-play, but Overwatch 2 is losing its loot boxes, instead opting for an in-game store and a Battle Pass to deal out unlockables, which now include weapon charms and Mythic Skins. Aaron also discusses what happened to Overwatch 2's PvE content: earlier in 2022, Blizzard announced that it was being "decoupled" from the PvP, but in this video, he goes into detail on how we'll be able to play the new mode next year. He also details the game's newest tank hero, Junker Queen, and we get a look at two new maps, Paraiso in Rio, and Portugal. 

Overwatch 2 will have cross-platform play and cross-progression when it launches on October 4th for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. The next beta will start on June 28, and while progress won't carry over to the final game, it's a chance to play the new hero, Junker Queen for the first time. 

Activision Blizzard continues to address allegations from a state of California lawsuit accusing parent company Activision Blizzard of fostering a "frat boy culture" of harassment and discrimination against women.

PS5 might be getting a new pro controller, Fallout 5 is coming after Elder Scroll 6 and the Overwatch 2 beta begins June 16.
#GamingNews #PS5 #fallout5 

According to a new report, Sony is releasing a PlayStation 5 pro controller with removable analog sticks and rear paddle triggers, similar to the Xbox Elite controller. The report also claims Sony will reveal new hardware--but not a new console--at the end of June, though it's unclear if this rumored new controller may be part of that. 

Bethesda's Todd Howard has confirmed that the studio plans to work on Fallout 5 following the completion of The Elder Scrolls VI. During a new interview Howard spoke about what the studio has planned after Starfield, and he touched on the progress of The Elder Scrolls VI by stating that the project was still in pre-production.

## TMNT: Shredder's Revenge Casey Jones Gameplay

Fan favorite character Casey Jones was recently revealed as a playable character in the most recent DotEmu beat 'em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and we have the first 11 minutes of gameplay for you to check out!

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are no strangers to being put into great arcade beat 'em ups and the latest one from DotEmu is no exception. This time not only are Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Rafael all coming back but they brought some friends with them as well! Aside from the turtles players can finally play as their wise teacher and father figure Master Splinter, their best friend and occasional pizza supplier April O'Niel, and also fan favorite Casey Jones who brings his all of his favorite, even iconic sports equipment along with him to keep back any villains who are unfortunate enough to find themselves on the business end of his hockey stick. All of these characters return with classing moves and throws and even have some new ones to make sure the beat downs stay fresh.

Casey Jones himself is a character you can't use at the beginning of the game. To unlock Casey Jones you have to finish story mode once, which shouldn't be too difficult of a task. Once you lay the smack down on the last boss you'll get a notification that you have unlocked the hockey mask wearing hero to play in all of the games modes!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is available on June 16th, 2022 on Windows, Steam, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
