I'm pretty terrible at From Soft games and I'm not great at Souls games either, so naturally I decided to lay my life on the line and punish myself for it. Why? There's literally no good reason. Sorry to disappoint you. Maybe if you actually started conversations with me every once in a while you wouldn't get this treatment from me. I'm always the one initiating. I know somethings going on.
