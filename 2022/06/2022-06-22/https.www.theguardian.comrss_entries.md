Although she did not consider it an addiction at the time, she found herself playing regularly over five years before deciding, she said, that “the gambler never wins” and she was “wasting valuable time which would be better spent with friends and family”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/23/s-club-7-star-calls-out-lack-of-empathy-for-gambling-addicts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s all change at Chelsea after Granovskaia’s exit but the club’s new co-owner, chairman and sporting director has a big task</p><p>As recently as a week ago Marina Granovskaia was telling figures inside football that she had not decided whether to continue working for Chelsea’s new owners. Granovskaia was as active as ever in discussions with agents about potential signings and, despite the director’s long-standing ties to Roman Abramovich, there was a feeling that any announcement about her future would be unlikely until the transfer window was over.</p><p>That all changed on Monday morning. First came the announcement that Bruce Buck, another associate of Abramovich, had agreed to step down as chairman. Then, in a development that caught a fair few people by surprise, it emerged that Granovskaia would indeed be the next high-profile departure. Ties with the previous regime were being cut and, though there were initially suggestions that Granovskaia would keep her job until the end of August, by the end of the day several sources were tipping her to be gone before the end of the week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jun/22/todd-boehly-thomas-tuchel-guadiola-klopp-chelsea-granovskaia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plans to make universal rights subordinate to ministerial opinion and political whim mark a backwards step for British democracy</p><p>There are two ways ministers can avoid falling foul of human rights law. One is to govern with respect for universal human rights, as codified after the second world war in response to unspeakable atrocities. The other way is to redefine those rights, making their interpretation subordinate to political expediency. Boris Johnson’s government has chosen the second path.</p><p>The method is a new <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0117/220117.pdf" title="">bill of rights</a>, replacing the 1998 Human Rights Act, which incorporated the 1953 European convention on human rights into UK law. The change is not a withdrawal from the European court of human rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, which adjudicates on the convention, but it is a dilution of the protections it represents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-raabs-bill-of-rights-liberty-bent-to-prejudice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We were told privatisation would mean great services, savings for the government and an investment boom. It was a lie</p><p>Three ghastly faces of the UK’s privatised economy have been on show this week. On Wednesday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, was judged guilty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/22/failing-energy-suppliers-cost-uk-consumers-2-billion-pounds-watchdog" title="">adding £2.7bn to household bills</a> because it was so keen to create a competitive energy market that it did not properly check the slew of shaky outfits setting up as suppliers. Now that 28 providers have collapsed, such light-touch regulation is producing costly chaos – not only for customers of Bulb and the others, but for everyone, because we will all foot the bill.</p><p>Earlier, Anglian Water announced that it would pay a £92m dividend to investors, despite the Environment Agency fining it for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/severn-trent-and-anglian-water-pledge-to-do-more-to-protect-rivers" title="">water pollution</a> on three separate occasions in the past few months.

## Boris produces bubbles of nonsense when quizzed about Carrie | John Crace

<p>A Labour question rattled Johnson at PMQs, and then a revitalised Keir Starmer pounced</p><p>Boris Johnson could count himself lucky. He wasn’t up against the RMT union leader. Mick Lynch has already seen off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2022/jun/22/marxist-the-hood-rmt-mick-lynch-asked-bizarre-questions-rail-strikes-video">Kay Burley, Piers Morgan</a>, Labour’s Jenny Chapman and several half-witted Tory MPs. Chris Philp and Jonathan Gullis were chewed up and spat out. So it would be a racing certainty that the Convict would come off worse in any one-to-one with Lynch. One very good reason why the Tories have made no effort to engage with the RMT.</p><p>But the Convict did have to face a revitalised Keir Starmer. In recent weeks, the Labour leader has seemed underpowered. As if his mind was elsewhere. But at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions he was fully on it. Not all the gags landed, but then they didn’t need to. Johnson looked hopelessly out of his depth from the start. Powerless to defend his record. Not even the Tories now believe the Tory line that Labour is to blame for the rail strikes. More to the point, the public certainly seem to know where the fault lies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/22/boris-johnson-produces-bubbles-of-nonsense-when-quizzed-about-carrie">Continue reading...</a>

She is right, of course, just as the Labour party is wrong when its leaders keep hiding behind the “we can’t tell you what we would do to solve the problem because the election is two years away” fence. We still don’t know what Labour really stands for, and it doesn’t appear to have the big beasts capable or willing to tell us.</p><p>In 2001, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/29/uk.election20015" title="">Jonathan Freedland quoted</a> the historian Ze’ev Mankowitz as saying that “people don’t believe in ideas: they believe in people who believe in ideas”, illustrating Labour’s then weakness.

The cost of living has not been rising this fast since the Falklands war. Prices are climbing faster than wages. In every respect bar one, this is clearly bad news. The best that Britain can hope for in the months ahead is a period of stagflation: weak growth and rapidly rising prices. If things get really bad, we could be on course for an “incession” – high inflation combined with a recession. Either way, the outlook is grim, especially for those on the lowest incomes, who spend most on energy and food, for which price increases are heftiest.</p><p>The one consolation is that high inflation acts as a national wake-up call. Or at least it should do. For far too long, the UK has drifted along convinced that all is well because cheap imports from China are keeping inflation low and rock-bottom interest rates are fuelling a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-all-time-low-of-01are">house-price boom</a>. It would be nice to think we have finally woken up to reality. But that in itself is an illusion. Just as in the 1970s, the economy’s structural weaknesses have been exposed by a period when prices are hurtling upwards. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/22/stagflation-britain-rising-prices-recession-inflation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the 1990s, wine production was seen as an eccentric hobby. Now, despite their relatively high cost, England is home to some wines of outstanding quality</p><p>Having spent much of my working life with winemakers who never had to leave home to find their dream job, I’ve sometimes wondered what it might be like to have been born and raised in a great wine region. Would it have stripped away the romantic lens through which British wine lovers like me tend to view places such as Burgundy or Barossa? Or would I now be filled with the same easy pride that Burgundians and Barossans, even those who don’t work in the wine business, feel about their local product?</p><p>Probably the latter, given recent developments in the part of Essex where I grew up. Praise for the latest wine produced within a 10-mile radius of where I was born always provides a little flutter of positivity and recognition, not unlike coming across my small town on TV as a kid (“Look, we’re on <em>Lovejoy</em>!”) . Over the past decade place names from bus routes of my childhood have been infused with a sense of glamour. Danbury, Althorne, Latchingdon, Purleigh are all home to vineyards, and wines, that have helped set the new mood in English wine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jun/22/its-never-been-easier-to-love-english-wine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The newly minted Hall of Famer opens up about her trials outside the ring: substance abuse, domestic violence and an attempted murder by her husband, who left her to die on their bedroom floor</p><p>Christy Martin’s original story, the well-trodden narrative of the coal miner’s daughter from West Virginia who left home and stepped into the boxing ring for her professional debut in 1989, ends on the floor of her bedroom in Apopka, Florida, on 23 November 2010. She was 42 years old. At the time, she was the welterweight champion who put women’s boxing on the map, the first female to sign with the sport’s iconic promoter, Don King, the first and, to this day, only, female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.</p><p>Those bits of history were the stuff used to frame her rise, to shape her career within the narrative arc of an underdog. Stories that sung the barriers she’d broken and records she’d set. But they omitted chunks of reality. Christy was gay, and trapped in a violent marriage to her manager, Jim Martin, who was 25 years her senior. She constantly needed to get high. And on that early November evening in 2010, Jim, her then-husband, who was also her abuser and cocaine supplier, her blackmailer and confidant, stabbed her three times and shot her in the chest. There would be no more separation between who she was in public and how she survived at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/22/boxing-legend-christy-martin-my-husband-told-me-for-20-years-he-would-kill-me">Continue reading...</a>
