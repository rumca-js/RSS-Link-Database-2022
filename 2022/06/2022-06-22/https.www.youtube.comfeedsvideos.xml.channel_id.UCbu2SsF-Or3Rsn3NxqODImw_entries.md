During a Reddit AMA, Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller confirmed, “When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service”. According to Blizzard, this is to keep the player base unified and as for the players that can’t let go of the past and try to play OW1 after October 4th, they'll be asked to update to the sequel instead.

In Respawn's mobile battle royale, Apex Legends Mobile, being able to successfully pull off the bunny hopping technique can make you extremely difficult to hit. This has created frustration in the community so it's good to see Respawn finally address it with an upcoming nerf. The change will be made in the game's next update.

Xbox Cloud Steaming will add mouse and keyboard support to its streaming service. This announcement was made by Xbox software engineer, Morgan Brown. During a presentation, Brown clarified that mouse and keyboard support for Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming and that developers should work on adding it to their games.

Focus Entertainment has revealed that A Plague Tale: Requiem will launch on October 18 for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S. In an extended gameplay trailer, Focus Entertainment showed off more of the game, and it looks even more cinematic than its predecessor. It shows the protagonist Amicia and her little brother Hugo trying to escape enemies while she fights them off.
