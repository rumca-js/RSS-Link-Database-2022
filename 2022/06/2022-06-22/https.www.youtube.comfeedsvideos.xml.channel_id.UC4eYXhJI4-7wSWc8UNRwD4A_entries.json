This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nSuraya Mohamed | June 23, 2022\nAlmost 30 musicians, choir members and staff of the contemporary worship music collective Maverick City Music entered the NPR lobby and crowded the security desk to undergo COVID protocols. Even through the dull process of checking vaccination cards and test results, there was a real feeling of excitement for what was about to happen.\n\nSome of the choir members were eager not only for the upcoming Tiny Desk concert but for later that evening, when they were scheduled to perform at a sold-out 20,000-seat arena nearby. A few of them had only previously performed with Maverick City Music in small venues and couldn't wait to move from the Tiny Desk to a big stage. Once upstairs, the group's enthusiasm grew during the set up and sound check. Even the NPR production staff was buzzing because we had not recorded such a large ensemble in our office in more than two years.\n\nOnce the performance started, Maverick City Music did what it always does. The members of the group became one voice, sharing beautiful music and spreading the good word with messages of hope, change and love. The group describes itself as a megaphone for a community of creatives that has been pushed to the margins of the industry of church music. Even for those who aren't fans of gospel music or for those who don't believe, it is possible to still find appreciation in this music's comforting and uplifting sound.\n\nMost of the songs performed here are from the collective's new album, Kingdom Book One, which was produced in collaboration with gospel legend Kirk Franklin. It was a blessing to watch him perform here alongside talented vocalists Naomi Raine and Chandler Moore on the last song, \"Kingdom.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Man of Your Word\"\n\"Million Little Miracles\"\n\"Jireh\"\n\"Kingdom\" (feat.

This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 22, 2022\nHearing Ravyn Lenae\u2019s voice resonate from behind the Tiny Desk for one of our first concerts back in the building had me entranced. With her voice raw and unamplified, Lenae and her dynamic band transformed our office into a funky, futuristic space where she was completely in her element. \n\nHailing from Chicago, Lenae dropped her first EP, Moon Shoes, in 2015. Since then, she\u2019s released two more EPs, her sound permeating the world of contemporary R&B and blurring the lines between soul, funk and R&B. This year Lenae reemerged with the release of her debut full length, HYPNOS, already shaping up to be one of the best albums of 2022. \n\nHer Tiny Desk concert commences with three songs off HYPNOS. Opening with \u201cVenom,\u201d an electro-funk song that seethes, Lenae sings: \u201cWhy do you play me for a fool?\u201d Her signature falsetto descends over spacey synth melodies while her drummer keeps an insistent, metallicy groove. Then Lenae performs perhaps the most vulnerable songs from her new album, including \u201cSkin Tight,\u201d a melancholic guitar-led ballad that addresses a past romantic relationship and the energy that was once shared, and \u201cInside Out,\u201d a love letter to herself that channels a \u201990s R&B sound with dramatic piano harmonies, a soulful lead melody and dynamic drums. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a lifelong journey, learning to love yourself and trust yourself, and believe in the skin you\u2019re in,\u201d Lenae says of \u201cInside Out.\u201d \u201cI wrote this song when I wasn\u2019t so sure\u2026 that\u2019s why we sing it together.\u201d With a fiercely energetic upsweep, she closes the show with her hit \u201cSticky.\u201d As she slides into those distinct shrilling oohs, I can\u2019t help but sing along to her catchy hook \u2014 all while realizing that only Lenae can do it quite like that. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cVenom\u201d\n\u201cSkin Tight\u201d\n\u201cInside Out\u201d\n\u201cSticky\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nRavyn Lenae: vocals\nMarcus Reddick: bass\nDanielle \u201cDee\u201d Thompson: drums\nHarrison \u201cAchee\u201d Hawkins: keys/MD\nGarrett Jones: guitar\nAja Grant: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Josh Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #RavynLenae", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsDT5Wa0hwI", "date_published": "2022-06-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
