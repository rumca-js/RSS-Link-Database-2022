recognised proof of natural immunity,\n\nsufficient basis for exemption to vaccination requirements. \n\nArguments\n\nTwo implausible claims about natural immunity: \n\nNatural immunity is superior to \u2018artificial\u2019 immunity\n\nIt is better to acquire immunity through natural infection\n\nNaturalistic fallacy (many things are natural, but not good)\n\n(A natural public health strategy, increased overall morbidity and mortality)\n\nWe lack clear and convincing scientific evidence that vaccine-induced immunity has a significantly higher protective effect than natural immunity.\n\nVaccine requirements represent a substantial infringement of individual liberty, and other significant costs\n\nCan only be justified if they are necessary for achieving a proportionate public health benefit. \n\nWithout compelling evidence for the superiority of vaccine-induced immunity, it cannot be deemed necessary to require vaccination for those with natural immunity.

Analysis\n\nhttps://www.cureus.com/articles/72074-e\n\nAll of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the protection of full vaccination and natural immunity; \n\nand,
