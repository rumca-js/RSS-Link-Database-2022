Hyenas is a team-based shooter from Creative Assembly that tasks players with robbing high-tech vaults on massive space freighters. Each match has 15 players split into 3 teams of 5 and the loot that is being stolen includes pop culture artifacts. No release date was announced for Hyenas, but if you have a PC and you live in North America or Europe you can sign up for the upcoming alpha on the game’s official website. 

Today’s Nintendo Direct laid out the game's story and battle system, focusing on the party's six classes and their abilities. Those classes include: Swordfighter, Zephyr, Medic Gunner, Tactician, Heavy Guard, and Ogre. Nintendo also revealed the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass, adding over a year's worth of additional content for $30. 

Forza Horizon’s latest major update adds story mode co-op, a new event, and new Hot Wheels cars and cosmetics ahead of the July expansion's release.
