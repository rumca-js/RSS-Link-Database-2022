Sometimes you have to go slow to go fastâ€”with 60 hard drives on 1 Raspberry Pi, I found a way to make it run in RAID!

It's not the fastest storage server in town, but it's good for about 70 MB/sec write speeds and sucks down about 500 Watts of power.

Many questions viewers have about the PetaPi are answered in this video.
