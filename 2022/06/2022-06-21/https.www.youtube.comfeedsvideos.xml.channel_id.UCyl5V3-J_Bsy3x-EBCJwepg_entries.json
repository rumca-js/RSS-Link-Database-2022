As a former liberal, Brandon Straka started the Walk Away social media campaign to encourage liberals to leave the Democratic Party and he was there on that fateful day in our nation\u2019s capital. Subsequently, his house raided by the FBI and he was arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for the role officials say he took in an insurrection against the government. May Brandon have committed some light treason?
