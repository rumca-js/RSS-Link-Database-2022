Brandon Straka joined The Babylon Bee to talk about being arrested for participating in what is being called the 2021 United States Capitol Attack. As a former liberal, Brandon Straka started the Walk Away social media campaign to encourage liberals to leave the Democratic Party and he was there on that fateful day in our nation’s capital. Subsequently, his house raided by the FBI and he was arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for the role officials say he took in an insurrection against the government. May Brandon have committed some light treason? We interview, you decide.

YouTube restricted this video the first time we uploaded it since they decided that footage from the BLM riots was too violent. So we toned it down a notch for all to enjoy free of age restriction. Enjoy our touching music video covering the 525,600 minutes of mainstream media hyping up the January 6 Capitol riots while downplaying the BLM riots. 

Our own parody inspired by Colbert's parody of Seasons of Love.
