We got some hands on time with Escape Academy, and upcoming Room Escape game created by former Escape Room designers. After the lockdown, the designers wanted to keep making escape rooms, and found themselves delving into digital escape games. Dave and Jordan were able to co-op and solve the puzzles to give their first impressions of the game.

While Room Escape games have existed ever since the advent of Flash, with games like Crimson Room starting the trend, we haven't seen physical escape room designers attempt a digital escape room like this before. The game is built with co-op in mind, just like real life escape rooms, meaning their are plenty of puzzles that are built with the idea of playing with friends. The puzzle types vary through-out rooms, and there are often timers giving players a sense of urgency. Jordan and Dave discuss their utter joy at where the game seems to be heading.
