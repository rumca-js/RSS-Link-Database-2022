BA.4 and BA.5 variants had already swept through South Africa, no major problems

Despite multiple reinfections,

Deaths in South Africa were only around a tenth of the peak during previous waves

December 2021

Qatar national cohort of 353,326 

N = 1,304 reinfections

Reinfections were rare and were generally mild

(Risk of re-infection, x8 in omicron times compared to delta times)

Reinfections had 90% lower odds of resulting in hospitalization or death than primary infections.
