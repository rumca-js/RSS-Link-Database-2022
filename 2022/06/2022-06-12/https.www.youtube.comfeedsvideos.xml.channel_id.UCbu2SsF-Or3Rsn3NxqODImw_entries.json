All the footage in the trailer was captured on an Xbox Series X. They showcase character customization so that you can make a character thats unique to you visually. They also talk about the Open World that speaks to no linear path that a player has to follow. \n\nAdditionally we hear about strongholds that we have to reclaim, which becomes a friendly town to you. We get a look at local events and a first look at a new world boss. The game has cross play at least between Xbox and PC, as specified in the trailer.

After the lockdown, the designers wanted to keep making escape rooms, and found themselves delving into digital escape games. Dave and Jordan were able to co-op and solve the puzzles to give their first impressions of the game.\n\nWhile Room Escape games have existed ever since the advent of Flash, with games like Crimson Room starting the trend, we haven't seen physical escape room designers attempt a digital escape room like this before. The game is built with co-op in mind, just like real life escape rooms, meaning their are plenty of puzzles that are built with the idea of playing with friends. The puzzle types vary through-out rooms, and there are often timers giving players a sense of urgency. Jordan and Dave discuss their utter joy at where the game seems to be heading.\n\n#summergamefest #escapeacademy #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlO4bSBxS5I", "date_published": "2022-06-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Every Reveal for The Xbox & Bethesda Showcase in 10 Minutes", "description": "Don't want to sit through the entire Xbox and Bethesda Showcase?
