With the Drive Gauge you are able to perform five different techniques that can enhance your offense or defense. One of the five is the Drive Impact which is a powerful strike that can absorb an opponent\u2019s incoming attack and can lead to a wall splat. Whereas you can use Drive Parry to repel your opponent\u2019s attack and refill your Drive Gauge. Additionally, you can cancel your Drive Parry or normal attack into a Drive Rush to quickly close in on your opponent and also play mind games. Overdrive Arts are similar to EX Moves from previous Street Fighter games that enhance your Special Moves. Finally the fifth option in the new Drive System, is Drive Reversal which allows you to perform a counterattack to get you out of sticky situations. This new drive system gives players a lot of flexibility and creativity to best their opponents in Street Fighter 6.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is coming out in 2023!\n\n#StreetFighter6 #summergamefest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iIsCGtKaWU", "date_published": "2022-06-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "TMNT: Shredder's Revenge New Gameplay | Guerrilla Collective 3.0", "description": "Check out a few minutes of new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge gameplay.
