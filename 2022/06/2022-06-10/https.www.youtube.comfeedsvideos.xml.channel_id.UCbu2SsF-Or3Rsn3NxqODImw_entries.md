Capcom's Street Fighter 6 is one of the biggest games of Summer Game Feast and the PlayStation 5 version of the fighting game was playable at the show.

GameSpot’s resident fighting game fan got hands-on time with the game, putting the Drive system through its passes to find out how mechanically dense the latest entry in the stories fighting game franchise is, and how it feels. In this video you'll see Ryu, Chun-li, Luke, and newcomer Jamie battle it out for supremacy.

You'll also get a good look at how the various parry and reversal systems work, as well as how the cinematic Critical Arts will bring some bombast to the brawls.

We get to try out the new drive system. With the Drive Gauge you are able to perform five different techniques that can enhance your offense or defense. One of the five is the Drive Impact which is a powerful strike that can absorb an opponent’s incoming attack and can lead to a wall splat. Whereas you can use Drive Parry to repel your opponent’s attack and refill your Drive Gauge. Additionally, you can cancel your Drive Parry or normal attack into a Drive Rush to quickly close in on your opponent and also play mind games. Overdrive Arts are similar to EX Moves from previous Street Fighter games that enhance your Special Moves. Finally the fifth option in the new Drive System, is Drive Reversal which allows you to perform a counterattack to get you out of sticky situations. This new drive system gives players a lot of flexibility and creativity to best their opponents in Street Fighter 6.

Street Fighter 6 is coming out in 2023!

The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a survival crafting game set in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, in the iconic fantasy world created by J.R.R. Tolkien.

"Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria--known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf--in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures."

The game takes place in the Dwarven realm of Moria and has procedurally generated worlds so "no two adventures are alike," the developers said. The game is playable solo or in co-op.
