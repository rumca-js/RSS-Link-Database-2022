The GameSpot News of the day is a double dose of Mjolnir might. Plus, an upcoming test flight for Halo Infinite will give players a taste of campaign co-op.\n\nDetails of God of War Ragnarok\u2019s collector\u2019s editions have reportedly leaked. Amid a whirlwind of rumors around an upcoming announcement for the game\u2019s release date are details of what fans could expect the more pricey versions of it to include. According to the leaks, the tier above the standard release will be known as the J\u00f6tnar edition, referencing the giants of J\u00f6tunheim. This edition will include a 1:1 replica of the game\u2019s version of Mjolnir, which was briefly teased at the very end of God of War 2018. Considering Thor will be a major character in the upcoming sequel, the mighty weapon is likely to be prominently featured in the game. There will also reportedly be an even pricier collector\u2019s edition beyond that, including a map of the game world, badges, and potentially additional items.\n\nOf course, the biggest question on everyone\u2019s mind is when we can get our hands on the game. For those eager to know the answer, may I remind you that God of War 2018\u2019s release date was only announced a mere 3 months beforehand, giving the team at Sony Santa Monica plenty of time to make the reveal for Ragnarok, even if it is still coming out this Holiday.\n\nFrom one Mjolnir to another, Xbox is giving away another limited edition Series X, this time in celebration of the release of the upcoming Marvel film Thor Love and Thunder. The design is a match made in Asgard for the boxy console, which is wrapped in a skin to replicate the God of Thunder\u2019s trusty hammer Mjolnir. Featuring cracks along its faces to resemble its reforging after its destruction at the hands of Hela, Goddess of Death, in Thor Ragnarok, the promotional image of the Xbox also features the weapon\u2019s handle sticking out from the back side. If the handle is indeed a part of the final product, hopefully the winner is worthy of this godly gift so they can actually pick it to put on their TV stand.\n\nThe giveaway also features a custom Mjolnir Xbox controller, although there are no images of that at this time. To enter, Twitter users simply need to retweet the Xbox account\u2019s post with #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. \n\nFrom one Mjolnir to another, \n\nOf course, the biggest question on everyone\u2019s mind is when we can get our hands on the game.

Sorry, no local co-operative at the moment still. Players will need to sign up for the test flight, which will occur in a separate instance of the game from any progress you\u2019ve made thus far in the campaign, and any progress you make in the test flight cannot be brought over.\n\nOne of the main pain points according to the team on getting online campaign co-op up and running was the game becoming unstable when players strayed too far away from one another. In the test flight, teammates will only be able to stray 800 feet away from anyone else in the group before getting a warning to return. At 1000 feet, that player is respawned immediately back with their team. 343 industries\u2019 primary software engineer lead Isaac Bender assures players that that distance is enough for teams to attack the campaign\u2019s biggest Covenant bases from opposite sides with room to spare.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today\u2019s GameSpot News!

Let\u2019s talk about what made the game so special.\u00a0\n\nTime Code:\u00a0\n00:00 - 00:26\u00a0 Intro\n00:27 - 08:14\u00a0 Campaign\n08:15 - 13:00 Multiplayer\n13:02\u00a0 - 16:10 Warzone\n16:11 - 20:30 Modern Warfare 2\n20:21 - 21:26 Audience Questions\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 by Infinity Ward was a big departure from classic Call of Duty Games. It had a gritty campaign dealing with the impact of modern conflicts at home, introduced large open maps, added weight and heft to its gunplay, and mastered features like Gunsmith, where players built and saved detailed weapon blueprints. MW 2019 had a sandbox-style Ground War mode and also fast competitive modes like Gunfight. The first year of MW 2019 was extremely well planned as a live service game, with the free-to-play battle-royale Warzone launching and hosting memorable events such as The Haunting of Verdansk, a series of mysteries that led up to a rocket launch and even included zombies.\u00a0\nIn this video, David and Aaron talk about how MW 2019 was so different from classic Call of Duty games and why that matters. We\u2019ll dig into the campaign and how it put players into scary situations, in some cases with only a few enemies in a level, such as with the well-known Clean House (London) mission. We\u2019ll go over a few places where the campaign did cross the line. We\u2019re also talking about multiplayer and how Infinity Ward's maps are clever at all sizes, as well as the genius of the Warzone map being made up of core maps so that players were already familiar with it when it launched. We go over how the sandbox gave players a lot of tools and then set them free to try things such as using thermal scopes to see through smoke and using Javelin launchers to hit out-of-reach snipers. This game came out at the perfect time to appeal to lapsed Battlefield players and mil-sim fans, although it wasn\u2019t a great fit for all Call of Duty players. Fans of Sledgehammer and Treyarch\u2019s styles grew frustrated with a departure from the three-lane map design, ability to camp, and slower movement. Some fans rebelled when Modern Warfare's beta didn\u2019t include an always-on mini-map, causing Infinity Ward to put it back into the game.\u00a0\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on October 28, 2022 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC. We got a hands-on preview of the game, so head on over to youtube.com/gamespot and watch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Preview - Bigger, Smaller, & Less Controversial.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTFG2nBda0", "date_published": "2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course DLC Review", "description": "Cuphead and Mugman are back! This time in the form of a new astral partner, The Legendary Chalice, now as Ms. Chalice thanks to the Astral Cookie in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course.\n\nJoin Cuphead, Mugman, and Ms. Chalice as they quest to help Chef Saltbaker collect ingredients to create a permanent solution for Ms. Chalice through defeating a brand new isle of baddies.

The level of detail on display in the DLC\u2019s handful of boss fights is simply mind boggling. More than just visually impressive, though, the new boss fights are more exciting, dynamic, and mechanically diverse. Coupled with a creative new playable character in Ms. Chalice and multiple interesting new weapons/charms, The Delicious Last Course is a triumph that both expands on the base game in clever ways while also improving the original campaign itself.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jhOVk5dA8M", "date_published": "2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sign Up To Playtest The New Skate Game | GameSpot News", "description": "Skate shows off new footage and is opening up sign ups for a playtest, Nerf is making an IRL Gjallarhorn, and the Samsung Gaming Hub is no live.\n\nSkate has an update, the Gjallarhorn is getting a different kind of nerf, and Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub is live! All this on today\u2019s GameSpot News.\n\nThe team behind the new Skate released a fun update video to announce an upcoming playtest. The video claims to feature pre-pre-pre-alpha footage, initially showing off very bare bones levels and character builds, which get into a ton of accidents, before transitioning into gameplay resembling something you would expect to play at home. All the while talking about how the team is implementing a lot of fan ideas into the game, highlighting some of the creative designs that seem ripped from a potential level builder, indicating that Skate 3\u2019s Skate. Park mode could be returning for the new installment.\n\nIt\u2019s been twelve years since that third entry\u2019s release, and after fans champed at the bit for a fourth Skate, EA finally answered their prayers at its 2020 EA Play showcase. Today\u2019s video is the first real update since that announcement, and anyone that wants to help shape the game can sign up to be considered for playtesting at skate.game/insider.\n\nDestiny 2 players that have acquired one of the game\u2019s most iconic weapons, the Gjallarhorn rocket launcher, will have first dibs on a nerfed version of the weapon. No, not a less powerful, in-game Gjallarhorn. An IRL Gjallahorn Nerf blaster! An early access preorder window, starting July 7 and ending July 21, will be available to anyone that has acquired the exotic weapon via the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack, with remaining units available to the public after the fact, the rest of you get Chatterwhite I guess. Head to GameSpot.com for a guide on how to acquire the in-game weapon to get ready for the preorder window.\n\nThis isn\u2019t some toy for small children. The Nerf Gjallarhorn is 4 feet long, meaning it\u2019s a 1:1 replica of the one in-game. All of this awesomeness does come at a price, however, retailing for $185. Inflation has come for Nerf too, it seems.\n\nAfter spending all that money on the Nerf Gjallarhorn, you might not have much of a budget left for games or consoles in July. However, if you have a recent Samsung TV and a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, then you\u2019re in luck! No need to buy games to play or a console to play them on, as Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub is now live. Connect any bluetooth controller to a 2022 Samsung TV, and you\u2019ll be able to access the Xbox Game Pass library via cloud streaming, as well as other similar services like Google Stadia and GeForce Now, with Amazon Luna support coming soon.\n\nThis is just one step for Xbox bringing cloud gaming to the TV. In June 2021, Xbox confirmed it was working on a device akin to an Amazon Fire TV Stick. Codenamed \u201cKeystone\u201d, a reference to the ancient relic from the Halo franchise, the device would bring Xbox cloud streaming to other television models, even ones that don\u2019t have Smart TV functionality. Windows Central confirmed this May with the company that they are taking a little longer than initially planned to bring the product to market, but when it does become available to consumers, theoretically any TV should be able to support Xbox cloud gaming.\n\nThat\u2019s everything on today\u2019s GameSpot News!
