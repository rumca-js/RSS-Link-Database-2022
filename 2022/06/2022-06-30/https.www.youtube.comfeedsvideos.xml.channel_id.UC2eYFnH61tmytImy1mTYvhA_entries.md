(NOTE: I released this video on my PeerTube instance (https://videos.lukesmith.xyz) a while ago and realized I forgot to upload it to YouTube, so here it is, and still relevant).

After some annoyances, I decided to make my life easier by switching Based.Cooking over to using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go which has tagging abilities and other niceties. Not only has it made the site easier to maintain, but I've added some other perks like a simple Javascript list filter and I've enjoyed Hugo so much I switched by personal website (https://lukesmith.xyz) over to it as well.

If you want to contribute a recipe, or improve a preexisting one, including adding an image, you can do it at the Github repository for the site: https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/based.cooking
