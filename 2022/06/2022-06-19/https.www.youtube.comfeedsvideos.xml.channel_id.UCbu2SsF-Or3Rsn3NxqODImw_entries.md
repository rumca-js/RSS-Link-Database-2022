Jack Humbert has fulfilled my dreams and created a mod called “Let There Be Flight” that lets players fly cars and bikes around Night City. And these aren’t your standard GTA cheat code looking flying cars, this mod has an animation for the wheels that turns them into thrusters.

A frontline tank, Junker Queen is all about getting up close and personal and dealing damage with her battle ax and scattergun shotgun. Melee attacks with the ax, as well as hits with her Carnage ability or ultimate ability, Rampage, will inflict wounds on enemies. Junker Queen will be playable in the second round of the Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28.

Call of Duty Season 4 is being dubbed Mercenaries of Fortune and sees now-feuding operators from Vanguard battling over gold. The updates will be available to download at 9 AM PT / 12 PM PT on June 21 for Vanguard and 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on June 22 for Warzone.

Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is the first ever CRPG set in the Grimdark of the 41st millenia, with that comes the opportunity to explore parts of the Warhammer franchise that no other game has touched on. What is there in 40k beyond war? How will characters and player choices play a part in roleplay and exploration?
Our own Warhammer nerd Dave Jewitt caught up with Owlcat's Alexander Gusev to find out a little more about Rogue Trader, and asks what a game like this means for Warhammer games as a whole.
