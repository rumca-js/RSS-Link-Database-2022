And I realised that, yes, I had a question to answer: and it all goes back to an old kids' television show called \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\"...\n\nThis isn't an advert for Sparkmate. I've not been paid, and they had no control over the edit, the story, or whether it was published at all. However, they've obviously given a large amount of time, money and effort to put this together, and hopefully that's clear from the video!\n\nThey're also hiring: https://Spkm.co/JoinTheSpark\nAnd on Instagram: https://Spkm.co/Insta\n\nEdited by Isla McTear\n\nCaptain Scarlet and the Mysterons is a Century 21 Television / ITC Entertainment production, and the full series is available on Blu-Ray here: https://amzn.to/3OlIZgp (that's an affiliate link)\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSmtKMx1CB4", "date_published": "2022-06-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
