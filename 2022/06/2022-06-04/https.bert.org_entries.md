When I was growing up in the 90s, I remember wanting to get on the Internet. My parents werenâ€™t going to help me, so I called up an ISP and said I wanted to set up an account. They asked for my name and I gave them a fake name. And then they asked for a credit card number and I told them I had to find my wallet and call them back.
