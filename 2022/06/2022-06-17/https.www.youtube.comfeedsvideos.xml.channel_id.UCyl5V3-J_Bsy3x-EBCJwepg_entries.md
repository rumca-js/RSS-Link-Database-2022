Kyle and Adam welcome Joel Berry to the brand new podcast studio. It has a neon light and everything! The trio discuss gun control, sentient AI, and more! We've also got some more Bee Radio and Weakly News coming at you. And Travis hops in to quiz Kyle and Joel on their new book, The Postmodern Pilgrim’s Progress.

We also take the time to interview Penny Nance to find out how many Pennies her thoughts cost. (It's three)

Be sure to look into Concerned Women For America and their work: https://concernedwomen.org/

Subscribers, stick around for hate mail, subscriber headlines, and a dramatic discussion on which dinosaur is Joel’s favorite. The answer may shock you!
