Obi Wan Kenobi: "Hello There"

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. The @NovationTV Circuit Tracks is the brain and sequencer. The opening arp is the Circuit's internal Synth 1. The bass is using internal Synth 2. The drums use Drum Tracks 1-3 (kick, snare, hats) and Drum Track 4 is used for the vocal sample. The 2 MIDI tracks are being used to control the @ArturiaOfficial Microfreak and the @rolandglobal JU-06. I use Scenes on the Circuit to go from one section to another, or to 'mute' tracks (it's a workaround - to mute, I use a blank pattern)
The percussion is a @KorgOfficial Wavedrum Global, using an edited Tabla preset.
For guitars I use a Joyo American Sound for amp and @tcelectronic Echobrain for delay.
For looping the tabla I use a @SingularSoundOfficial Aeros Loop Studio, with a @DisasterAreaDesigns Midi Baby on the floor to trigger a loop record and to trigger playbank when the loop recording is done.
Recorded as stereo (Circuit) and multitracks (guitar loop and solo) into a Zoom H5 and mastered in Logic Pro X (some eq and reverb and compression).
