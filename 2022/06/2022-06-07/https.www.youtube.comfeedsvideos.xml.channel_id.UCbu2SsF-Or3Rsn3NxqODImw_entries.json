Today we\u2019re going to go over the briefing and can talk about hands-on impressions at a future date. We\u2019ll have a larger written preview by Summer Doster that goes into even more granular detail. Modern Warfare 2 releases on October 28, with an open beta before launch. Infinity Ward paid for GameSpot to attend this preview event.\u00a0Also please note that all gameplay in this video is from older Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare (2019) and Cold War.\n\nModern Warfare 2 has both bigger and smaller multiplayer modes, with a campaign focused on reliving the greatest hits, like All Ghillied Up, using new twists. Ground War is now just one part of the Battle Maps mode. That means more purpose-built maps that are very much for mil-sim Call Of Duty players who loved the larger open-level design of Modern Warfare 2019. \n\nCore multiplayer, from what we saw, consists of smaller and more straightforward 6v6 competitive modes, like Knockout and Prisoner Rescue, that will appeal to more classic fast-paced Cold War fans in both map design and aesthetics. We know there will be a Spec-Ops mode, but we didn\u2019t hear any details about it, except it will lean more towards the linear scenarios of the original MW2. When it comes to Warzone, we finally got an answer, and yes, the next Warzone will be a clean start coming soon after Modern Warfare 2's launch. It is separate from the current version of Warzone. In general, weapon customization seems as robust as in MW 2019, with categories of weapons that evolve into other roles as you go through the unlock tree. Perks are now grouped into packages, where you pick two to start with and earn the rest during a match, similar to MW 2019\u2019s specialist option in multiplayer.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest tech focus in Modern Warfare 2 is water as a movement and escape mechanic. Players can dive and swim into bodies of water, with the water becoming murkier the deeper you go. Ballistics are also impacted by water. Equipment will keep up the sandbox design of Modern Warfare 2019 with things like Cameras, Drill Charges, and Inflatable Dummies. Much of the gear also has alternate water modes. Movement both on foot and in vehicles has been improved. Vehicles, in particular, can now have bumpers ripped off or tires blown out and players, even drivers, can lean out or jump on the roofs of vehicles while they're moving.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKVRrHDpsb8", "date_published": "2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II - Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "Check out the worldwide reveal for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

The leak comes from Tom Henderson for Try Hard Guides, who claim to have seen \"early footage\" of Overdose which shows actress Margaret Qualley in a blue dress. It's no secret that Kojima is working on something, but whether or not it's a new horror game or Death Stranding 2 is unofficial.\n\nKojima's plans for Silent Hill may be lost, but the Silent Hill franchise continues to live on in the rumor mill. Horror-centric developers Bloober Team, makers of Layers of Fear, Blair Witch, and The Medium, has released a teaser for a new project, one that alludes to a new Layers of Fear - after all, it was posted from the Layers of Fear 2 official Twitter account. However, that teaser comes amidst ongoing rumors that Bloober Team may also be working on a Silent Hill game in collaboration with Konami.\u00a0\n\nXbox head Phil Spencer was caught playing Banjo-Kazooie recently, and the result has fans thinking it's a tease for an upcoming announcement of a new Banjo-Kazooie. According to Phil Spencer's Xbox activity, which can be tracked using xboxgamertag.com, P3, or Phil Spencer, showed he was playing the classic platformer just five days ago for a total of 37 minutes - just enough time to unlock a single achievement. However, he hasn't touched it since then. Instead he's been busy with the Elden Ring and Ninja Gaiden. Maybe Banjo-Kazooie wasn't hard enough for him. Still, the rumor mill has swirled regardless.\n\nBattlefield 2042 Hands-On Preview: https://youtu.be/xeaZf2ew-bM\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:11 - Kojima Horror Game Leaked\n01:41 - Layer of Fear Dev Tease New Game\n02:51 - Phil Spencer Plays Banjo Kazooie, Fans Start To Speculate\n04:12 - Battlefield 2042 Season One Preview Coverage\n04:26 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRufbGkHdxs", "date_published": "2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Stray Preview", "description": "Jordan Ram\u00e9e had the chance to attend a preview of Stray.

That session put us on Exposure, the new map coming to Battlefield 2042 available to all players. Exposure feels like it sets a different tone from some of BF 2042's other maps, with a host of differing locations and a focus on verticality that goes beyond what we've previously seen in the game.\n\nWe played both Breakthrough and Conquest on Exposure, with the former mode using a smaller portion of the map and confining its player count to 64. The smaller Breakthrough approach is reflective of one of BF 2042's biggest changes going forward. DICE is \"unshackling\" its All-Out Warfare modes from its previous 128-player count, and will instead be focusing on somewhat smaller maps with more cover and density with seasonal releases going forward. You'll still find 128-player modes on original launch maps and Exposure offers 128-player Conquest, but starting in Season 2, new maps will stop supporting 128-player modes and top out at 64 players.\n\nDICE is adding a new specialist character in Season 1: anti-vehicle engineer Lis. The character is especially good at taking down airborn threats, it seems, with Lis sporting a tele-guided missile launcher--which means you control the missile and fly it into your target. Helicopters might sport radar-breaking stealth, but if you're using Lis, you can use her launcher to bypass the need for any smart tracking and do the aiming yourself.\n\nAdding some new variety for the rest of Season 1 are two new weapons and a new gadget to help spice up some loadouts. DICE is adding a new designated marksman rifle called the BSV-M, which is like having a sniper rifle that can also handle close combat. The gun comes with an integrated suppressor, to keep the noise down and make you tougher for enemies to find as you fight, along with single-fire and fully automatic firing modes. Even more fun than the BSV-M, though, is the new Ghostmaker Crossbow. The single-firing bow has a surprisingly long range, keeping it effective at a variety of distances, and it's nearly silent. At closer ranges, it'll generally earn you a one-hit kill--provided you actually hit what you're shooting at. Miss, and you'll suffer through a painfully long reload animation that leaves you extremely open to getting blasted by any faster-firing weapon. But if you land the hit, the crossbow is incredibly satisfying, and can even be effective at longer ranges, even though you'll have to land two or three shots to win a fight.\n\n#BF2042 #battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeaZf2ew-bM", "date_published": "2022-06-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battlefield 2042 Zero Hour Season 1 Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Check out Battlefield 2042's first season Zero Hour in this latest gameplay trailer.
