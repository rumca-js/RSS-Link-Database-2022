Sorry, this post will read like a “dear diary” entry rather than some life-changing HN-worthy guidance. Back in November 2020, almost on a whim I started work on a new parser for the Ruby programming language. It was almost exactly a year after I had started working on my compiler project (I hope to write a longer post about that someday soon), and in my frustration with the state of affairs with Ruby parsers available to a humble C/C++ programmer, I decided to see how hard it would be.
