The multiplatform investigation tells the stories of lives cut short, and examines a federal effort to grapple with America\u2019s legacy of racist killings through the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.\nVisit www.frontline.org/unresolved to experience the award-winning Un(re)solved project yourself.

Shogaolu rooted the visuals of Un(re)solved in the powerful symbolism of trees. \u201cI was really inspired by looking at the role of the tree as a symbol in American history,\u201d Shogaolu said. \u201cIt\u2019s been looked at as a symbol of freedom, we look at it as a connector between generations, and also there\u2019s the association of trees with racial terror.\u201d By turning the forests depicted throughout Un(re)solved into beautiful spaces, the artists sought to reclaim them for African Americans and to honor the victims.\nShogaolu was also inspired by the African American tradition of quilting. Among enslaved African Americans forbidden to read or write, quilts provided an important space to document family stories. Today, quilting remains a creative outlet rich with story and tradition. The artwork in Un(re)solved weaves in textures, motifs and patterns to create a quilt that the stories live within.\nIn the interactive, the stories are brought to life in part through impressionistic animations rooted in archival source materials. Shogaolu says this is a technique she uses in her artwork to help audiences remember that both the people and events in her stories are real. For Un(re)solved, the archival photos are transformed into colorful illustrations, given texture and layered with other imagery. For black and white images when colors were known, the artists tried to fairly represent them.\nSubscribe on YouTube:\nhttp://bit.ly/1BycsJW\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nhttps://www.instagram.com/un_re_solved/\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.
