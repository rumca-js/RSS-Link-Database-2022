This is a re-presentation of the talk that I did at Monerotopia. The native recording (which you can see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVpeZMLaliE) was suboptimal in quality and part of it was missing, so I'm going through the whole thing with EXTENDED HECKIN' COMMENTARY here.

This was released first on my personal video site. See it here:

I've been using shadowchat (https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/shadowchat) for a while to receive donations with messages (superchats) with Monero. It's just a simple program written in Go and doesn't need anything else too fancy to work.

It also works with OBS and shows notifications and sends notification emails if you want that as well.
