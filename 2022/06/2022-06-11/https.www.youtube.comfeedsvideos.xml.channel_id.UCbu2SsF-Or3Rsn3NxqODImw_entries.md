We got some hands on time with Escape Academy, and upcoming Room Escape game created by former Escape Room designers. After the lockdown, the designers wanted to keep making escape rooms, and found themselves delving into digital escape games. Dave and Jordan were able to co-op and solve the puzzles to give their first impressions of the game.

While Room Escape games have existed ever since the advent of Flash, with games like Crimson Room starting the trend, we haven't seen physical escape room designers attempt a digital escape room like this before. The game is built with co-op in mind, just like real life escape rooms, meaning their are plenty of puzzles that are built with the idea of playing with friends. The puzzle types vary through-out rooms, and there are often timers giving players a sense of urgency. Jordan and Dave discuss their utter joy at where the game seems to be heading.

Capcom's Street Fighter 6 is one of the biggest games of Summer Game Feast and the PlayStation 5 version of the fighting game was playable at the show.

GameSpot’s resident fighting game fan got hands-on time with the game, putting the Drive system through its passes to find out how mechanically dense the latest entry in the stories fighting game franchise is, and how it feels. In this video you'll see Ryu, Chun-li, Luke, and newcomer Jamie battle it out for supremacy.

You'll also get a good look at how the various parry and reversal systems work, as well as how the cinematic Critical Arts will bring some bombast to the brawls.

We get to try out the new drive system. With the Drive Gauge you are able to perform five different techniques that can enhance your offense or defense. One of the five is the Drive Impact which is a powerful strike that can absorb an opponent’s incoming attack and can lead to a wall splat. Whereas you can use Drive Parry to repel your opponent’s attack and refill your Drive Gauge. Additionally, you can cancel your Drive Parry or normal attack into a Drive Rush to quickly close in on your opponent and also play mind games. Overdrive Arts are similar to EX Moves from previous Street Fighter games that enhance your Special Moves. Finally the fifth option in the new Drive System, is Drive Reversal which allows you to perform a counterattack to get you out of sticky situations. This new drive system gives players a lot of flexibility and creativity to best their opponents in Street Fighter 6.

Street Fighter 6 is coming out in 2023!
