Here's everything you need to know about Mario's latest adventure\n\nMario Strikers: Battle League isn\u2019t exactly the newest FIFA game. Instead, it takes the iconic plumber, and many of his most popular friends and rivals and has them duke it out on the soccer pitch. This video breaks down everything you need to know ahead of the upcoming release of Mario Strikers: Battle League on June 10th.\n\nThe game adds a fun arcadey twist to the game of soccer by eliminating all fouls. This means characters will violently and hilariously tackle each other, all in the name of sportsmanship. Don\u2019t worry if you get beat up since getting tackled is one way you will receive items similar to those you might find in a Mario Party or Mario Kart game, letting you even the odds a bit.\n\nLastly, you can take an awesome final smash style shot where the game will add really cool animations as your character levels an unblockable shot if you time the shot perfectly. Don\u2019t worry if you miss the window, though, as you\u2019ll still have a good chance at making a goal, although if you\u2019re unlucky, the ball might land in the goalie\u2019s hands. Mario Strikers: Battle League comes out exclusively on Nintendo Switch. See you on the pitch!\n\n#MarioStrikers #battleleague", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbpV3qAKE-4", "date_published": "2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Netflix Geeked Week - Day 1 Livestream | Series Showcase, The Sandman & The Umbrella Academy", "description": "It's Netflix's Geeked Week, a celebration and showcase of all things geeked coming from Netflix.

When you\u2019re not browsing its flora, swim beneath its waterfalls, seek loot in its cavern, and spring from its geysers. \n\nBallers are back! Roll around and grapple onto surfaces, but don\u2019t just roll as you did before. In the spirit of celebration, get on the (totally safe) Screwballer for a high-flying amusement park ride. \n\nDon\u2019t let the high-speed fun stop with Ballers: jump on a wolf or boar to ride on it! You don\u2019t have to dismount to fight \u2014 shoot and throw weapons while atop your steed.\n\nReality Seed Pods are spreading from the Reality Tree. Plant a Reality Seed to grow a Reality Sapling \u2014 which grows in the same place match to match! Saplings bear better loot each time you weed them, so keep weeding a sapling until it bears Mythic loot. When it wilts away, plant the seed left behind!\n\nBring good and evil together with this Season\u2019s Battle Pass.
