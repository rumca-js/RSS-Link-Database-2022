In 2004, I was a senior majoring in Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University. The tech industry hadn’t yet fully recovered from the bubble bursting, so programming jobs were pretty hard to come by. I was applying for jobs everywhere, but just couldn’t seem to get an interview. One day, I saw a flyer pinned to the mostly empty job board in the Computer Science department. It said that Microsoft would be coming to the campus for a job fair.
