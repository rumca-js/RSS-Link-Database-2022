It’s Summer Game Fest time. Xbox Showcase, Geoff’s Show, whatever. It’s here. Modern Warfare 2 will be there. Probably other stuff.

Today I’m gonna go through some of my thoughts and predictions because, why not. You could also ask “why”, but that’s a bit existential for my taste.

So yeah, I’ll talk about starfield, redfall, halo, halo 2, mass effect, skate, ps5s and xbox series x2s: x-men unite, and just…yeah. It’s a predictions video. You get the point.
