Xbox Showcase, Geoff\u2019s Show, whatever. It\u2019s here. Modern Warfare 2 will be there. Probably other stuff.\n\nToday I\u2019m gonna go through some of my thoughts and predictions because, why not. You could also ask \u201cwhy\u201d, but that\u2019s a bit existential for my taste.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019ll talk about starfield, redfall, halo, halo 2, mass effect, skate, ps5s and xbox series x2s: x-men unite, and just\u2026yeah.
