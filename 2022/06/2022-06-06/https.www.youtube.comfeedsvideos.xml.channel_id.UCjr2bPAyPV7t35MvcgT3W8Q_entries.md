I needed to anonymize my phone. This how I did it.

I can’t trust anyone with my data. When I use a phone with a Google Account or Apple ID, these companies are by default going to be collect unique hardware identifiers, my location information and app usage data without possibility to opt out. 

If I want to use a phone I need to choose one that is going to allow me to use it completely anonymously and let me be in control of all of my data. I want to a phone that maintains Android’s security model and keeps the best security practices for security updates.

GrapheneOS has a far-reaching number of substantial improvements that altogether make up for the most secure mobile operating system for the end user. 

Because I want to keep this device as anonymous as possible, I do not even insert a SIM card at all and use the phone as a WiFi-only device. To protect my IP address, I use Orbot to route my traffic through Tor.
