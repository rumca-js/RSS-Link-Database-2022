Advanced privacy is a feature that lets you hide your IP address, provide a fake location, and denies all trackers. It will show you a graph of all blocked trackers, and you can manage these per app.\n\nInstead of the Google Play Store, you get the App Lounge. It allows you to login anonymously, or using a Google Account, to let you buy paid apps.\n\nI downloaded a bunch of apps, including my banking app, Twitter, Firefox, Youtube, Game Pass, Freeletics, or Youtube music, and they all worked flawlessly, as you'd expect.\n\nThe App Lounge still retains its privacy ratings, giving a score out of 10 for each app, powered by Exodus Privacy.\n\nIn terms of internals, /e/ OS is still based on Lineage 18.1, so it's on Android 11, but it does have all the latest security patches, and gets updated regularly.\n\nI'm less excited about the FairPhone 4. While is absolutely love the mission behind this phone, it doesn't feel like a device that suits my needs.\n\nFirst, it's pretty heavy, at 228 grams. But it doesn't have high refresh rate, and after using a phone and a tablet, and a PC screen that run at least at 100hz, the return to 60hz is brutal\n\nIt uses a snapdragon 750G with 5G support, it has 6 to 8GB of RAM depending on the storage, either 128GB or 256GB. The battery is 3900 mAh, and definitely lasts the whole day without any problems.\n\nThe cameras are pretty good, with dual 48MP on the back at F1.6 and F2.2 aperture, so you get a wide angle, and the selfie camera is 25MP at F2.2, with a small notch.\n\nThe phone itself comes in grey, green, or speckled green, I got the gray variant, and you can add a charger and cable optionally, if you don't already have them.\n\nThe price is pretty high too for these specs, at 579\u20ac, but that's the price you pay for a sustainable phone with a huge warranty and repairability. You also get a fingerprint reader\n\nWhat if you don't want a fairphone but you like /e/ OS? Well, you can do that as well, after all I used it on a galaxy S8+ before.\n\nThey have 3 ways to get /e/ OS. First, you have their online store, where they offer a variety of devices, including the Fairphone 3 and 4, Galaxy S nines and S nines +.\n\nSecond, you can use their Easy Installer. Third, if your device isn't supported by the easy installer, you can just flash /e/ OS on a LOT of phones.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNjnMEMWMLY", "date_published": "2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
