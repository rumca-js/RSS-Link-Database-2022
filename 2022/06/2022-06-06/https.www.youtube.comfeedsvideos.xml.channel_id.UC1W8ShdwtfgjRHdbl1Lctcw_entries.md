I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of the river Seine and Avenue du Bois, Shots from elevator ascending, Eiffel Tower in Paris 1920s, 

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
