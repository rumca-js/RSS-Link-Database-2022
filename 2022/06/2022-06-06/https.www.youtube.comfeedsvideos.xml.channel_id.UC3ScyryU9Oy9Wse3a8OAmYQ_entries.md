In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook tragedy, Newtown residents engaged in a debate over guns that could have taken place almost anywhere in America. The issue: Should amateur shooting ranges be subject to inspection and approval by the police chief? On one side were residents concerned about noise and unregulated shooting. On the other, those who see gun rights as an essential American freedom.
