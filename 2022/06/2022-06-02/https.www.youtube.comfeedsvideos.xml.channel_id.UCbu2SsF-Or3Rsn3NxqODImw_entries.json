So close that it's less than a week away on June 8th. In an effort to build up further hype for the game, Activision released a live-action teaser trailer that shows a group of soldiers, Task Force 141, preparing to go behind enemy lines.\n\nValve has announced a delay for the Steam Deck Docking Station release due to a shortage of parts for the peripheral. Luckily, those who have preordered a Steam Deck don't have to worry about the dock's delay impacting any other timelines, as they use parts from different factories.\n\nBattlefield 2042's long-awaited Season 1 update will be revealed officially next week. The reveal could happen--possibly with an accompanying trailer--on June 7, with impressions from media and other sources going live on June 8. \n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:08 - Steam Deck\n01:25 - Battlefield 2042\n02:34 - Dragon Age", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Th2a5DEaSU", "date_published": "2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake & Village May Be Connected | GameSpot News", "description": "Resident Evil 4 Remake might be connected to RE Village, Street Fight 6 has brand new gameplay mechanics and Sony is increasing PS5 production.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #RE4 #PS5\n\nThe June 3 PlayStation State of Play presentation had far more exciting content than we expected, including a number of upcoming PS5 and PSVR 2 games. It even included an unexpected PC announcement for Spider-Man and a remake of one of the most beloved Resident Evil games - Resident Evil 4. Talk about a very strong opener!\n\nReddit user Kaiju Media James pointed out a possible link between the two games. Kaiju wrote, \u201cI noticed this symbol in the RE4R trailer, it looks somewhat similar to the Four Houses symbol in Village. Another user, lejitness, compared an image of Saddler from the new RE4 to one of Village\u2019s Mother Miranda.

But somewhere early in its making, a small decision was made that collided with that basic principle, and sent its development into a cascading spiral of problems.\u00a0\n\nAt the heart of an unforgettable Dungeons & Dragons campaign is a great dungeon master. It's their responsibility to guide the player on an adventure and make sure the world reacts to their actions in a way that feels natural and unplanned.\u00a0\n\nFor developer Larian Studios, to capture that D&D essence in Baldur's Gate 3, it has to evoke that same sense of freedom and role playing. It's collaborative storytelling between the player and the story. Every choice, action, reaction, and consequence has to feel like it really matters, no matter how big or small.\n\nBut somewhere early in the making of Baldur's Gate 3, the game's dungeon master, Swen Vincke, made a small decision that sent its development into a cascading spiral of problems that has been a big challenge to solve. And all it involved was getting the player to acquire one very specific item: the Mysterious Artefact and it belongs to a character named Shadowheart. In an effort to get the player to receive this item as elegantly and naturally as possible, as though it was their own decision, has resulted in creating 100s of possibilities that plagued the game's development.\n\nThis is the story of how the Mysterious Artefact broke Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nBe sure to check out The Bee That Broke Skyrim: https://youtu.be/Ll6M5QiIa6k\n\nAnd The Aiming System That Broke Weird West: https://youtu.be/mf2gyaXd4LA\n\n#BaldursGate3 #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHW_KFP7i8I", "date_published": "2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best PlayStation State of Play Trailers (June 2022)", "description": "Check out the best trailers from the latest PlayStation State of Play.
