The young Houstonian and Blue Note recording artist begins with the hypnotic grooves of \u201c713\u201d \u2014 one of our picks for the best songs of 2021. This tune allows Francies\u2019 virtuosic playing to shine, as he masterfully scales the keys during his solo. After a quick greeting, we\u2019re whisked away by the luscious string ensemble that introduces \u201cRose Water.\u201d Performed by vocalist Elliott Skinner, we\u2019re lifted by Skinner\u2019s voice as he sings beautifully of hope, support and growth: \u201cI wish that you could see the light / That radiates in everyday\u2026All the trials inside my mind / Shape me.\u201d \n\nFrancies ends his set with \u201cSway/Freedmen\u2019s Town.\u201d The jazz trio plays while a recording of the voice of Francies\u2019 father, James Francies Sr., tells the story of Freedmen\u2019s Town, a historic district of Houston now known as Fourth Ward. It\u2019s a fitting end to a Tiny Desk (home) concert that celebrates Black Music Month, a poignant and powerful reminder of how far we have come and what we still struggle against. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201c713\u201d\n\u201cRose Water\u201d\n\u201cSway/Freedmen\u2019s Town\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJames Francies: piano\nJeremy Dutton: drums\nOr Bareket: bass\nElliott Skinner: vocals \nFrancesca Dardani: violin\nAdriana Molello: violin\nTia Allen: viola\nMarta Bagratuni: cello\n\nCREDITS\nVideo by: Andy Schwartz, Andy Poland, Tripp Kramer  \nAudio By: Gosha Usov, Jason Rostkowski   \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O\u2019Neill\nVideo Producer: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAnimator: Kaz Fantone\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskconcert #jamesfrancies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVskXNb2PIM", "date_published": "2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Adekunle Gold: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts \u2014 both from home and from behind our beloved Desk.

The shape of the Nigerian singer-songwriter's Tiny Desk (home) concert mimics a flight pattern sonically and energetically, starting off laid back and ascending to greater heights that'll make you dance and move your feet.\n\nAG's career first picked up steam after the release of his debut single \"Sade,\" a highlife cover of One Direction's \"Story of My Life,\" in 2014; then, he released his debut album Gold in 2016. Three albums later, the Yoruba sensation's sound has evolved from highlife to Afropop.\n\nAG filmed his (home) concert with his band in Los Angeles, inside a retro, faux airport terminal \u2013 home of AG Baby Airlines. Opening with \"Sinner,\" a modern take on the Biblical story of King David and Bathsheba, the band's arrangement translates seamlessly live, with AG's smooth vocals complimented by violin and driven by steady, rhythmic drums.\n\nClosing his set with the uptempo and jaunty \"Okay,\" a reliable banger from his record Afro Pop, Vol. 1, AG explains: \"It's such an energy giver \u2014 the people turn up, and we are about to turn up now.\" Embarking on his first North American Tour Catch Me If You Can, which has its first stop today in Boston \u2014 as noted on the AG Baby Airlines signage \u2014 \"turn up\" is precisely the correct term as AG Baby is letting you know that he may be bringing his signature soulful Afropop to a city near you.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sinner\"\n\"Something Different\"\n\"One Woman\"\n\"Okay\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAdekunle Gold: vocals\nOmar Perrin: keys/MD\nCam Griffin: guitar\nDarius Woodley: drums\nClark Sims: bass\nLulu V: violin\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Robin Burke\nProducer: Kristene Lew, Kat Boyd\nCreative Director: Grace Hsiu\nProducer: 1983 Creative\nDirector of Photography: Mikey Van Beuren\nCamera Operators: Danny Corey, Kyle Messina\n1st AC: Dima Shorin, Garrett Hoffmann\n2nd AC: Natasha Abdul\nEditors: Wolf De Burgo, Cole Benton\nGaffer: Adam Schaffer\nElectric: Wesley Aharoni\nKey Grip: Ryan Silver\nAudio Engineer: Liz Robson\nAssistant Engineer: Anthony Culpepper\nMix Engineer: Bakare Michael\nMix and Master Engineer: Mike Tucci \nTruck PA: Herbie Finn Bailey De Vos\nSet PA: Patrick Amirbehboody\nManagement: Elizabeth Sobowale, Ola Fowosere\nExtra: Tyler Lazalere, Zo\u00eb Montano, Dionte Goodlett\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Andie Huether\nAnimation: Kaz Fantone\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Josh Rogosin, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskconcert #adekunlegold", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-gkSte4QdA", "date_published": "2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
