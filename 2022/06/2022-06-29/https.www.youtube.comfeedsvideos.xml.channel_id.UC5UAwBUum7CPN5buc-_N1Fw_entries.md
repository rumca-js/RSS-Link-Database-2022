June 28

Krita 5.1 looks like it's going to be a very good release for users of the digital painting tool.

Endless OS, a linux distribution aiming at the education market, posted a nice blog post about how they collaborate with GNOME to make both Endless OS

Let's conclude this with some big Steam Deck news! First, people who are still waiting for their devices are probably going to get them quite fast, now, as Valve announced they'd be shipping double the number of Decks each week than they previously did.

The Deck also got a client update, and the Deck passed another milestone, with 3600 games now certified to be playable
