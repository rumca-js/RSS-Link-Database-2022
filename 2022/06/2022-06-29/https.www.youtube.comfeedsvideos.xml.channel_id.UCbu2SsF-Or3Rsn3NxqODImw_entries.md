Cuphead and Mugman are back! This time in the form of a new astral partner, The Legendary Chalice, now as Ms. Chalice thanks to the Astral Cookie in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course.

Join Cuphead, Mugman, and Ms. Chalice as they quest to help Chef Saltbaker collect ingredients to create a permanent solution for Ms. Chalice through defeating a brand new isle of baddies. Expect more chaotic run and gun boss fights with Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, which releases today, June 30th, to PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PS4.

Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course was worth the wait. The level of detail on display in the DLC’s handful of boss fights is simply mind boggling. More than just visually impressive, though, the new boss fights are more exciting, dynamic, and mechanically diverse. Coupled with a creative new playable character in Ms. Chalice and multiple interesting new weapons/charms, The Delicious Last Course is a triumph that both expands on the base game in clever ways while also improving the original campaign itself.

Skate shows off new footage and is opening up sign ups for a playtest, Nerf is making an IRL Gjallarhorn, and the Samsung Gaming Hub is no live.

Skate has an update, the Gjallarhorn is getting a different kind of nerf, and Samsung’s Gaming Hub is live! All this on today’s GameSpot News.

The team behind the new Skate released a fun update video to announce an upcoming playtest. The video claims to feature pre-pre-pre-alpha footage, initially showing off very bare bones levels and character builds, which get into a ton of accidents, before transitioning into gameplay resembling something you would expect to play at home. All the while talking about how the team is implementing a lot of fan ideas into the game, highlighting some of the creative designs that seem ripped from a potential level builder, indicating that Skate 3’s Skate. Park mode could be returning for the new installment.

It’s been twelve years since that third entry’s release, and after fans champed at the bit for a fourth Skate, EA finally answered their prayers at its 2020 EA Play showcase. Today’s video is the first real update since that announcement, and anyone that wants to help shape the game can sign up to be considered for playtesting at skate.game/insider.

Destiny 2 players that have acquired one of the game’s most iconic weapons, the Gjallarhorn rocket launcher, will have first dibs on a nerfed version of the weapon. No, not a less powerful, in-game Gjallarhorn. An IRL Gjallahorn Nerf blaster! An early access preorder window, starting July 7 and ending July 21, will be available to anyone that has acquired the exotic weapon via the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack, with remaining units available to the public after the fact, the rest of you get Chatterwhite I guess. Head to GameSpot.com for a guide on how to acquire the in-game weapon to get ready for the preorder window.

This isn’t some toy for small children. The Nerf Gjallarhorn is 4 feet long, meaning it’s a 1:1 replica of the one in-game. All of this awesomeness does come at a price, however, retailing for $185. Inflation has come for Nerf too, it seems.

After spending all that money on the Nerf Gjallarhorn, you might not have much of a budget left for games or consoles in July. However, if you have a recent Samsung TV and a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, then you’re in luck! No need to buy games to play or a console to play them on, as Samsung’s Gaming Hub is now live. Connect any bluetooth controller to a 2022 Samsung TV, and you’ll be able to access the Xbox Game Pass library via cloud streaming, as well as other similar services like Google Stadia and GeForce Now, with Amazon Luna support coming soon.

This is just one step for Xbox bringing cloud gaming to the TV. In June 2021, Xbox confirmed it was working on a device akin to an Amazon Fire TV Stick. Codenamed “Keystone”, a reference to the ancient relic from the Halo franchise, the device would bring Xbox cloud streaming to other television models, even ones that don’t have Smart TV functionality. Windows Central confirmed this May with the company that they are taking a little longer than initially planned to bring the product to market, but when it does become available to consumers, theoretically any TV should be able to support Xbox cloud gaming.

That’s everything on today’s GameSpot News! Remember to sign up to playtest the new Skate, and head to GameSpot.com for all the details on how to obtain that sick Nerf Gjallahorn early.

## PlayStation Plus Games Revealed Alongside New Gaming Tech From Sony | GameSpot News

July's PlayStation Plus games have been confirmed, Sony unveils its new InZone monitors and headphones, as well as Skull & Bones release date news.

July’s rumored PlayStation Plus games have been confirmed, and the PS5 is getting some exciting new accessories. Plus, an update for Skull and Bones on today’s GameSpot News.

After initially leaking, as PlayStation Plus games are known to do, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan, and Arcadeggedon are confirmed to be your included titles for July on the service.

Subscribers of any tier will now be able to enjoy the entire Bandicoot Saga, the original three games already a part of the PS Plus Collection via the N. Sane Trilogy. Man of Medan is a horror game from developer Supermassive, which recently put out another spooky title The Quarry, and Arcadeggedon is an arena shooter with both PVE and PVP elements. All three titles will be available to download at no additional cost for subscribers on July 5.

That’s not the only thing up Sony’s sleeve! The company also announced that it is releasing a number of gaming accessories as a part of a new gaming brand, InZone. The initial lineup consists of two monitors and three gaming headphones, with both sets of products designed for use with PCs and PlayStation consoles.

The pair of monitors are being dubbed the M9 and M3. The M9 sports a 27” 4K display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Supporting video input via HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and USB-C, the device can connect to a beefy gaming rig, a MacBook Air, or any device in between. And thanks to features like auto HDR tone mapping, this monitor is built to make tinkering with settings on a PlayStation 5 less cumbersome. Later in the year, the more affordable M3 will drop, sporting a lower resolution 1080p display, but increasing the refresh rate to 240Hz. Considering the PS5 only supports up to a 120Hz output, the higher refresh rate really only concerns users looking to connect the monitor to a PC.

The InZone headphone line consists of a wired option, the H3, and two wireless options, the H7 and H9. The differences in the wireless options have mostly to do with active noise cancelation, the H7 lacking support for the feature, but with an increased battery life due to that fact. For more details on both the monitor and headphone lineups, like specific specs and how to get your hands on them, head to GameSpot.com.
