This has been Black magic.\" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.\n\nUsher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.\n\nWhat he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\"\n\"Superstar\"\n\"U Don't Have to Call\"\n\"Nice & Slow\"\n\"Confessions Part II\"\n\"My Way\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nUsher: vocals\nEric Bellinger: vocals\nVedo: vocals\nDmitry Gorodetsky: bass\nLemar Guillary: trombone\nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nJay Flat: saxophone\nDarek Cobbs: keys\nErick Walls: guitar\nRyan Carr: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #usher #BMM", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg", "date_published": "2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Denzel Curry: Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts \u2014 both from home and from behind our beloved Desk.

That\u2019s great for two rehearsals!\u201d \n\nFrom the moment Curry and his people stepped foot into NPR headquarters to record their Tiny Desk concert, the vibes were right. With a 10-piece configuration \u2014 consisting of drums, bass, keys, guitar, horns and percussion \u2014 the rapper put on a flawless and inspired live performance of songs off his latest LP as well as some of his biggest hits, all freshly arranged for the Tiny Desk.  \n\nOver the course of a decade, Curry has released a number of albums and EPs, becoming one of the most versatile emcees in hip-hop today. His sixth studio album, Melt My Eyez See Your Future, marked a new artistic beginning for him: infusing neo-soul, jazz and traditional hip-hop influences into the album, with less \u201crah\u201d and more mature introspection. Throughout this concert, you get a little bit of both. \n\nCurry and the Cold-Blooded Soul Band open their set with \u201cMelt Session #1,\u201d a feel-good neo-soul groove where Curry\u2019s introspective lyrics flow beautifully, taking center stage. Then kicking it up a notch, Curry performs \u201cWalkin\u201d and \u201cTroubles\u201d with an assist from DJ POSHtronaut, employing some serious bounce complimented by catchy horn lines. In the second half of his set, Curry takes us back with \u201cDIET_.\u201d Evoking instant head-bops as bass and drums smoothly lock in, Curry charms our audience with his improvised rhymes and exuberant personality.  \n\nAs Curry and the band closed out the concert going absolutely bonkers with \u201cRICKY,\u201d  I could feel how light the room had gotten as everyone in the audience fed off Curry\u2019s infectious energy fueled by distorted guitar and bass and punchy horns. \u201cYou know I killed that s***. You know I murked that s***!\u201d Yes, Denzel Curry. Yes you did. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cMelt Session #1\u201d\n\u201cWalkin\u201d\n\u201cTroubles\u201d\n\u201cDIET_\u201d\n\u201cCLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N\u201d\n\u201cRICKY\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nDenzel Curry: vocals\nDJ POSHtronaut: vocals\nMarcus Paul: trumpet \nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nTim McKay: saxophone/flute\nAlex Csillag: trombone\nBrian Gazo: percussion\nBrian Patterson: drums\nJay Winfield: keys\nJack Siegel: guitar\nDavid McKinzie: bass\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nEditor: Kara Frame\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #BMM #denzelcurry", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glHqWvkpRqo", "date_published": "2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
