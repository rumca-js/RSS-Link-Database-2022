De Klerk isn’t too short but short enough for Sciver to get her weight back to cross-bunt it through midwicket for four. Balance. That’s the key word there. Balance, and Sciver had it in abundance. No runs from the rest of the over but it’s hard not to feel that Luus has handed the ball to the wrong bowler. Bosch was the pick of the bunch yesterday. What is she being saved for?</p><p><strong>106th over: England 342-6 (Sciver 126, Ecclestone 7) </strong>Kappie is not happy. She’s got her hands on her hips and is scowling at Lee and de Klerk. The former, standing at a fly-slip - half saving one, half stationed there for an opportunistic catch - has to run round and collect the ball as England scamper a single following an Ecclestone edge. But she throws a wild return above the ‘keeper’s Jafta’s head. De Klerk then needs to mop up the mess but she’s sloppy and concedes two additional overthrows. No wonder Kapp is cross!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jun/29/england-v-south-africa-womens-cricket-test-match-day-three-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Belfast to St Ives, 30 UK venues are about to be taken over in an event that will draw on the tragedy of the first world war – and feature deaf dancing, origami clothing and scenes of austerity rendered in fondant icing</p><p>‘I want people to realise disabled people live in a very different world,” says <a href="https://www.carolinecardusartist.com/home">Caroline Cardus</a>. Her artwork, one of 30 being displayed in galleries across the UK on Saturday, depicts scenes from Britain’s decade of austerity – there is even a magic money tree – and asks viewers to consider the brutal impact those political decisions had on disabled people. So far, so conventional.</p><p>Except her medium is cake and the austerity scenes are made out of fondant icing. Cardus wanted to explore the tension created when the politics of people being too poor to eat is embodied in a frivolous foodstuff – let them eat cake writ large. During the show at <a href="https://mkgallery.org/2022/06/20/mk-gallery-goes-dada-for-a-day/">Milton Keynes’ MK Gallery</a>, Cardus is going to give a “cake-pun filled rant” of an artist’s talk (a certain someone’s ambushing by a cake may feature) about the effect austerity has had on disabled people, heightening the absurdist sense of contrast even more. “I like humour in my work even if it’s dark humour – and this is going to be pretty dark,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/29/dont-tone-it-down-invasion-british-museums-disabled-artists-we-are-invisible-visible">Continue reading...</a>

First jailed for organising demonstrations against a law that in effect banned protest altogether, he was re-arrested in 2019 during anti-government protests in which he had no involvement, and last year was sentenced to a further five years in a maximum security prison on charges of “spreading false news undermining national security”, for comments about torture on social media.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/its-a-sham-egypt-accused-of-restricting-protest-in-run-up-to-cop27">Continue reading...</a>

The dead were migrants from Mexico and Central America. The local fire chief, Charles Hood, said the people in the truck were “hot to the touch” and that they had no water and no air conditioning inside the truck.</p><p>That is how they died, but that is not why they died.

We have a gallery show celebrating the work of queer art collective General Idea, a group of artists who will forever be associated with the Aids pandemic and the prejudice many victims of the virus faced in the 80s and 90s. There’s also a show dedicated to Virgil Abloh, the first black creative director at Louis Vuitton. Abloh worked on the exhibition before his untimely death last year, and the centrepiece was ‘Social Sculpture’ a physical space for gatherings designed to counter the historical lack of space afforded to Black artists in cultural institutions. It’s important to honour the creatives who use their voices for political good. Especially as it seems the fight for equality and autonomy is never over.</p><p>For more news on architecture, sustainable living, art, fashion and new ideas, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/09/design-review-get-the-newsletter-for-the-way-we-live-now">sign up for our monthly newsletter here</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/29/june-design-news-edible-sticky-tape-and-celebrating-virgil-abloh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The third in a series of films that asks why swimming at all levels in the UK is such a stubbornly white activity</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/25/racism-has-held-up-ethnic-minorities-in-swimming-says-alice-dearing">Statistics from Sport England</a> show that 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England don’t swim. People from ethnic minorities are at an increased risk of drowning <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drowning">according to the WHO</a>. Now comes this documentary produced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/04/i-was-the-only-black-kid-in-the-pool-why-swimming-is-so-white">Ed Accura of the Black Swimming Association</a>, number three in his Blacks Can’t Swim series. His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/05/blacks-cant-swim-the-sequel-review-ed-accura">last film</a> interviewed 16- to 24-year-olds; here it’s parents talking about their relationship with the water and how it’s affected their kids.</p><p>Some of the speakers grew up with racist stereotypes about swimming – told as children that Black people have denser bones, making it harder to float. One woman explains how her swimming teachers drilled it into her that Black people are not built for swimming. She believed them because when she watched swimming at the Olympics on TV, where were the Black faces? That lack of representation at the elite level is still an issue, believes one talented young athlete, interviewed with his parents; he chose football over swimming. Women talk about their hair and swimming – chlorine damage is something that Great Britain’s only elite Black swimmer Alice Dearing wrote about in <a href="https://gal-dem.com/im-team-gbs-only-black-swimmer-this">a piece on gal-dem</a>.

Frank, warm and funny podcaster and campaigner who raised millions for bowel cancer charities<p>In the last five years of her life, Deborah James, who has died aged 40 from cancer, never stopped talking about life as worth living. She did this as co-host of BBC Radio 5 Live’s award-winning, lively podcast about living with cancer, You, Me and the Big C, originally alongside the broadcast journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/07/rachael-bland-obituary" title="">Rachael Bland</a>, who died in 2018, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/11/love-after-cancer-lauren-mahon-lust-first-dates-podcast-you-me-and-the-big-c-death-rachael-bland" title="">Girl Vs Cancer founder and activist Lauren Mahon</a>.</p><p>From its first episode in March 2018, frankness, honesty and humour were the unique selling points of the show, and Deborah, diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in December 2016, was its outrageous heart. She said that she had “the glam cancer”, and talked in detail about her experiences and symptoms, such as “pooing blood”, because “one of the biggest problems is that people aren’t frank enough”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/29/dame-deborah-james-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just two species of the freshwater fish still exist in the ancient waters of Lake Lanao in the Philippines after predatory fish were accidentally introduced</p><p>It was a celebrated clan: a group of 17 carp species found nowhere else in the world except for an ancient freshwater lake in the Philippines. One so fat it could be fried without oil, another sought after for its delectable egg-filled ovaries, a third known, oddly enough, for its endearing overbite.</p><p>Yet in recent years 15 of them have been declared extinct, victims of mismanaged fish farming efforts that accidentally introduced predatory fish into their home. In all likelihood, these invaders will continue to menace the native carp until none of them are left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/29/15-carp-species-extinct-philippines-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the psychedelic pop band prepare to play Womad, their frontman will take on your questions about their nearly 40-year career</p><p>The Flaming Lips are one of a few bands who have managed to stay both relevant <em>and</em> interesting over a career that has spanned nearly four decades. They found mainstream success with 1999’s The Soft Bulletin – voted NME’s album of the year – followed by 2002’s equally brilliant Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Since then, they’ve won three Grammys and, in 2018, an award for their song Tomorrow Is written – very appropriately – for SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical.</p><p>And that’s exactly the thing about the Flaming Lips. Even diehard fans can’t predict what in the name of Wayne Coyne’s beard they’re going to do next. Who else would have covered the whole of Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper and curated a reworking of the Stone Roses’s debut LP? Or got around the whole Covid social distancing thing by getting the audience to stand in their own personal inflatable plastic bubbles?

## ‘It is more than a song’: the enduring power of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah

<p>In a new documentary, fans and experts explore the legacy of a song originally shunned before becoming a timeless classic</p><p>“I can’t think of any other song with a trajectory of anything like what happened with Hallelujah,” said the author Alan Light of Leonard Cohen’s ubiquitous magnum opus. “When you think of universal global anthems like Imagine or Bridge Over Troubled Water, they were immediate hits. But Hallelujah was first rejected by the record company, and then completely ignored when it came out.”</p><p>So goes the legend of Cohen’s hallmark track which has captivated generations of listeners with a mystique and weight that set it apart in the annals of music history. Perhaps that’s why the aforementioned Light wrote a book entirely about the track: 2012’s The Holy Or the Broken: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley, and the Unlikely Ascent of Hallelujah. It’s that book which serves as the basis for the new documentary Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, A Journey, A Song, which premiered at the Tribeca film festival earlier this month. Directed and produced by Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller, the film takes both a micro and macro view of the song and Cohen, along with their respective and deeply intertwined places in culture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/29/hallelujah-leonard-cohen-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

It was 1987, and before the uniforms cops wear now – I may even have been wearing a serge skirt and thick tights underneath. Shirt, woolly jumper, tunic straining on top. So it was just as well the raincoat flapped miserably wide around my bulked-up form. Strathclyde’s finest, let loose on an unsuspecting Glasgow.</p><p>It was 3am, straight after break, and my sergeant had decided I’d work the second half on foot. For the first half of my first nightshift as a uniformed cop, I’d been ensconced in a patrol car. The driver who was to be my neighbour for the duration (none of this hand-picked “tutor” nonsense then) was clearly delighted. “Sit there, keep them open (pointing to my eyes) and that” – drawing a zip along his own mouth – “shut.” We had spent the time from 11pm till 2am cruising the perimeters of the division, with my neighbour pointing out landmarks and quizzing me about my background. “You got a gimmick or a wire?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jun/29/a-moment-that-changed-me-patrolling-city-glasgow-rookie-cop">Continue reading...</a>

Why aren’t there more bins in this city? Why does Philadelphia [where I live] have such a subpar municipal waste management system?” These are all valid questions (there is a reason Philly has the nickname <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-4a0548b027a74d73bef390f4b39f5466">Filthadelphia</a>), but my wife doesn’t want to hear about city sanitation any more. “Please,” she keeps saying, “get over it!”</p><p>The thing is, I can’t get over it. Is it a function of middle age? Am I losing my mind? I don’t know what has precipitated it, but I am hung up on waste management. I have gone full disgusted-of-Tunbridge-Wells about it, as we all should, really. Litter isn’t just unsightly and unhygienic, it is associated with more crime and antisocial behaviour: cleaning up <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/06/09/por-que-las-calles-mas-limpias-pueden-ser-mas-seguras">neighbourhoods makes them safer</a>.

<p>The next stop in our series marking Interrail’s 50th birthday is a cutting-edge food and design destination that has emerged from the shadow of its medieval fortress</p><p>Graz truly is a tale of two cities. The old town lies on the east bank of the River Mur under the lee of the tree-covered Schlossberg. The hill was a medieval fortress until an irate Napoleon demanded its walls be destroyed by the inhabitants; around its base, a harmonious blend of historic architecture ranging from Franciscan simplicity to Habsburgian splendour now houses a well-heeled commercial centre. Until a generation ago, the east bank’s inhabitants rarely felt the need to venture west, and those who lived on the less fancy side of the river were equally self contained, with their own market, the Lendplatz, and their own green space, the Volksgarten; the old city had its opera, but they had a vaudeville theatre, the Orpheum.</p><p>Then 20 years ago, a “friendly alien” landed on its west bank – the <a href="https://www.museum-joanneum.at/en/kunsthaus-graz">Kunsthaus</a>, the modern art museum designed by architects Peter Cook and Colin Fournier – and the area around it was transformed. Today the bridges across the Mur stream with foot traffic, the most eyecatching of them the <a href="https://architectuul.com/architecture/mur-island">floating island </a>built in 2003 and a testament to Graz’s identity as a design city.

<p>It was an all-inclusive promotion by Holiday Gems and we’ve been left £1,000 out of pocket</p><p><strong>In February, we responded to a promotion by travel firm Holiday Gems for an all-inclusive package to the Bluesea Callao Garden hotel in Tenerife. We paid £850 for a week’s stay in June. On arrival at 9pm, we found the hotel closed. I rang Holiday Gems on its emergency number and was advised to find another hotel that could take us and wait for them to get in touch the following day.</strong></p><p><strong>We are both in our 70s and my wife has recently recovered from major surgery. We had to haul our luggage to the nearest hotel which was full, but the receptionist phoned around and found us a room in town at €104 a night. The next morning there was no word from Holiday Gems. The emergency number was closed so I emailed to say that unless we heard by midday, when we had to check out of our room, we would book it for the remaining six nights. It wasn’t until 12.30pm, when we’d paid another €537 for the week, that Holiday Gems told us we were expected at a hotel in Santiago, 16 miles away.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/29/when-we-arrived-at-9pm-at-our-hotel-in-tenerife-it-was-closed">Continue reading...</a>
