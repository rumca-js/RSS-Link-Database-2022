## Marvel's Midnight Suns Hands-On Preview
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHJTWDTLjJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHJTWDTLjJY)

The logical pitch for Marvel's Midnight Suns is XCOM but with superheroes. But in fact, the new Marvel title from developer Firaxis Games isn't another XCOM game--it's something very different.

The team behind Marvel's Midnight Suns are best known for XCOM, the stellar tactical strategy series about sending squads of elite soldiers against an invading alien force, and often, watching those soldiers die horrifically. The logical pitch for Midnight Suns, then, is XCOM but with superheroes. But in fact, the new Marvel title from developer Firaxis Games is much more RPG than strategy title. This isn't another XCOM game--it's something very different.

As Firaxis notes, Midnight Suns focuses on some of the more "spooky" elements of the Marvel universe, including its more arcane heroes. The initial premise is  pretty standard: The evil military group Hydra uses some occult weirdness to resurrect a supervillain named Lilith, the Mother of Demons, and starts aiding her in taking over the world. To combat that threat, characters like Doctor Strange and Iron Man band together with  more supernaturally-inclined folks from around the Marvel universe, such as Blade, Ghost Rider, and Magick. Included in that group is The Hunter, a fully customizable character you create, who is also Lilith's child and the chosen one who can stop her once and for all.

GameSpot recently got a chance to play about five hours of Midnight Suns at Firaxis's studios in Baltimore, which gave us a close look at the beginning of the game. And yes, this is a turn-based tactical strategy game--but what surprised me most was how much of the game is taken up by storytelling and character interaction. It probably has the most in common with the more character-driven XCOM: Chimera Squad, but even that game pales in comparison to the focus on story in Midnight Suns.

Naughty Dog unveiled a brand new standalone title based on multiplayer in The Last of Us. They showed off concept art from the game, and say it's bigger than any single-player game they've ever done. More information will unveil next year. The Last of Us show is coming to HBO, helmed by the creator of HBO's Chernobyl, is just about wrapped up with filming almost over, and Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey starring in the main roles. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson will have roles in the show as well.

The Last of Us part 1 is being remade for modern consoles as a definitive edition. The Last of Us is commonly considered to be one of the greatest games of the last decade, so fans can play the game remade from the ground up. The AI, combat, and overall gameplay has been redone to more so to match what the team learned from The Last of Us 2. The Last of Us Part 1 Remake releases September 2, 2022.

## Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Preview - Bigger, Smaller, & Less Controversial

We went down to LA for a lengthy briefing on the features of the upcoming Modern Warfare 2, as well as played several maps and modes. Today we’re going to go over the briefing and can talk about hands-on impressions at a future date. We’ll have a larger written preview by Summer Doster that goes into even more granular detail. Modern Warfare 2 releases on October 28, with an open beta before launch. Infinity Ward paid for GameSpot to attend this preview event. Also please note that all gameplay in this video is from older Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare (2019) and Cold War.

Modern Warfare 2 has both bigger and smaller multiplayer modes, with a campaign focused on reliving the greatest hits, like All Ghillied Up, using new twists. Ground War is now just one part of the Battle Maps mode. That means more purpose-built maps that are very much for mil-sim Call Of Duty players who loved the larger open-level design of Modern Warfare 2019. 

Core multiplayer, from what we saw, consists of smaller and more straightforward 6v6 competitive modes, like Knockout and Prisoner Rescue, that will appeal to more classic fast-paced Cold War fans in both map design and aesthetics. We know there will be a Spec-Ops mode, but we didn’t hear any details about it, except it will lean more towards the linear scenarios of the original MW2. When it comes to Warzone, we finally got an answer, and yes, the next Warzone will be a clean start coming soon after Modern Warfare 2's launch. It is separate from the current version of Warzone. In general, weapon customization seems as robust as in MW 2019, with categories of weapons that evolve into other roles as you go through the unlock tree. Perks are now grouped into packages, where you pick two to start with and earn the rest during a match, similar to MW 2019’s specialist option in multiplayer. 

The biggest tech focus in Modern Warfare 2 is water as a movement and escape mechanic. Players can dive and swim into bodies of water, with the water becoming murkier the deeper you go. Ballistics are also impacted by water. Equipment will keep up the sandbox design of Modern Warfare 2019 with things like Cameras, Drill Charges, and Inflatable Dummies. Much of the gear also has alternate water modes. Movement both on foot and in vehicles has been improved. Vehicles, in particular, can now have bumpers ripped off or tires blown out and players, even drivers, can lean out or jump on the roofs of vehicles while they're moving.

Check out the worldwide reveal for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the sequel to 2019’s Modern Warfare, which will showcase the most innovative Call of Duty to date. Fight alongside Task Force 141 in a globe-trotting single-player campaign, play solo or rally with your team in immersive multiplayer combat, with new locales and ways to play. Experience an evolved Special Ops game mode featuring tactical co-op gameplay. 

Additionally look forward to Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 releasing this year. Expect a massive calendar of free content post-launch featuring evolving gameplay with new maps, modes, seasonal events, community celebrations and more.

Mario Strikers: Battle League may be the most mechanically dense Mario sports game I've played. The latest Mushroom Kingdom spin on soccer looks to take the sport seriously, allowing you to juggle passes, tackle, dodge, and cancel moves as the situation demands, even before factoring in its uniquely silly Mario twists.

## New Hideo Kojima Horror Game Leaked | GameSpot News

A new Hideo Kojima horror game has reportedly leaked, Layers Of Fear dev teases a new game as Silent Hill rumors run rampant, and Phil Spencer plays Banjo-Kazooie and fans begin to speculate.

Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima's next game is reportedly a horror title called Overdose that could feature Margaret Qualley who played Mama in Death Stranding. The leak comes from Tom Henderson for Try Hard Guides, who claim to have seen "early footage" of Overdose which shows actress Margaret Qualley in a blue dress. It's no secret that Kojima is working on something, but whether or not it's a new horror game or Death Stranding 2 is unofficial.

Kojima's plans for Silent Hill may be lost, but the Silent Hill franchise continues to live on in the rumor mill. Horror-centric developers Bloober Team, makers of Layers of Fear, Blair Witch, and The Medium, has released a teaser for a new project, one that alludes to a new Layers of Fear - after all, it was posted from the Layers of Fear 2 official Twitter account. However, that teaser comes amidst ongoing rumors that Bloober Team may also be working on a Silent Hill game in collaboration with Konami. 

Xbox head Phil Spencer was caught playing Banjo-Kazooie recently, and the result has fans thinking it's a tease for an upcoming announcement of a new Banjo-Kazooie. According to Phil Spencer's Xbox activity, which can be tracked using xboxgamertag.com, P3, or Phil Spencer, showed he was playing the classic platformer just five days ago for a total of 37 minutes - just enough time to unlock a single achievement. However, he hasn't touched it since then. Instead he's been busy with the Elden Ring and Ninja Gaiden. Maybe Banjo-Kazooie wasn't hard enough for him. Still, the rumor mill has swirled regardless.
