It’s been over two years since we’ve had the opportunity to have a live musical guest in the Radio Heartland studio, and so booking our first, Canadian musician Matt Andersen, and actually seeing it through was a magical experience.

Matt Andersen is Juno Award-nominated musician originally from New Brunswick and now based in Nova Scotia. He has been touring the world for the past 20 years or so with his powerhouse vocals and amazing rhythm and blues band, but his 15th and most recent album, “House to House,” is a little different. He recorded the record on his property with his musical friends all in the room with him. And he based his songs on the acoustic guitar, rather than the electric licks his audience is used to.

The result: true roots music with a little gospel flair, perhaps…and a pleasure to listen to.
 
Matt Andersen was “Live Guest Number 1” for Radio Heartland since the start of the COVID pandemic. And what a way to start!
