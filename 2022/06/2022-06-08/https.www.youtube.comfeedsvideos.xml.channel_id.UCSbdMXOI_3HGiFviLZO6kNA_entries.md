This past week I went to AWE otherwise known as the Augmented World Expo! One of the worlds largest XR conferences! At this event I got to see SO much amazing technology, it boggled my mind- From Haptx gloves to the Varjo XR3 and the most cutting edge consumer AR glasses available. 

Thank you to Qualcomm for sponsoring this video and getting PHIA and I out to AWE to share the experience!
