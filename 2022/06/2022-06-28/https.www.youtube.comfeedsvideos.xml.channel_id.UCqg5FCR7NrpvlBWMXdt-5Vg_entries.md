Marty, KC and Nick sit down to discuss the their favorite franchises across media and when maybe, it's just not the content you enjoy anymore.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
