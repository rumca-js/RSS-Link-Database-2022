## PlayStation Plus Games Revealed Alongside New Gaming Tech From Sony | GameSpot News

July's PlayStation Plus games have been confirmed, Sony unveils its new InZone monitors and headphones, as well as Skull & Bones release date news.

July’s rumored PlayStation Plus games have been confirmed, and the PS5 is getting some exciting new accessories. Plus, an update for Skull and Bones on today’s GameSpot News.

After initially leaking, as PlayStation Plus games are known to do, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan, and Arcadeggedon are confirmed to be your included titles for July on the service.

Subscribers of any tier will now be able to enjoy the entire Bandicoot Saga, the original three games already a part of the PS Plus Collection via the N. Sane Trilogy. Man of Medan is a horror game from developer Supermassive, which recently put out another spooky title The Quarry, and Arcadeggedon is an arena shooter with both PVE and PVP elements. All three titles will be available to download at no additional cost for subscribers on July 5.

That’s not the only thing up Sony’s sleeve! The company also announced that it is releasing a number of gaming accessories as a part of a new gaming brand, InZone. The initial lineup consists of two monitors and three gaming headphones, with both sets of products designed for use with PCs and PlayStation consoles.

The pair of monitors are being dubbed the M9 and M3. The M9 sports a 27” 4K display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Supporting video input via HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and USB-C, the device can connect to a beefy gaming rig, a MacBook Air, or any device in between. And thanks to features like auto HDR tone mapping, this monitor is built to make tinkering with settings on a PlayStation 5 less cumbersome. Later in the year, the more affordable M3 will drop, sporting a lower resolution 1080p display, but increasing the refresh rate to 240Hz. Considering the PS5 only supports up to a 120Hz output, the higher refresh rate really only concerns users looking to connect the monitor to a PC.

The InZone headphone line consists of a wired option, the H3, and two wireless options, the H7 and H9. The differences in the wireless options have mostly to do with active noise cancelation, the H7 lacking support for the feature, but with an increased battery life due to that fact. For more details on both the monitor and headphone lineups, like specific specs and how to get your hands on them, head to GameSpot.com.

## Nintendo Direct Confirmed & Metroid Prime Remastered May Be Coming Soon | GameSpot News

Nintendo is having a last minute, mini Direct before the end of June, Metroid Prime Remastered may be coming to the Switch this Holiday, PlayStation Plus games for July leak, and Hideo Kojima scrapped a The Boys-like project.

A new Nintendo Direct is imminent, and Metroid Prime might be coming to Switch this year? All this andmore on today’s GameSpot News.

For the past few weeks, a Nintendo Direct (*Xenoblade Direct footage on screen* No, not that one) has been rumored to be in the works before the end of June. In the eleventh hour, Nintendo confirmed that a Direct is indeed happening *cheering sound effect* buuuuutttttt *record scratch sound effect ends cheering* that it’s going to be one of its mini presentations exclusively dealing with third party titles. So expect to see some news on titles like Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope rather than the sequel to Breath of the Wild.

Jeff Grubb of GameSpot’s sister site GiantBomb has stated that he has heard Nintendo plans to spread out its Not-E3 presentations over the course of the summer, so even if this Direct doesn’t speak to you, you might not have to wait much longer for one that does.

Speaking of Jeff Grubb and waiting, this year is the 20th anniversary of the beloved Metroid Prime, and it seems that Nintendo might finally be ready to put out a remaster of this classic in time for that celebration. Grubb reports that he has been told “pretty definitively” that the remaster will be one of Nintendo’s big holiday 2022 releases. Grubb also notes that rather than a package of the entire trilogy, this release will only be a remaster of the first Metroid Prime, and while there are plans to eventually rerelease two and three, those titles might not get the same level of overhaul.
But leaks don’t stop there! Also potentially revealed are July’s PlayStation Plus titles. Via Dealabs, it seems subscribers to the service, on every tier, will be able to get Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon when the monthly games refresh on July 5. 

Not only is the recently released fourth Crash Bandicoot a great get on its own, but the remastered N. Sane trilogy of the first three games is already available via the PlayStation Plus Collection, so players can complete the entire Bandicoot saga. For those that have checked out Supermassive’s latest horror game The Quarry, and are itching for more, Man of Medan is the first release in the developer’s Dark Picture Anthology series, featuring similar mechanics and spooky delights. The final title, Arcadegeddon, released in early access last summer, and is a multiplayer shooter set in an arcade game with both PvP and PvE elements. While it has flown relatively under the radar since launching, its inclusion in next month’s PS Plus lineup is sure to give it a shot in the arm.

Of course, with new PS Plus games incoming means old PS Plus Games outgoing, so these are the last few days you have to claim 2018’s God of War, Nintendo All-Star Brawl and Norotu to Boruto: Shinobi Strikers before they’re gone.

Something else that’s gone is a potential Hideo Kojima superhero project. In a tweet thread, the iconic developer mentions how he shelved plans for a “radical hard-boiled action film” that pit a special detective squad against superheroes after the release of Amazon Prime’s The Boys, a TV show with a similar scope. Kojima states that he pictured one of the actors in his latest game Death Stranding, Mads Mikkelsen, in the lead role.

Kojima, if you’re watching this, I’m begging you: please bring this project back to life.

While you at home too mourn the loss of a hard-boiled detective story helmed by Hideo Kojima, distract yourself with the Overwatch 2 open beta starting on June 28th, now on both PC and console. If that’s not your bag, on the same day, Jane Foster AKA the Mighty Thor will become a playable hero in Marvel’s Avengers with her own unique moves and battle pass separate from the original God of Thunder.

## Steam Deck Might Finally Be Getting Easier To Buy | GameSpot News

Valve is doubling the amount of Steam Decks it's shipping, a bunch of announcements from the latest Nintendo Direct, and Fallout 4 is getting a London makeover.

Praise Gabe! The Steam Deck is about to get a lot easier to buy. Plus, you can play a bunch of new, old games on the Nintendo Switch. This and more on today’s GameSpot News.

With the end of June approaching, and the arrival of Q3, Steam put out a statement that is going to make a lot of gamers happy. For anyone that has a Steam Deck reserved with a Q3 fulfillment period listed, the first batch of emails for that group will be going out on June 30, before the next quarter has officially even started!

What’s more, the company also confirms that they’re increasing production, and will be shipping more than double the amount of Decks it was previously. That means, if you’re in that Q3 bracket, you’re more than twice as likely to receive an email, than say, I was when I had my Q2 order.

I would say I was jealous, but what do I have to be jealous about? I have my Steam Deck already.

To prepare for your handheld’s arrival, remember that Steam’s Summer Sale is happening until July 7, so make sure to check it out for any games you plan to play on Deck, as well as GameSpot.com for the best deals you can find.

Moving from the portable PC to its distant cousin, the Switch, Nintendo today had a Direct mini, unveiling a slew of games releasing in the coming months. Many of those announced are older titles that are finally making their way to the handheld, such as Portal 1 and 2 as a part of the Companion Collection, out today on Switch, as well as Persona 3 - 5, previously announced for Xbox Game Pass and Steam, with the most recent entry landing on October 21.
