<p>Neither Brexit nor Scottish independence offer the clean break that many hope for</p><p>The supreme court has been asked to decide whether a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/28/nicola-sturgeon-seeks-supreme-court-ruling-on-scottish-independence-referendum-vote" title="">Scottish independence referendum</a> can take place legally next October. No one should be surprised. One of the court’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-180614.pdf" title="">responsibilities</a> is to decide whether a bill in a devolved legislature falls outside its legislative competence. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, has been looking for a legal way to hold a non-binding vote on Scotland’s 315-year-old union with the UK. She is hoping judges give her the authority to hold one. The court might say a “consultative” referendum – Indyref2 – is <a href="https://twitter.com/PeatWorrier/status/1541785063746150400?s=20&amp;amp;t=qNFMIwfpzO3e_e4kbiAkWw" title="">legal</a>. But since unanimously declaring Boris Johnson’s “prorogation” of parliament unlawful, the court seems <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/06/02/britains-supreme-court-takes-a-conservative-turn" title="">wary</a> of constitutional confrontations.</p><p>Ms Sturgeon has had to gamble because the prime minister is opposed to another independence referendum, arguing that the 2014 vote was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-scotland-idUSKBN2BG2KA" title="">“once in a generation”</a> event. If the bench were to endorse another vote, then Lord Reed, the court president and an experienced Edinburgh judge, might become – perhaps to his dismay – a folk hero to Scottish nationalists. If judges decline to do so, Ms Sturgeon says she will fight the next UK general election on the <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-sets-date-proposed-135627776.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANlUcad6ymBr2bbE_a89ukuXDoRd1X6sD6zMWWsKy86NmSPiq2kZQxH4VQh1-5RwRyXlwXRvIoQ-3ZK0BON0NxTFPaJMYNAU7mokaiWIirxz-GRaoStKCuQyvG4XXnGm57BngGHECS-3SiMWHz8rmww-SwabdNp0dNYJ00OlXQW" title="">issue of independence</a>.

<p>Reducing methane emissions is the fastest-acting lever we can pull to moderate temperature rise and lessen the damage of climate change, writes <strong>Adair Turner</strong></p><p>Aidan Harrison’s letter (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/23/livestock-farmers-are-not-the-enemy-in-climate-crisis-battle" title="">23 June</a>) took issue with George Monbiot’s argument that grazing cattle and sheep impose a huge environmental cost (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/20/minority-rural-britons-farmers-farming-countryside-environment" title="">Opinion, 20 June</a>). However, Harrison’s criticisms were deeply flawed.</p><p>Ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep produce methane, an immensely powerful greenhouse gas. Harrison argues that these emissions do not matter because they are relatively short-lived and in some sense “natural”. But a flow of continued methane emissions from any source warms the planet, and that warming effect will only decline if the emissions are reduced. Indeed, precisely because methane is short-lived in the atmosphere, cutting methane emissions is the fastest-acting lever we can pull to moderate temperature rise and reduce the risks of self-reinforcing climate change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/28/the-environmental-case-for-cutting-down-on-red-meat-is-clear">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exclusive: Campaigners say funding may provide incentive to restart fracking if moratorium is lifted</p><p>Fracking companies are likely to be eligible for tax breaks, potentially worth billions, that the government is extending to oil and gas companies to encourage new exploration of fossil fuel resources.</p><p>Combined with high gas prices, the extra funding – which amounts to a subsidy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/26/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-sticking-plaster-climate-groups">according to campaigners</a> – could provide a strong incentive to restart fracking operations if a moratorium in the UK is lifted, which could happen as early as this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/28/fracking-firms-could-be-eligible-for-uk-tax-breaks-worth-billions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a painful and lengthy murder trial, the journalist still had questions about why her father had died. So she set out to meet the gang member jailed for the killing<br /></p><p>Two days after burying her mother’s ashes in the summer of 2008, Liz McGregor received a devastating phone call. Her 79-year-old father, Robin, was also dead – and his house 75 miles north of Cape Town, where she lived, was now the scene of a murder inquiry. His car, a bronze-coloured Mercedes that had for years been his pride and joy, had been discovered by police a few miles away in a poor neighbourhood with its lights on. A man was arrested as he tried to run away and officers found blood on his clothes. In the house itself there were no fingerprints, because whoever had murdered Robin McGregor had been wearing gloves.</p><p>So began a story that brings McGregor face to face with South Africa’s brutal history and the violence it has spawned. Her new book, <a href="https://jonathanball.co.za/component/virtuemart/unforgiven-face-to-face-with-my-father-s-killer?Itemid=491">Unforgiven: Face to Face with My Father’s Killer</a>, is so unflinching that it challenges its readers to look away first: it’s her way of processing the horror, she says. “It changed me fundamentally. When you get such a profound shock, you rethink everything. I’ve always lived my life afraid of what might happen, and when this earthquake happens, at the start you become slightly numb, then you become grief-stricken and terrified and angry, and gradually you become slightly more inured to things.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jun/28/south-africas-pain-and-anger-are-mine-too-how-liz-mcgregor-confronted-her-fathers-killer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jessica Glenza reports on the supreme court ruling and the profound consequences it will have for women facing unwanted pregnancies across the United States</p><p>On Friday the US supreme court overturned Roe vs Wade, the legal precedent that had protected the right to an abortion since 1973.</p><p>After the decision, 26 state legislatures moved to ban abortion immediately or as soon as practically possible. This will leave millions of women without access to a legal termination in their home state. Many will have to travel hundreds of miles to access a safe abortion in another state or try to terminate their pregnancy themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/jun/28/the-womens-lives-in-danger-in-a-post-roe-america">Continue reading...</a>
