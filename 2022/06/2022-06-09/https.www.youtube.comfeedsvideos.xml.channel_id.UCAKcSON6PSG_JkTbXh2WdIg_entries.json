He has been touring the world for the past 20 years or so with his powerhouse vocals and amazing rhythm and blues band, but his 15th and most recent album, \u201cHouse to House,\u201d is a little different. He recorded the record on his property with his musical friends all in the room with him. And he based his songs on the acoustic guitar, rather than the electric licks his audience is used to.\n\nThe result: true roots music with a little gospel flair, perhaps\u2026and a pleasure to listen to.\n \nMatt Andersen was \u201cLive Guest Number 1\u201d for Radio Heartland since the start of the COVID pandemic. And what a way to start!\n\nSongs played\n00:00 Coal Mining Blues\n04:38 Other Side of Goodbye\n07:15 See This Through\n\nCredits\nMike Pengra - host\nCraig Thorson - audio engineer\nEric Romani - video & photo\nLuke Taylor - digital production\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#mattandersen #mattandersenmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O31jMF_F77E", "date_published": "2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
