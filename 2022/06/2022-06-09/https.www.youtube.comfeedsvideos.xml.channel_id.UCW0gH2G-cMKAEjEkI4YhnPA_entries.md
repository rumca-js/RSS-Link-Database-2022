For some time, I've wanted to make a video discussing my hopes and fears for Rings of Power.  While I've mentioned nearly all of these in previous livestreams and breakdowns, I wanted to compile them for those who may not have caught my previous conversations.  With less than three months until it's premiere, and with the ability to talk more about what I heard and saw in London, I thought it would be a great time to dive into my hopes and fears for this series...
