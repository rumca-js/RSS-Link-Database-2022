How to store and exchange value has been a decades-long puzzle among cypherpunk and FLOSS circles, resulting in many payment processors, ecashes, Bitcoin, Monero, GNU Taler and many other projects. This talk overviews the core issues and solutions, and what hope we can place in free software to secure our privacy and access to sound money.\n\nand possibly as well:\n\"Reject Modernity. Return to Web 1.0.\"\n\nThe once colorful and chaotic Internet was filtered into a small number convenient social media sites in the early 2000s. While this shift enabled microinteractions like \"liking\" and commenting and standardized user accounts, nearly all Internet traffic is oligopolized by several \"Big Tech\" sites are personal websites are now a rarity. This doesn't have to be inevitable. As public perception of social media sites has now soured, tools from faster Internet speeds, to static-site generators, federated software, even old RSS have given us a second chance at an Internet that is easy-to-use, powerful and controlled by the user.\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nClassical books reprinted by me: https://lindypress.net\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\nBTC: bc1qw5w6pxsk3aj324tmqrhhpmpfprxcfxe6qhetuv\nXMR: 48jewbtxe4jU3MnzJFjTs3gVFWh2nRrAMWdUuUd7Ubo375LL4SjLTnMRKBrXburvEh38QSNLrJy3EateykVCypnm6gcT9bh\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M9IbeaBlmI", "date_published": "2022-05-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
