In this video we break down 7 different ways Fortnite pioneered the live-service model of free-to-play games from establishing a successful battle pass, to being the first game to get true cross-play and cross-progression across major platforms. #Gaming #Fortnite #GameSpot\n\nFew games have made a lasting impact on a global scale like Fortnite. Epic Games free-to-play battle royale erupted onto the scene in 2017 and never looked back, constantly pushing the envelope and redefining what a live-service game should be. In this video we break down some of the significant changes Fortnite pioneered through its battle-royale game mode.\n\nWe take a deep look into Fortnite\u2019s history and the state of gaming before then. For example cross-play and cross-progression systems were still uncommon and not something gamers expected to be a thing until Fortnite put the pressure on Sony to relent on its stingy position on multiplayer servers and their exclusivity on particular platforms.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand live-service games and microtransactions were increasingly common but few games were able to figure out how to make a rewarding system where players could feel like the free-to-play games were more than simple loot box cash cows. Not to mention consistent content updates and once in a lifetime live events. The jaw dropping concerts helmed by some of the biggest pop culture icons of our generation all in-game, are just some of the few ways Fortnite pioneered radical change in games.\n\nWe\u2019ll have so much more to break down on Fortnite as well as other popular shooters like Call of Duty and Halo, so be sure to subscribe to GameSpot for all things gaming!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PllNVtwPb0", "date_published": "2022-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
