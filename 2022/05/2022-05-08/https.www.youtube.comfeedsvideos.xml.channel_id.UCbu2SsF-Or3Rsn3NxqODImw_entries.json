However an updated listing on the PlayStation store caused some speculation as to whether or not the game would be expanding that co-op to 4 players instead. Well in a statement PCGamesN via Twitter, Warner Bros Games brand manager Devon Newberry confirmed Gotham Knights will \u201chave two-player campaign co-op as announced previously.\n\nOver the weekend, the Xbox Network struggled with some server issues that made some digital games completely unplayable, even offline. Parris Lilly, who has worked with Xbox in the past, said he hopes Microsoft can be more transparent in the future about its digital rights management (DRM) policy and offer new solutions to avoid these types of headaches for players in the future.\n\nBaby Shark, the popular and catchy YouTube song you've involuntarily heard, is teaming up with PUBG Mobile to deliver exclusive themed unlockable items. This is the second collaboration following last year\u2019s, which gave players a Baby Shark emote and allowed them to unlock permanent Baby Shark outfits by sharing the in-game emote in creative ways.\n\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:07 - Gotham Knights\n01:22 - Xbox troubles\n02:30 - PUBG x Baby Shark", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwWsxl8Wvzs", "date_published": "2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Sword Master Reacts to Elden Ring Weapons", "description": "David Rawlings, a Sword Master and founder of the London Longsword Academy, breaks down some of the weapons from Elden Ring, everything from katanas and flails to giant anchors and turtle shell shields.\n\nFirearms Expert Reacts Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5O-CDq7R\n\nIf you are interested in training with David and team and learn how to swordfight, check out www.londonlongsword.com or send an email to enquiry@londonlongsword.com\n\u00a0\nIf you would like to see more videos of David Rawlings and the London Longsword Academy (LLA) check out their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/LondonLongsword\n\u00a0\nIf you like swords and martial arts content, follow the LLA on Instagram \u00a0Master_at_Arms and Swordfightress or Facebook London Longsword Academy.\n\nTo see more of Da'Mon Stith you can head to www.silentsword.org or check him out on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/c/DaMonStith\n\nWeapons Featured:\n\nIntro: 00:00\nBroadsword: 00:27\nUchigatana/Katana: 02:57\nNightrider Flail: 04:35\nShotel: 06:40\nRogier's Rapier: 09:18\nZweihander: 12:32\nBattle Hammer & Turtle Shield: 14:18", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw-aBjRIvVg", "date_published": "2022-05-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
