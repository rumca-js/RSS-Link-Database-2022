Clive Wearing lives life 7 seconds at a time. That's because he has both retrograde and anterograde amnesia, which means he has no ability to form new memories and remembers nothing of his life before. It's hard to imagine what it's like to live like this, but his condition teaches us a lot about how we form memories and how the structure of the brain structures our lives.
