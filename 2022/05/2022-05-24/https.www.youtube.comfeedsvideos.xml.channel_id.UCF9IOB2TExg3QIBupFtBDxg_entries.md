18.5% of controls experienced at least one incident condition.

Survivors aged 18–64

One in 5

Survivors aged ≥65

One in 4

experiencing an incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19

Conditions affected multiple systems

cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric signs and symptoms

Highest risk ratios (RRs)

Acute pulmonary embolism

18 to 64, RR = 2.1

≥65, RR = 2.1

RR = 2.1 and 2.2 among persons aged 18–64 and ≥65 years, respectively) and 

Respiratory signs and symptoms

RR = 2.1 in both age groups

The research study

A retrospective matched cohort design

March 2020–November 2021

63.4 million unique adult records

110 data contributors in the 50 states

Case-patients, 353,164
Control patients, 1,640,776

Case-patients or control patients with a previous history of one of the included conditions were excluded

No significant difference

Cerebrovascular disease

Mental health conditions

Substance-related disorders

Differences by age group were noted

RR for cardiac dysrhythmia

18 to 64, RR = 1.7

≥65, RR = 1.5

Musculoskeletal pain

18–64, RR = 1.6

≥65, RR = 1.4

RRs for 10 incident conditions, significantly higher among those aged ≥65

Renal failure, thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, muscle disorders, neurologic conditions, and mental health conditions (including mood disorders, anxiety, other mental conditions, and substance-related disorders

Limitations

Patients infected with recent variants

Acute COVID-19 infection might be biased toward a population that is seeking care

COVID-19 vaccination status was not considered in this analysis

Transmission

Contact with an infected animal or human

Respiratory droplets

Lesions

Skin contact

Broken skin

Bodily fluids

Mucous membranes

Contaminated materials, bed linens, clothing, towels

Fomites

 

https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-monkeypox-outbreak

Mortality is higher among children and young adults, and immunocompromised individuals are especially at risk of severe disease. 

Most people recover within weeks. 

Most cases presented with lesions on the genitalia or peri-genital area, indicating that transmission likely occurs during close physical contact during sexual activities.

President Biden

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/22/world/asia/monkeypox-biden-concern.html

They haven’t told me the level of exposure yet, but it is something that everybody should be concerned about

We’re working on it hard to figure out what we do and what vaccine may be available
But it is a concern in the sense that if it were to spread it would be consequential

everybody should be concerned about the rise in cases

92 confirmed cases outside Africa in the current outbreak

Massachusetts, Florida, New York City 

https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/treatment.html

Currently, there is no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox virus infection. 

For purposes of controlling a monkeypox outbreak in the United States, smallpox vaccine, antivirals, and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) can be used.

Spain

Cases, 30, most linked to,

Enrique Ruiz Escudero, cabinet minister for health

Superspreader event, adult sauna, Madrid

The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis...to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible

Contact tracing

Quarantine of close contacts

Belgium

3 cases inked to The Darklands Festival, Antwerp

There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries (Festival organisers)

Starts nowish

Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation Europe

As we enter the summer season in the European region, with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, 

I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity,

and the symptoms are unfamiliar to many

Monkeypox is normally a virus that is hard to spread from one person to another, and this is the first time there has been sustained human to human transmission outside Africa. 

Bavarian Nordic, Bernard Hoet, (biotechnology company)

an undisclosed European country, order for vaccine doses

The reason why this vaccine was developed was to have a safe vaccine for stockpiling in case of outbreaks of smallpox. 

We are in contact with the UK authorities about the use of the vaccine.

An acute illness with fever  more than 38.3⁰C (101⁰F)

Chills

Intense headache

Prodromal lymphadenopathy

Back pain and muscle aches

Myalgia and intense asthenia

Followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash,

often beginning on the face (most dense),

and then spreading elsewhere on the body, 

including soles of feet and palms of hands. 

Symptomatic, then rash, 1 to 5 days after first symptoms

The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

(can look like chickenpox or syphilis)

Starts as raised spots, forming into fluid filled blisters, then scabs which fall off

Lesions can be very itchy or painful
