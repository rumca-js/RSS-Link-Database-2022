I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Visiting London 1932-1933, Piccadilly Circus. Street scenes of a policeman directing traffic. Double decker buses. Trafalgar Square. Street scenes. Horse guards

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
