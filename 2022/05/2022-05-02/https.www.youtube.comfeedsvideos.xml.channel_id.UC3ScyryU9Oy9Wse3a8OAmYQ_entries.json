But \"The Power of Big Oil: Delay\" goes on to recount how some in the environmental community were witnessing widespread leaks \u2014 and how, in the years since, numerous studies have pointed to the dangers of methane emissions from oil and gas production.\n\nLearn more at pbs.org/frontline: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-natural-gas-methane-leaks-exxon-mobil-engineer-power-of-big-oil/\n\nPart three of \u201cThe Power of Big Oil,\u201d \u201cDelay,\u201d premieres May 3 on PBS and online: https://to.pbs.org/3rByEEe \n\n\nPart one, \u201cDenial,\u201d is now streaming: https://bit.ly/3xTxYhg \n\nPart two, \u201cDoubt,\u201d is also streaming: https://bit.ly/37UjSSm\n\n\u201cThe Power of Big Oil\u201d is a FRONTLINE Production with Mongoose Pictures in association with BBC and Arte.

(From 2005)\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate. \n\nIn the summer of 2005, more than 30 years after Roe v. Wade established access to abortion services as a fundamental right, a FRONTLINE documentary team spent two months traveling across the South, where states had been particularly active in passing restrictions on abortion. \n\n\"The assault on abortion rights is very clever. It's very smart. And we are losing,\" one anonymous abortion provider said in the resulting documentary.\n\nIn interviews with abortion providers and their patients, with staff at an anti-abortion pregnancy counseling center, and with key legal strategists on both sides of the national debate, producer Raney Aronson-Rath documented the success of the anti-abortion movement and the growing number of states with regulations limiting access to abortion. The documentary traced that success back to how anti-abortion advocates seized on Planned Parenthood v. Casey \u2014 the 1992 Supreme Court decision that upheld Roe v. Wade but changed the standard by which abortion laws were judged. \n\n\u201cTheir tactics changed,\u201d Betty Thompson, former director of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic, told FRONTLINE of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s response to Casey. \u201cThey began to see: \u2018We have political clout now. And so while we have this power, we\u2019re going to chip away at Roe v. Wade until the law is going to be on the books, but nobody will be able to access the service.'\u201d \n\nThe documentary explored how Mississippi was a model for the anti-abortion movement\u2019s efforts. \n\n\u201cMississippi has an impressive track record,\u201d Clarke Forsythe, senior legal counsel for Americans United for Life, told FRONTLINE. \u201cOur goal is to see that other states pass the type of legislation that Mississippi has passed over the past decade, and we see a lot of legislative activity.\u201d\n\n#Documentaries #RoevWade \n\nLove FRONTLINE?
