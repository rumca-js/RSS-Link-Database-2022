Hello! Today we're going to talk about my most anticipated VR title of 2022, BoneLab by developers Stress Level Zero, follow up to 2019's Boneworks. Releasing this year on basically all major VR platforms. In this video I will do a full dive on why I think Bonelab will absolutely change the gaming landscape for VR. I have a feeling when we look back on this release we'll be looking back with the same eyes that we currently look back on Warcraft III or Half Life- Buckle up. This is about to be a crazy ride.
