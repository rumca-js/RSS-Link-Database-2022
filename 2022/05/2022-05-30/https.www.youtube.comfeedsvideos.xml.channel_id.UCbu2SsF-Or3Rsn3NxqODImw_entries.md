Ahead of Summer Game Fest, we ask the show's curator, producer, and host, Geoff Keighley a string of 20 questions. Who is his best friend? What's his favourite album? What's the deal with strawberries? He answers all these questions and more. #summergamefest #GameSpot #gaming

Geoff Keighley is one of the most recognizable figures in the video game industry. His long and storied career began in journalism and he has worked at a number of well-known publications, including GameSpot. These days, however, he is most well known for putting on shows like The Game Awards, Opening Night Live, and, of course, Summer Game Fest. 

Since their inception, these events have been a way to celebrate games and the people that create them, while also generating hype for the video game experiences that await us. Regardless of which Geoff Keighley event you're watching, you know you're in for a bombastic production with trailers, musical performances, and memorable interviews. 

Despite this, Geoff remains a bit of a man of mystery. So, in the lead-up to Summer Game Fest 2022, we caught up with Keighley to play a different kind of game with him: 20 Questions. In this video you'll learn about Geoff's favorite music and food, his most memorable live show moments, and more. 

The Summer Game Fest Live 2022 takes place Thursday, June 9. It begins at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET will air across the usual streaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch. The presentation will also be broadcast in select IMAX theaters. Summer Game Fest will be followed by Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition.
