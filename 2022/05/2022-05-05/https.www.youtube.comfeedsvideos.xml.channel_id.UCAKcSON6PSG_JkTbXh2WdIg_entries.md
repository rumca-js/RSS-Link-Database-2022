Stewart Copeland rose to international renown for his work as a drummer for the innovative rock band, the Police. Beyond his work as a rock drummer, Copeland has also forged a successful career as a composer, creating music for films, television and the stage. He also recently won a Grammy for Best New Age Album for his work with composer Ricky Kej on the album Divine Tides.

Ahead of a visit to the Twin Cities on May 7 and 8 for a couple of events with VocalEssence, Copeland connected with The Current’s Jill Riley for a talk about his career as a composer, his friendship with the late Taylor Hawkins, and about John Milton’s Paradise Lost, the inspiration for Copeland’s work Satan’s Fall, which VocalEssence will perform on May 8.
