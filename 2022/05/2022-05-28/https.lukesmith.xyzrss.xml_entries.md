<p>Title says the gist.</p>
<p>In 2018, I went to <a href="https://southeastlinuxfest.org/">Southeast Linuxfest</a> and gave a presentation <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/uxiCWDTRHYstoeTQfCg2Fa">which you can see here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnCXJn2cRf4"><img alt="" src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/yt.svg" /></a>.
It was nice meeting the (shockingly normal) people who knew me from the interest last time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be attending again this year, as the title says June 10-12 in Charlotte, NC.
I&rsquo;ve already had one talk confirmed (and might actually be giving two).</p>
<p>If you are interested in going, <a href="https://southeastlinuxfest.org/">see their site</a>.
The conference itself is at the Sheraton near the Charlotte Airport and <a href="https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1650480861787&amp;key=GRP&amp;app=resvlink">they still have some rooms on their block left now</a>, but order ASAP if you want to stay in the building. Obviously there are many other hotels to stay at nearby too (I stayed elsewhere last time).</p>
<p>Last time, I went with a group of others and skipped the presentations on Sunday morning to go to church services.
I&rsquo;ll <em>probably</em> do that again, although obviously this time we&rsquo;ll attend an <a href="https://www.assemblyofbishops.org/directories/parishes?radius=15&amp;search_address=charlotte%2C%20nc&amp;search_coordinates=(35.2270869%2C%20-80.8431267)&amp;search_error=OK&amp;searchType=proximity">Orthodox church TBD</a> so come with some reverent attire.</p>
