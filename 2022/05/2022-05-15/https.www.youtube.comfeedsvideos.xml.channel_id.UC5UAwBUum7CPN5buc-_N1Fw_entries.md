You get a top bar and a bottom dock, a layout that's now really common, and easily replicated on any Linux desktop. Mac OS goes for the global menu, which I like.

The dock itself just hosts open application, and open windows for apps that aren't in the dock, plus it has the trashcan, recent applications, and a few nice features.

It also has one very annoying limitation: you can't minimize an app by clicking on its icon, which is very, very frustrating.

The desktop holds icons, by default, only your disk drives, but you can store anything you want there, with a nice feature: the ability to automatically stack files by file type.

In terms of options and look and feel, you find a light or dark mode, with an auto switch depending on the time of day, and accent colors.

Finally, to run applications, you either launch them from the dock, or you have a full screen app grid  with search, that works pretty much like the GNOME app grid.

You get the excellent Spotlight, which lets you search for virtually anything;: files, apps, settings, webpages, you name it.

Window management on mac is a nightmare. You get the close button, the maximize button, and the minimize button. 

The close button doesn't close the app, it closes the window.

If you minimize the the app's icon, and you have multiple windows minimized, clicking on the app's icon will only bring back the last window you minimized. Subsequent clicks don't do anything.

Then there's the maximize button, which doesn't only maximize, but takes the window full screen.  If you press the ALT key and then click on the green button, then your window will not maximize, or go full screen, it will just expand to fit as much of the content as it can.

Then there's the tiling. You can't just drag a window to an edge of the screen to tile it. You have to long press the green button to access a small submenu that lets you pick an edge to tile the window.

Now there's a good part, still, the Multitasking view, called Mission control. You can access it with an icon on the dock, a hot corner, or a keyboard shortcut.
Again, good idea, mediocre implementation. the GNOME activities view beats that without breaking a sweat.

On to application updates and installing them. Here, your default option is the mac app store. It's a beautiful face on a not so well stocked app selection. 

We could learn a thing or two about how they present apps. They have editorial content presenting stuff users might need, by type of activity, they present the most used and downloaded apps first, something we still don't do.

If you can't find what you're loking for on the Store, then you can still resort to the "hunt online for a downloadable app" solution.

What you get in the process is a DMG file, which is a disk image. TO install your app, you have to open the DMG file, and then drag the application to your Applications folder. Sounds simple on paper, and most DMG files have some kind of visual explanation to let users know they need to drag the app into the folder.

The issue here, is that I've met a number of people who never understood that. They open the app from the DMG image.
