It\u2019s a game that sports massive Hitman-esque levels with tons of secrets, unlockables, and routes to find. Sniper Elite 5 also features extensive gun customization, with ammo types, scopes, wraps, trigger assemblies, and barrel attachments to swap out between missions or at weapon benches within each level. Players can build multiple load-outs to fit their playstyles. Because it\u2019s a sandbox, there\u2019s a lot to learn and plenty of things you probably didn\u2019t know you could do.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll show you 10 things we wish we knew before starting Sniper Elite 5. That means covering how powerful bottles really are in the game, why the 1911 pistol is one of the best starting weapons, why you should run through levels at first, and what weapon mechanics you should know about. Then, we\u2019ll teach you how to survive player invasions, master the art of setting traps and distractions, use the overpowered melee to your best advantage, and even how to play if you don\u2019t like stealth. Finally, we\u2019ll take the most hardcore mil-sim players through the basics of Authentic mode, where the environment has a huge impact on projectiles and the game gives you minimal information.\u00a0\n\nSniper Elite 5 releases on PS5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on May 26.

It's also partially a case of not fixing something that isn't broken. In fact, a lot of The Quarry will be familiar to anyone who's played Supermassive's other games: 2015's Until Dawn or the three games of the ongoing Dark Pictures anthology series. Supermassive has a pretty specific formula that works for its brand of cinematic adventure game, and it doesn't deviate from it with The Quarry--meaning that if you like its other games, you should have a fun time with this one.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNr_pjnMXBQ", "date_published": "2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Modern Warfare 2 Release Date Confirmed, More Info Coming | GameSpot News", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 gets an official release date, Battlefield 2042 winding down Hazard Zone mode, and Apex Legends players on Xbox suffer from cheaters.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #ModernWarfare2 #Battlefield2042\u00a0\n\nActivision has revealed the release date of October 28, 2022 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in a new trailer.
