but they are now going down.

US omicron variants

BA.2, 39%
BA.2.12.1, 58%
Less common omicron derivatives
Others, 0.1%
Delta, 0%

Risk of re-infection

Risk of re-infection, eight times higher in Omicron times (20 December 2021 onwards), 

compared with Delta times, (17 May to 19 December 2021)

Deaths

COVID-19 is mentioned on fewer death certificates than flu and pneumonia

But, more likely to be listed as the underlying cause of death

Number of deaths due to COVID-19, and flu and pneumonia, England and Wales, 1901 to 2021

COVID-19, 2020

Underlying cause of 73,766 deaths

COVID-19, 2021

Underlying cause of 67,258 deaths

Deaths due to flu and pneumonia, 1929 

Underlying cause of 73,212 deaths

Which is way higher than the UK figure

Latest UK figures

2.8% of the population, self-reported

Of those, 

73% symptoms at least 12 weeks

44% symptoms at least one year

Previously infected with SARS-CoV-2,

reported persistent symptoms

≥4 weeks after acute COVID-19

March 2020–November 2021

United States, aged ≥18

Incidence of 26 conditions often / previously attributable to post-COVID

Among all patients aged ≥18 years

38% of case-patients experienced an incident condition

16% of controls

18–64 years

35.4% of case-patients experienced at least one incident condition

14.6% of controls experienced at least one incident condition

Aged ≥65 years

45.4% of case-patients experienced at least one incident condition

18.5% of controls experienced at least one incident condition.

Survivors aged 18–64

One in 5

Survivors aged ≥65

One in 4

experiencing an incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19

Conditions affected multiple systems

cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric signs and symptoms

Highest risk ratios (RRs)

Acute pulmonary embolism

18 to 64, RR = 2.1

≥65, RR = 2.1

RR = 2.1 and 2.2 among persons aged 18–64 and ≥65 years, respectively) and 

Respiratory signs and symptoms

RR = 2.1 in both age groups

Critical to reducing the incidence and impact of post-COVID

Implementation of COVID-19 prevention strategies

Routine assessment for post-COVID conditions

is critical to reducing the incidence and impact of post-COVID

The research study

A retrospective matched cohort design

March 2020–November 2021

63.4 million unique adult records

110 data contributors in the 50 states

Case-patients, 353,164
Control patients, 1,640,776

Case-patients or control patients with a previous history of one of the included conditions were excluded

No significant difference

Cerebrovascular disease

Mental health conditions

Substance-related disorders

Differences by age group were noted

RR for cardiac dysrhythmia

18 to 64, RR = 1.7

≥65, RR = 1.5

Musculoskeletal pain

18–64, RR = 1.6

≥65, RR = 1.4

RRs for 10 incident conditions, significantly higher among those aged ≥65

Renal failure, thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, muscle disorders, neurologic conditions, and mental health conditions (including mood disorders, anxiety, other mental conditions, and substance-related disorders

Limitations

Patients infected with recent variants

Acute COVID-19 infection might be biased toward a population that is seeking care

COVID-19 vaccination status was not considered in this analysis
