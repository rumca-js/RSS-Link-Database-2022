The founder and CEO of Living Waters, Ray Comfort, is in the studio with guys from The Babylon Bee to talk about evangelism, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and how he would have handled that Elon Musk interview a bit differently. Ray tells Kyle Mann and Adam Yenser all about his lifeâ€™s work of talking to strangers on the street and why you should never leave home without a stack of gospel tracts.

Ray can be seen on Living Waters on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/thewayofthemaster

And his TV show Way of the Master: https://www.livingwaters.com/outreach/way-of-the-master/
