'Cause I'm tired\nJust wait 'til we get stronger, then we'll fly again\nSome people want adventure and let their heart out\nSome people bottle up in Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara)\n\nAnd now we're stuck in this bungalow park\nBut your silly words keep me out of the dark\nWe're getting high on your father's whiskey\nI'm so happy you're with me, just glad that you're with me\nBack at this old little house at the bay\nWe never cared 'bout the world anyway\nNothing but gray skies from here to the city\nI'm happy you're with me, just glad that you're with me\n\nAnd I'm happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\n\nAnd now we're stuck in this bungalow park\nBut your silly words keep me out of the dark\nWe're getting high on your father's whiskey\nI'm so happy you're with me, glad that you're with me\nBack at this old little house at the bay\nWe never cared 'bout the world anyway\nNothing but gray skies from here to the city\nI'm happy you're with me, just glad that you're with me\n[Post-Chorus: Benny Sings, Nataly Dawn]\nAnd I'm happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy you're with me\nI'm so happy\n\nSanta Barbara\nSanta Barbara", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svqEHp25Y7M", "date_published": "2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
