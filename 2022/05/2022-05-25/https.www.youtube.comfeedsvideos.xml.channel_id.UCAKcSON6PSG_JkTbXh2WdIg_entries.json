Not only did the band perform for 8,000 fans in their hometown, they also glimpsed a dream come true: a Hippo Campus star on First Avenue\u2019s exterior wall.\n\nDespite the pandemic and all else, the members of Hippo Campus have had a lot to celebrate over the past few years. They\u2019d planned to take a break from touring and write their next album starting in late 2019, but those months turned into years of settling back into the Twin Cities scene and even producing music for younger artists. \u201cThis record is the first time we got to be dead [as Hippo Campus],\u201d Luppen says. \u201cI finally got to live in reality.\u201d\n\nHippo Campus\u2019s third album, LP3, came out at long last earlier this year. Three of its earliest tracks \u2014 the ones that helped shape its sound \u2014 are \u201cRide Or Die,\u201d \u201cBang Bang,\u201d and \u201cAshtray.\u201d Those are the tunes they performed at The Current\u2019s studio this month.\n\nThere\u2019s lots more to learn from Ayisha Jaffer\u2019s interview with Jake Luppen and Zach Sutton of Hippo Campus.
