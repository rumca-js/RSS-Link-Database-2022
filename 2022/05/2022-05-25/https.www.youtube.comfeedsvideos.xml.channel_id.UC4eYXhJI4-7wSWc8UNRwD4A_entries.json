Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nKara Frame | May 25, 2022\nSvaneborg Kardyb\u2019s Tiny Desk (home) concert was recorded in the countryside of Djursland, Denmark. \u201cYou have to drive for a while on a gravel road, and then you come to a lovely old house surrounded by hills and a stream on one side and a very flat landscape on the other, where you can see 10 miles away,\u201d the band wrote to us, describing the location of the shoot. It\u2019s this place that inspired Svaneborg Kardyb\u2019s second album, Haven. \u201c\u2018Haven\u2019\u201d (means garden in Danish). Haven celebrates places we like to be,\u201d the duo writes.\n\nThe Danish jazz duo is composed of Nikolaj Svaneborg \u2014 on the Wurlitzer, synthesizer and piano, and Jonas Kardyb \u2014 on drums and percussion. Their instrumentation set-up is untraditional, with the drums and keys facing each other, a position that they play in on stage just as they do in Jonas\u2019 kitchen and living room here. They open up their set with the title track from Haven, which begins with a quiet melody over an effervescent loop. The sound mimics the shimmy of leaves in the breeze. \n\nThis concert is the soundtrack for lying beneath a tree canopy and watching the sun illuminate each leaf, seeing the veins clearly as the sun makes its way down to reach each branch. Immersing yourself in nature is grounding, which is reflected in Jonas\u2019 last line describing their (home) concert: \u201cThe countryside reminds you that it is lovely to place both feet in the grass.\u201d\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Haven\"\n\"Et Lite \u00d8yeblikk Bare\"\n\"Orbit\"\n\"Terrassed\u00f8r\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNikolaj Svaneborg: Wurlitzer, synthesizer, piano\nJonas Kardyb: drums, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Kristoffer Juel Poulsen \nAudio: Simon Wetterstr\u00f8m Mariegaard\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Kara Frame\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Michael Zamora, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #SvaneborgKardyb", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1mg0yLDzvU", "date_published": "2022-05-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
