Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | May 9, 2022\nIdeally, musicians recording Tiny Desk (home) concerts adhere to the series\u2019 core concept and perform behind some sort of desk, tiny or otherwise. But, barring that, it helps to make bookshelves your backdrop. When Aoife O\u2019Donovan assembled her band at Portsmouth Book & Bar in Portsmouth, N.H., she made sure to note her surroundings: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here, surrounded by all these books.\u201d\n\nThe Bostonian singer-songwriter, who these days splits her time between a solo career and her work with the Grammy-winning supergroup I\u2019m With Her, has a sound nicely suited for bookish locales: O\u2019Donovan\u2019s warm folk-pop music conjures memories of the Northeast folk boom of the \u201990s, the soaring plaintiveness of Indigo Girls and the winsome lilt of modern bluegrass, elevated by a voice that\u2019s searching and friendly.\n\nBacked by guitarist and singer Isa Burke (from the band Lula Wiles), bassist Ethan Jodziewicz (who\u2019s toured with The Milk Carton Kids and others) and drummer Robin MacMillan, O\u2019Donovan performed four songs from her gorgeous new album Age of Apathy. For the title track, they were joined by Virginia\u2019s Yasmin Williams \u2014 herself a Tiny Desk veteran, not to mention one of the most inventive and surprising guitarists around.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cB61\u201d\n\u201cElevators\u201d\n\u201cPhoenix\u201d\n\u201cAge of Apathy\u201d (feat.
