Bill Gates has called for a global surveillance team to spot future pandemic threats – and potentially enact lockdowns - and by coincidence, he’d be in charge. No issues there then. #BillGates #Pandemic #Covid

This week I spoke to Prof. Brian Cox, live from his hotel room in Toronto where he’s on tour. We talked about the importance of understanding the cosmos, how science plays out in politics. #BrianCox #Pandemic #Covid
