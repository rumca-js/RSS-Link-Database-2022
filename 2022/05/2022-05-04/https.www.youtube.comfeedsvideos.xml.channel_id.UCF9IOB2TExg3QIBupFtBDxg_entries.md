Paper FDA EMU was based on

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542

EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients)

1120 patients received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir

1126 received placebo

Relative risk reduction

Risk of progression to severe Covid-19, 89% lower than the risk with placebo

Absolute risk reduction

7% down to 1%

symptomatic, unvaccinated, non hospitalized adults

at high risk for progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019

July 16 and December 9, 2021

If vaccinated people and previously infected people are partly protected

More people would need to be treated to prevent one adverse event

PAXLOVID™ for Post-Exposure Prophylactic Use

https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-shares-top-line-results-phase-23-epic-pep-study

Evaluated data from 2,957 adults

Pfizer observed risk reductions of 32% (5 day course)

37% reduction (10 day course)

These results, however, were not statistically significant and, as such, the primary endpoint of reducing the risk of confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19 infection in adults who had been exposed to the virus through a household contact was not met.
