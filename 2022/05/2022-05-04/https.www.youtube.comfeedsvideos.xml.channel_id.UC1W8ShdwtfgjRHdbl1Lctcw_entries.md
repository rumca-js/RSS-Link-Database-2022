I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of shot around New York City nearly 100 years ago, highlight a wide range of New York City icons and landmarks, from Times Square to Chinatown. Some, like the gothic Woolworth Building, haven't changed since then. Others, like swimsuit-filled Coney Island

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur,deflicker) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
