Trek to Yomi is a stunning representation of classic Japanese cinema that draws heavily from the work of Akira Kurosawa. However, it's also a case of style over substance.

LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga adds Bad Batch and Mandalorian season 2 characters, Halo Infinite's Battle Rifle Is Now Better In Ranked Than Social Games and Apex Legends Character Releases May Slow Down.

In celebration of Star Wars Day, WB Games have launched two new DLC packs for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. One of the packs, The Mandalorian Season 2, features characters like Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand and Moff Gideon. The other pack, Star Wars: The Bad Batch, features characters includes Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo

The "buff" for the Battle Rifle's melee in the ranked playlist essentially keeps the weapon performing as it was in Season 1 following the otherwise universal 10% melee damage reduction introduced as part of Season 2.

In an interview with Dexerto, the game’s senior character designer Devan McGuire explained that while Apex Legends is more about movement and firearms than legend abilities, those abilities can still unbalance the game as it becomes more difficult to create characters who are "unique, without being too overpowered or niche" with each passing season.
