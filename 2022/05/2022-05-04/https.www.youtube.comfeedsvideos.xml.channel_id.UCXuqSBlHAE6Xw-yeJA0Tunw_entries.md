The Sony GDM FW-900 is one of the greatest monitors ever made with its widescreen aspect ratio and an incredibly high rated resolution (for the time) this 20-year-old retro beast puts many modern gaming displays to shame! What makes this thing so special, and why did Linus spend so much money on it?
