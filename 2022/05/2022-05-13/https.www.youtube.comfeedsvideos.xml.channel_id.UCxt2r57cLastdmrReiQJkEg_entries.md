In this month’s video, we’re looking at how the political right uses a network of fake research institutes and experts to shape the news.

Organisations such as the Adam Smith Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Institute of Economic Affairs have the appearance of respected, academic institutions. But are they really? Well... no.

Funded by large corporations (including the climate denialists at big oil and tobacco companies) and super-rich libertarians such as Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos, these organisations are little more than propaganda fronts which exist solely to produce “research” which furthers the agendas of their funders.

Often referred to as “think tanks”, these organisations have had a number of key successes in influencing our collective political discourse over recent years: debates surrounding “Critical Race Theory”, immigration policy and the UK’s process of leaving the European Union have all been significantly influenced by these groups.

But, where did these organisations come from? How did they gain such a stranglehold on our politics? And how can we be more astute in spotting their tactics?
