Alleged Silent Hill screenshots get taken down by copyright claim and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel may be called Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 
#GamingNews #SilentHill #StarWars

Four alleged Silent Hill images leaked by a Twitter user called Aesthetic Gamer have since been taken down by a DMCA request. In their original tweet, Aesthetic Gamer wrote that their source had given them enough proof to believe the shots were real. Over on ResetEra, Aesthetic Gamer also claimed that Sony is still involved and that Konami was the one who filed the DMCA.

The Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel, according to Grubbsnax host Jeff Grubb, will have the subtitle Survivor. A sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was confirmed by EA and Star Wars back in January, when the companies announced that Respawn would be leading development on three upcoming Star Wars titles.

While much of Elden Ring initially would seem to focus on the Erdtree and Golden Order, the Academy of Raya Lucaria is just as major of a faction to the overall story and lore of Elden Ring. From Raya Lucaria's founding astrologers to Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, sorcerers from Caria and Sellen have had a major impact on the history of the Lands Between. Today, we'll focus on Rennala and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

#Elden Ring #EldenRingLore #RennalaLore #Rennala

Today, we’ll discuss a prodigy who would become a Queen and a school influenced by the stars. It all began with those who would look up at the stars above.“ Astrologers, who preceded the sorcerers, established themselves in mountaintops that nearly touched the sky, and considered the Fire Giants their neighbors.”

We can find remnants of the Astrologers looking out at the stars all over the Lands Between, via crescent bowl shaped monuments or, perhaps moondials setup on mountains and cliffsides that collect Starlight Shards.

While I’m not certain of the exact purpose of these, one is found on an altar in the Royal Moongazing Grounds of Caria Manor - indicating that it was incredibly important to astrologers. Considering they do look so similar to Sun Dials, it could be that these served a similar purpose… but for the moon. As Starlight Shards are regularly found in these, perhaps they were used for that very purpose.
