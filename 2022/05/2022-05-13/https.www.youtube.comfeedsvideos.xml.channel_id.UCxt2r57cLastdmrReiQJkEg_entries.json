But are they really? Well... no.\n\nFunded by large corporations (including the climate denialists at big oil and tobacco companies) and super-rich libertarians such as Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos, these organisations are little more than propaganda fronts which exist solely to produce \u201cresearch\u201d which furthers the agendas of their funders.\n\nOften referred to as \u201cthink tanks\u201d, these organisations have had a number of key successes in influencing our collective political discourse over recent years: debates surrounding \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d, immigration policy and the UK\u2019s process of leaving the European Union have all been significantly influenced by these groups.\n\nBut, where did these organisations come from? How did they gain such a stranglehold on our politics? And how can we be more astute in spotting their tactics?\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\n\n#thinktanks #mediabias #tomnicholas", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n3Hq7XSBjA", "date_published": "2022-05-13 18:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
