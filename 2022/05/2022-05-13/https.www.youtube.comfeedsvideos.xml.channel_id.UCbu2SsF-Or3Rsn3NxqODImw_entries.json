In their original tweet, Aesthetic Gamer wrote that their source had given them enough proof to believe the shots were real. Over on ResetEra, Aesthetic Gamer also claimed that Sony is still involved and that Konami was the one who filed the DMCA.\n\nThe Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel, according to Grubbsnax host Jeff Grubb, will have the subtitle Survivor. A sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was confirmed by EA and Star Wars back in January, when the companies announced that Respawn would be leading development on three upcoming Star Wars titles.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:06 - Silent Hill\n01:50 - Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnRiiQIgSg0", "date_published": "2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elden Ring Lore - Rennala and the Academy of Raya Lucaria", "description": "While much of Elden Ring initially would seem to focus on the Erdtree and Golden Order, the Academy of Raya Lucaria is just as major of a faction to the overall story and lore of Elden Ring. From Raya Lucaria's founding astrologers to Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, sorcerers from Caria and Sellen have had a major impact on the history of the Lands Between. Today, we'll focus on Rennala and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.\n\n#Elden Ring #EldenRingLore #RennalaLore #Rennala\n\nToday, we\u2019ll discuss a prodigy who would become a Queen and a school influenced by the stars. It all began with those who would look up at the stars above.\u201c Astrologers, who preceded the sorcerers, established themselves in mountaintops that nearly touched the sky, and considered the Fire Giants their neighbors.\u201d\n\nWe can find remnants of the Astrologers looking out at the stars all over the Lands Between, via crescent bowl shaped monuments or, perhaps moondials setup on mountains and cliffsides that collect Starlight Shards.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not certain of the exact purpose of these, one is found on an altar in the Royal Moongazing Grounds of Caria Manor - indicating that it was incredibly important to astrologers. Considering they do look so similar to Sun Dials, it could be that these served a similar purpose\u2026 but for the moon. As Starlight Shards are regularly found in these, perhaps they were used for that very purpose.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHb0xaCP0aQ", "date_published": "2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "GROOVY! | Evil Dead: The Game Livestream", "description": "Ben and Jean-Luc load up their boomsticks and check out the launch of Evil Dead: The Game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNkBW9AV8cM", "date_published": "2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Starfield Delayed, Dead Space Release Date Confirmed | GameSpot News", "description": "Starfield and Redfall Delayed To 2023, Dead Space gets an official release date, Call of Duty\u2019s mobile Warzone is officially revealed and Sony has reportedly registered a new PS5 model.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #Starfield #DeadSpace\n\nTwo of the studio\u2019s major games, Starfield and Redfall, have been delayed to 2023.
