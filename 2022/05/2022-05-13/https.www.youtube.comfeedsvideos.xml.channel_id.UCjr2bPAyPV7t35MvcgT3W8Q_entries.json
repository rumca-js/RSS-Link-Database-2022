More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. \n\nExperts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.\n\nIf Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world\u2019s first Splinternet. \n\nSources\n[0] https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-computer-networking.html\n[1] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/effect-2012-02-25-en\n[2] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en\n[3] https://techonomy.com/welcome-to-the-splinternet/\n[4] https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution\n[5] https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047352/russia-splinternet-risk/ \n[6] https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/tech/ukraine-russia-internet-icann/index.html\n[7] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/russia-internet-isolation-accelerates-after-ukraine-invasion\n[8] https://fortune.com/2022/03/22/russia-war-ukraine-great-firewall-splinternet-internet/\n[9] https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-disconnected-global-internet-tests-rbc-daily-2021-07-22/ \n[10] https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-cloud-idUSN1E7A727Q20111109\n[11] https://www.statista.com/topics/4418/amazon-web-services/\n[12] https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/ \n[13] https://about.facebook.com/meta \n[14] https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html\n[15] https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/\n[16] https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship\n[17] https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html?\n[18] https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-says-it-has-suspended-all-operations-russia-2022-03-02/\n[19] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-splinternet-014035581.html\n[20] https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles\n[21] https://qz.com/1194566/google-is-finally-admitting-it-has-a-filter-bubble-problem/\n[22] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-walls-are-closing-in-chinafinds-new-ways-to-tighten-internet-controls/2017/09/26/2e0d3562-9ee6-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html\n[23] https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/the-splinternet-is-already-here/\n[24] https://www.ft.com/content/ba94c2bc-6e27-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\nPeer-to-peer services\nBriar: https://briarproject.org/\nCwtch: https://cwtch.im/\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6QwK9EpN5M", "date_published": "2022-05-13 10:48:15+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["internet", "all time"]}]
