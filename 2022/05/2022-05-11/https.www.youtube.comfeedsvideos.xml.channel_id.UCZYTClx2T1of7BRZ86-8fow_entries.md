Thanks to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and their research and technology partner MBARI for partnering with us on this episode of SciShow. They worked together on an exhibition, “Into The Deep: Exploring Our Undiscovered Ocean,” to give visitors to the Aquarium a rare look at some of the animals that thrive in the least-explored area of the planet, the deep sea! Head to https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/into-the-deep to learn more or follow them on their social media. 

If you had to spend your entire life swimming through water, never touching the ground, you’d probably get pretty dang good at swimming. This is what life is like for the gossamer worm, and why its abilities could be inspiring new marine robots.

Carbon dating is a lot more than just getting the age of a dinosaur bone. We can learn a lot about the world through its use, and it turns out, we have.
