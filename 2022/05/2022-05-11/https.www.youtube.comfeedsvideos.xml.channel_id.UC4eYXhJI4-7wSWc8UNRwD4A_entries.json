Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnn Powers | May 12, 2022\n\"Tiny Desk at home? I kinda live on the road!\" the legendary Buffy Sainte-Marie exclaims one song into her high-spirited set recorded a few miles outside Toronto at the beginning of the 81-year-old's umpteenth tour. Sainte-Marie has always been a wandering soul with a fierce sense of direction. The four songs she performs here with her touring band span her nearly 60-year career, connecting her righteous protest songs \u2013 including \"Universal Soldier,\" as relevant today as it was when it became an anthem during the Vietnam War \u2013 to the love songs that have soundtracked countless slow dances. This set is a kind of Sainte-Marie primer, touching on her early days as the 1960s folk revival's brashest innovator and her mid-career turns writing country and pop hits like this set's smooth closer, \"Up Where We Belong,\" which won her an Academy Award for best original song in 1983.\n\nPlaying a Yamaha \"Silent Guitar,\" designed for road conditions where playing on headphones might be a requirement on a tour bus, and then switching to a small keyboard, Sainte-Marie is an easeful band leader. This occasion was, in fact, her first reunion with her touring band since the pandemic began, and their joy in playing these songs is palpable. Check out Matt Starr's rolling drum fills on \"It's My Way\" and bassist Mark Olexson's tender twinning with Sainte-Marie's guitar on \"Until It's Time for You to Go.\" But mostly, revel in Sainte-Marie's inimitable spirit, one of the greatest sparks popular music has ignited.\n\nSET LIST\n\"It's My Way\"\n\"Until It's Time for You to Go\"\n\"Universal Soldier\"\n\"Up Where We Belong\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBuffy Sainte-Marie: vocals, guitar, keys\nMatt Starr: drums\nMark Olexson: bass, vocals\nAnthony King: guitar, vocals\nKibwe Thomas: keys,vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Stephen Paniccia\nDirector of Photography: Andy Hourahine\nCamera Operator: Blair Johannes\nCamera Operator: Jack Hourahine\nCamera Assistant: Arani Muthucumarasamy\nSound Engine: Carm Milioto\nSound Mixer: Chris Birkett\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, NPR Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #BuffySainteMarie", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAisFnH3Vro", "date_published": "2022-05-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "ARC Ensemble: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | May 11, 2022\nThe conflicts between Russia and Ukraine reach far and wide, even deep into this Tiny Desk (home) concert performed by the ARC Ensemble \u2014 artists from Canada's Royal Conservatory in Toronto. They offer music by the neglected composer Dmitri Klebanov, a Ukrainian Jew whose career was sidelined by the Stalin regime when his First Symphony was denounced in 1949.\n\nKlebanov wrote his Fourth String Quartet \u2014 from which the ensemble plays excerpts \u2014 three years earlier. He dedicated it to his compatriot, the composer Mykola Leontovych who, as a Ukrainian separatist, was murdered by the Soviet secret police in 1921.\n\nThe opening movement will sound familiar. Klebanov riffs on a Leontovych melody best known in the West as the Christmas chestnut \"Carol of the Bells.\" The sparkling second movement, played largely in pizzicato, again draws from a Leontovych tune, this time inspired by the Hungarian bagpipe. Listen for the wheezy drone in the viola.\n\nTo introduce the final, folk music-inspired section, cellist Tom Wiebe recalls stories from his Ukrainian grandfather. As a musician, he formed an ensemble of string players who stuck together through the Russian Revolution and the following civil war. They even played, reluctantly, for Soviet Red Army soldiers who occupied their village. Wiebe's parents left Ukraine in the 1920s and settled in Canada.\n\nThe ARC Ensemble dedicates this performance to the people of Ukraine.\n\nSET LIST\nDmitri Klebanov: String Quartet No. 4\n\nI.
