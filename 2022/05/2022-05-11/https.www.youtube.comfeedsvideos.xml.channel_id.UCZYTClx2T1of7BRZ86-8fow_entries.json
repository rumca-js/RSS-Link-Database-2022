They worked together on an exhibition, \u201cInto The Deep: Exploring Our Undiscovered Ocean,\u201d to give visitors to the Aquarium a rare look at some of the animals that thrive in the least-explored area of the planet, the deep sea! Head to https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/into-the-deep to learn more or follow them on their social media. \n\nIf you had to spend your entire life swimming through water, never touching the ground, you\u2019d probably get pretty dang good at swimming. This is what life is like for the gossamer worm, and why its abilities could be inspiring new marine robots. \n\nHosted by: Hank Green\n\nSciShow is on TikTok!
