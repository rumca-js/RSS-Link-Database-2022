Mortality is higher among children and young adults, and immunocompromised individuals are especially at risk of severe disease. 

Most people recover within weeks. 

Most cases presented with lesions on the genitalia or peri-genital area, indicating that transmission likely occurs during close physical contact during sexual activities.

They haven’t told me the level of exposure yet, but it is something that everybody should be concerned about

We’re working on it hard to figure out what we do and what vaccine may be available
But it is a concern in the sense that if it were to spread it would be consequential

everybody should be concerned about the rise in cases

92 confirmed cases outside Africa in the current outbreak

Massachusetts, Florida, New York City 

https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/treatment.html

Currently, there is no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox virus infection. 

For purposes of controlling a monkeypox outbreak in the United States, smallpox vaccine, antivirals, and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) can be used.

Spain

Cases, 30, most linked to,

Enrique Ruiz Escudero, cabinet minister for health

Superspreader event, adult sauna, Madrid

The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis...to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible

Contact tracing

Quarantine of close contacts

Belgium

3 cases inked to The Darklands Festival, Antwerp

There’s reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries (Festival organisers)

Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation Europe

As we enter the summer season in the European region, with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, 

I am concerned that transmission could accelerate, as the cases currently being detected are among those engaging in sexual activity,

and the symptoms are unfamiliar to many

Monkeypox is normally a virus that is hard to spread from one person to another, and this is the first time there has been sustained human to human transmission outside Africa. 

Bavarian Nordic, Bernard Hoet, (biotechnology company)

an undisclosed European country, order for vaccine doses

The reason why this vaccine was developed was to have a safe vaccine for stockpiling in case of outbreaks of smallpox. 

We are in contact with the UK authorities about the use of the vaccine.

An acute illness with fever  more than 38.3⁰C (101⁰F)

Chills

Intense headache

Prodromal lymphadenopathy

Back pain and muscle aches

Myalgia and intense asthenia

Followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash,

often beginning on the face (most dense),

and then spreading elsewhere on the body, 

including soles of feet and palms of hands. 

Symptomatic, then rash, 1 to 5 days after first symptoms

The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

(can look like chickenpox or syphilis)

Starts as raised spots, forming into fluid filled blisters, then scabs which fall off

Lesions can be very itchy or painful
