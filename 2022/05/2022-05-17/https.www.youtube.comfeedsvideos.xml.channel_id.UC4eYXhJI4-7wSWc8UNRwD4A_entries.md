The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

I first saw IDK perform in 2017. An infectious ball of energy, he captivated the audience with every vigorous bar and step; his personality filled the large stage that he only shared with a DJ.

There's a similar vibe at his (home) concert, actually recorded at his house, with a live audience of neighbors and friends and a palpable feeling of genuine hospitality and gratitude. Look at the deep blue paint on the walls IDK carefully selected, along with other adornments in his lovely Los Angeles home. Visually, the room is vivid yet calm, and sonically, his music has that same kind of feeling.

He starts with a lovely, slow version of "Puerto Rico," from his 2021 album USEE4YOURSELF. Its lush harmonies and dynamic swells get you ready to dance for his next song, "Taco," a house-influenced, gritty song from his new album produced by DJ prodigy Kaytranada. The album's title, Simple., references Simple City, a neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. He wants the world to know that the fix to helping disadvantaged Black communities isn't as "simple" as you think.

More songs from the new record keep the cool vibe going. Though a lyrical rapper, IDK shows his singing acumen on "Zaza Tree" and "Breathe," a musical adventure with the catchiest hook — "let me catch my breath" — and a stellar guitar solo from producer Mike Dean. "'Breathe' is the most ME song I've ever made," IDK wrote on Twitter earlier this month, "and for me It's proof that I'm still continuing to grow."

The set ends strong with "The Code," a continuation of his new signature sound of alluring jazz harmonies, hard bass and driving rhythms.

Ann Powers | May 17, 2022
Filmed in Chicago’s beautiful brick Irish American Heritage Center during a recent tour, this four-song set begins with Fontaines D.C. singer Grian Chatten in the stacks at the center’s library, playing a button accordion and singing the mordant ballad “The Couple Across the Way” as cellist Maureen Dunne and violist Isaac Henry accompany him. An emotional touchstone on the band’s latest album, "Skinty Fia," it’s a taste of an unfinished Fontaines project: the Irish group originally planned to release a double set with half traditionally-styled tunes and half the searing, atmospheric post-punk that makes this third LP the band’s best.

But we won’t stay here in the quiet, unsettled heart. Chatten ambles over to the library’s open area, where the band is set up alongside members of the Northwestern University Choir to perform “In ár gCroíthe go deo.” The eerie blend of the choir’s harmonies and the band’s droning, building rhythms moves this music from storytelling to poetry. The song is a keen: an Irish lament for a dead woman whose family wanted the song’s title phrase inscribed on her grave but were thwarted when officials in their English hometown demanded a translation. “Gone is the night, gone is the day,” Chatten sings through gritted teeth as the choir and his bandmates chant those lost Irish words. Another library corner offers a dynamic shift, as Carlos O’Connell leads the tender, drifting “Big Shot” with delicate keyboard. Then it’s back to the noise with “Nabokov” — the perfect tune for tearing up an archive — and a final surprise sends the set into happy chaos.
