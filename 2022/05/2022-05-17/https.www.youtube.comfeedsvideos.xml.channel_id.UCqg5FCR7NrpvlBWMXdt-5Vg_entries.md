Marty got to take a look at the new Saints Row and has thoughts about it, Nick just got back from Iceland and has plenty of stories to share, and KC has probably been watching anime again.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.

New episodes every Wednesday morning from 9 AM to 10:00 AM CT.
