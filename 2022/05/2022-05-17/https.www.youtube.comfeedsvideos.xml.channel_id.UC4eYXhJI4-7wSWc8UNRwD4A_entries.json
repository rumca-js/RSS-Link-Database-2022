Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSuraya Mohamed | May 18, 2022\nI first saw IDK perform in 2017. An infectious ball of energy, he captivated the audience with every vigorous bar and step; his personality filled the large stage that he only shared with a DJ.\n\nThere's a similar vibe at his (home) concert, actually recorded at his house, with a live audience of neighbors and friends and a palpable feeling of genuine hospitality and gratitude. Look at the deep blue paint on the walls IDK carefully selected, along with other adornments in his lovely Los Angeles home. Visually, the room is vivid yet calm, and sonically, his music has that same kind of feeling.\n\nHe starts with a lovely, slow version of \"Puerto Rico,\" from his 2021 album USEE4YOURSELF. Its lush harmonies and dynamic swells get you ready to dance for his next song, \"Taco,\" a house-influenced, gritty song from his new album produced by DJ prodigy Kaytranada. The album's title, Simple., references Simple City, a neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. He wants the world to know that the fix to helping disadvantaged Black communities isn't as \"simple\" as you think.\n\nMore songs from the new record keep the cool vibe going. Though a lyrical rapper, IDK shows his singing acumen on \"Zaza Tree\" and \"Breathe,\" a musical adventure with the catchiest hook \u2014 \"let me catch my breath\" \u2014 and a stellar guitar solo from producer Mike Dean. \"'Breathe' is the most ME song I've ever made,\" IDK wrote on Twitter earlier this month, \"and for me It's proof that I'm still continuing to grow.\"\n\nThe set ends strong with \"The Code,\" a continuation of his new signature sound of alluring jazz harmonies, hard bass and driving rhythms.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Puerto Rico\"\n\"Taco\"\n\"Zaza Tree\"\n\"Breathe\"\n\"The Code\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nIDK: vocals\nDeshaun Allen: drums, percussion\nRon Allen: bass\nDerek Gamlam: keys\nKyla Moscovich: trumpet, flugelhorn, percussion, background vocals \nBrooke Brewer: background vocals \nChelsea Miller: background vocals \nMike Dean: guitar \nObi Nwadije: percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: David Clair, Joe McGarry, Jason Arambulo\nAP: Mara Schele, Derek Griesbach\nDirector of Photography: Matthias Schubert \nCamera Operator: Austin Harris\nGaffer: Chris Walters\nColor: Emi Eck\nVideo Production: Special Order\nMusic Director: Brian London\nRecording Engineer: David Avetisian\nVocal Coach: Collin Boyd\nEngineer (Post Production): Eden Nagar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #IDK", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o63dR6rEs70", "date_published": "2022-05-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Fontaines D.C.: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnn Powers | May 17, 2022\nFilmed in Chicago\u2019s beautiful brick Irish American Heritage Center during a recent tour, this four-song set begins with Fontaines D.C. singer Grian Chatten in the stacks at the center\u2019s library, playing a button accordion and singing the mordant ballad \u201cThe Couple Across the Way\u201d as cellist Maureen Dunne and violist Isaac Henry accompany him. An emotional touchstone on the band\u2019s latest album, \"Skinty Fia,\" it\u2019s a taste of an unfinished Fontaines project: the Irish group originally planned to release a double set with half traditionally-styled tunes and half the searing, atmospheric post-punk that makes this third LP the band\u2019s best.\n\nBut we won\u2019t stay here in the quiet, unsettled heart. Chatten ambles over to the library\u2019s open area, where the band is set up alongside members of the Northwestern University Choir to perform \u201cIn \u00e1r gCro\u00edthe go deo.\u201d The eerie blend of the choir\u2019s harmonies and the band\u2019s droning, building rhythms moves this music from storytelling to poetry. The song is a keen: an Irish lament for a dead woman whose family wanted the song\u2019s title phrase inscribed on her grave but were thwarted when officials in their English hometown demanded a translation. \u201cGone is the night, gone is the day,\u201d Chatten sings through gritted teeth as the choir and his bandmates chant those lost Irish words. Another library corner offers a dynamic shift, as Carlos O\u2019Connell leads the tender, drifting \u201cBig Shot\u201d with delicate keyboard. Then it\u2019s back to the noise with \u201cNabokov\u201d \u2014 the perfect tune for tearing up an archive \u2014 and a final surprise sends the set into happy chaos.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cThe Couple Across The Way\u201d\n\u201cIn \u00e1r gCro\u00edthe go deo\u201d \n\u201cBig Shot\u201d \n\u201cNabokov\u201d \n\n\nMUSICIANS\nGrian Chatten: vocals, accordion\nCarlos O'Connell: guitar, keyboard\nConor Curley: guitar, backing vocals\nConor Deegan III: bass guitar, backing vocals\nTom Coll: drums\nMaureen Dunne: cello\nIsaac Henry: viola\n\nChoir:\nTom Avery\nJoe Blanchard\nEmily Ann Brooks\nPeter Carroll\nMartina Cavard Blanco\nMariana Leone\nMaddie Mazzella\nEmily Som\u00e9\nJackson Owen\nOlivia Whitmer\n\n\nCREDITS\nProduced and Directed by Jamie Fleischel and Josh Modell\nCameras by Corey Lillard, Matt Carroll, John Sedivy\nRecorded by Chris Butterworth\nMonitors by Mat Acreman\nAudio mixed by Dan and Orla Carey\nString arrangements by Violeta Vicci\nVocal Consultant: Melissa Foster\nThank you to the Irish American Heritage Center in Chicago\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, NPR Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #FontainesDC", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgMwGBtt4rE", "date_published": "2022-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
