Korg and Bjooks have teamed up for a new edition of Patch and Tweak which comes bundled with the Korg NTS-2 multi-function music tool. Also, I'm in the book, which I guess is pretty cool. Let's build the NTS-2 and check out how it works.

I've launched a new Bandcamp Backstage with exclusive uploads every month. Head on over here if you're interested: https://soundvision.bandcamp.com/backstage
