Jann - Promise tekst 

You said that you’ll be there when I get home 
You’ll do the laundry cook the meal for all 
But I smell neither garlic nor the cotton when I’m here 
All I hear is silence that you left when you disappeared 
Why didn’t you say 
That you wouldn’t stay with me forever 
Like then on a day you first met me 
I don’t even care why you had to leave baby 

You tear me apart 
Look how selfish you are 
Left me behind when 
I gave you my life 
Where are you now 
How am I supposed to tell them How 
And you promised that you wouldn’t leave before me 
Tell me why you couldn’t keep your promise 

I know that you can’t hear me like before 
But there are things I think you need to know 
The things that you would know If you’d just wait a little more 
But you don’t like to wait and now they think that it’s their fault 
Why didn’t you say 
That you wouldn’t stay with me forever 
Like then on a day you first met me 
I don’t even care why you had to leave baby 

You tear me apart 
Look how selfish you are 
Left me behind when I gave you my life 
Where are you now 
How am I supposed to tell them How 
And you promised that you wouldn’t leave before me 
Tell me why you couldn’t keep your promise
