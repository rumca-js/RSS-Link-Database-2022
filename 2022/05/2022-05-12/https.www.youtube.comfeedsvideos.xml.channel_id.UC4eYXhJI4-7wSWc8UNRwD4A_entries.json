Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnn Powers | May 12, 2022\n\"Tiny Desk at home? I kinda live on the road!\" the legendary Buffy Sainte-Marie exclaims one song into her high-spirited set recorded a few miles outside Toronto at the beginning of the 81-year-old's umpteenth tour. Sainte-Marie has always been a wandering soul with a fierce sense of direction. The four songs she performs here with her touring band span her nearly 60-year career, connecting her righteous protest songs \u2013 including \"Universal Soldier,\" as relevant today as it was when it became an anthem during the Vietnam War \u2013 to the love songs that have soundtracked countless slow dances. This set is a kind of Sainte-Marie primer, touching on her early days as the 1960s folk revival's brashest innovator and her mid-career turns writing country and pop hits like this set's smooth closer, \"Up Where We Belong,\" which won her an Academy Award for best original song in 1983.\n\nPlaying a Yamaha \"Silent Guitar,\" designed for road conditions where playing on headphones might be a requirement on a tour bus, and then switching to a small keyboard, Sainte-Marie is an easeful band leader. This occasion was, in fact, her first reunion with her touring band since the pandemic began, and their joy in playing these songs is palpable. Check out Matt Starr's rolling drum fills on \"It's My Way\" and bassist Mark Olexson's tender twinning with Sainte-Marie's guitar on \"Until It's Time for You to Go.\" But mostly, revel in Sainte-Marie's inimitable spirit, one of the greatest sparks popular music has ignited.\n\nSET LIST\n\"It's My Way\"\n\"Until It's Time for You to Go\"\n\"Universal Soldier\"\n\"Up Where We Belong\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBuffy Sainte-Marie: vocals, guitar, keys\nMatt Starr: drums\nMark Olexson: bass, vocals\nAnthony King: guitar, vocals\nKibwe Thomas: keys,vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Stephen Paniccia\nDirector of Photography: Andy Hourahine\nCamera Operator: Blair Johannes\nCamera Operator: Jack Hourahine\nCamera Assistant: Arani Muthucumarasamy\nSound Engine: Carm Milioto\nSound Mixer: Chris Birkett\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Michael Zamora\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, NPR Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #BuffySainteMarie", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAisFnH3Vro", "date_published": "2022-05-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
