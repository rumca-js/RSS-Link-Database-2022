Terra Luna is down -99.99% --- and the question is WHY?
Plenty of theories have circulated about the cause of LUNA's demise and most of the specific answers seem to be merely speculation.. however many people saw this coming. The question is how? I suggest 3 reasons you could've predicted TERRA LUNA / UST was going to fall apart.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
