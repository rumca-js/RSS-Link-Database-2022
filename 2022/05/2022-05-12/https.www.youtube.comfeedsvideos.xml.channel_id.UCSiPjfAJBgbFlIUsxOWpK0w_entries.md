LYRICS
Have you heard that the rapture is coming
Have you heard He’ll be calling your name
And you’ll fly like a bird into the heavens
And you’ll never be sad again

Have you heard that the rapture is coming
And that no one will be left behind
That He’ll cradle your head oh so softly
Like a child, like a child, like a child

What a wonderful sound
My Jesus in the sky
He has counted all your tears
Come and meet Him in the by and by

Have you heard that the rapture is coming
That He loves you for all that you are
That He’d make you again in a heartbeat
Every freckle and every scar

What a wonderful sound
My Jesus in the sky
He has counted all your tears
Come and meet Him in the by and by
