Kyle Mann is joined by The Babylon Bee’s own MJ and special guest Siaka Massaquoi. The trio discuss laaaaaame Democrats, the FBI confiscating MAGA hats, Gen Z being a weird generation, and more!

New editions of Bee Radio and Weakly News are here… and MJ answers questions from her Twitter followers. They all seem to like her but the rest of us have to deal with hate mail. Why do we keep getting these? You’re hurting our feelings, you guys. FROWNY FACE.

Siaka Massaquoi is also running for California office as representative of District 43! If you’re in that area try legally voting for him. He seems cool. And he’s black. Also, check out his What The Fact channel on...

The left, celebrities, and athletes will take money from China, but they sure don't like talking about China. Tap your foot to the hit song parody of "We Don't Talk About Bruno"!

Lyrics: 
Psaki/Biden
We don't talk about China, no, no, no!
We don't talk about China
It was inauguration day
We were getting ready and there wasn't a crowd at the mall
Fences all over the mall
China calls in per our mutual win
Corn Pop!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, Jen Psaki, go on!
China says, "We don’t detain…"
What’d those Chinamen tell us?
“Uighurs, or start COVID strains.”
Obama was a clean fella
We’ll circle back another day
Hunter took their pay, so they’re okay!
We don't talk about China, no, no, no!
We don't talk about China!

Disney
Hey! Grew to find a love of China silencing and censoring
I will always pander to their editing and murdering
I associate them with the sound of printing cash
Got a gay kiss? It’s a miss with the Chinese
Edit till we get it all approved by the commies
Grappling with policies we couldn't understand
Do you understand?

Dr. Anthony Fauci
5 foot 7 frame
Bat soup as a snack
All my function gains
Will all fade to black
Can’t hear beagles’ screams
Cause I surgically removed their vocal cords!We don't talk about China, no, no, no!
We don't talk about China

Eric Swalwell
Fang Fang told me she really loved me,
but the next day: GONE!

John Cena
我会说一点普通话
Wǒ huì shuō yīdiǎr pǔtōnghuà
医生一清冲
Yīshēng qīngchóng

Yvonne Tong
When I asked the WHO about Taiwan
my phone call went dead

Chorus
Your fate is sealed when your fortune cookie’s read!

Xi Jinping
I tell you that Taiwan and Hong Kong are in
China and someday be mine
I tell you that my power will grow like the
dragon that fly through the sky(Yes, Xi Jinping is on his way)

LeBron
They told me that their slaves would make me some nice Nike jerseys
If I shut up and dribble(It's like I hear him now)

Xi Jinping
U.S., I want not a sound out of you(It's like I hear him now,
I can hear him now)Donald J. Trump
Um, China...
Yeah, about that China...
I really told you all about China...
I had the the truth and the whole truth, China

(Donald Trump, you get out of here!)
(Get off Twitter)

Chorus
Don't talk about China!

Donald J. Trump
I warned you all about China!

Chorus
Not a word about China!

Donald J. Trump
I really warned you all about China!
