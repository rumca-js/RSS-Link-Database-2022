Percentage of people testing positive 

Week ending 30th April 2022

2.91% in England (1 in 35 people) 

4.33% in Wales (1 in 25 people) 

2.45% in Northern Ireland (1 in 40 people) 

3.55% in Scotland (1 in 30 people)

Evidence of natural immune protection

People were more likely to test positive, if they: 

had not previously been infected with COVID-19

(people previously infected were protected against infection)

travelled abroad in the last 28 days 

(air travel increases risk of infection)

reported being of White ethnicity

(non-white ethnicity protects against infection)

had not had contact with hospitals
 
(contact with hospitals protects against infection)

lived in less deprived areas 

(Living deprived areas protects against infection)

had not been living with a child aged 16 years or under 

(Living with an under 16 year old, decreases risk of infection)

(Not living with an under 16 year old increases risk of infection)

Deaths, week ending 29 April 2022

1,247 deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK

This is an increase from 1,247 deaths in the previous week (ending 22 April 2022). 

The risk of death involving COVID-19 was higher for disabled people

Risk was greater for more-disabled people than less-disabled people.  

Between 24 January 2020 and 9 March 2022

Risk of death in the disabled

Women

Times 1.6 higher for more-disabled women than for non-disabled women 

Men

Times 1.4 higher for more-disabled men than for non-disabled men

Less-disabled men and less-disabled women 

Times 1.3 higher compared with non-disabled men and non-disabled women

This risk for the disabled was largely unchanged across each wave of the pandemic

Proportion of death certificates where the death was due to COVID-19 that had a pre-existing condition, January to March 2022, England and Wales

ill-defined conditions, 23.2%

(This was the first time Diabetes was not the most common pre-existing condition since October to December 2020)

Chronic lower respiratory diseases,15.8%

Diabetes, 15.7%

Urinary system

Ischaemic heart disease
