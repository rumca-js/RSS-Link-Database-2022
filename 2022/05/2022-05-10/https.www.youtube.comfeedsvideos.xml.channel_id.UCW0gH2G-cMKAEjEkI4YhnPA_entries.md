I was recently invited by Amazon to go to London to take part in an event centered around the new series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.  This is my travel vlog from the entire trip, including seeing some of London's sights, our day trip to Oxford, and my thoughts and reactions to the footage we saw and the Q&A we had with the showrunners.

This is my first ever travel vid, so let me know in the comments if you'd enjoy similar videos on other Tolkien destinations/events!  I'm totally open to suggestions as well!

00:00-03:34 Day 1: London Sights
03:34-13:37 Day 2: Oxford
