During a Japanese investor Q&A this week, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa spoke about how the company plans to transition away from the Switch console in the future. In order to ensure it doesn’t lose its massive user base, Furukawa explained that Nintendo’s strategy is to provide services that also use Nintendo Accounts and other IP outside of gaming software.

Mario + Rabbits: Sparks of Hope, which was initially announced for 2022, has a new release window.  As part of Ubisoft's latest earnings briefing, the company confirmed that it has more games in development right now than ever before in its history, and this includes a handful of big-name games coming out in the next year April 1, 2022-March 31, 2023.

BioWare has responded to internet speculation that Commander Shepard will return in the next Mass Effect game, and it sounds like that is not going to be the case.
