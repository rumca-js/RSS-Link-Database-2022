According to VGC, which has seen the leaked files and first reported on them, hundreds of lines of dialogue spelling out most of the events and characters of Cyberpunk’s expansion have appeared online. The dialogue points to a datamined character named Songbird as the focus of the DLC. 
CD Projekt Red has announced that the latest installment in the Witcher saga has completed its "research phase" and is moving forward with development. This means that The Witcher 4 could be entering pre-production relatively soon, at which point CD Projekt Red will figure out the structure and scale of the game among countless other 

According to a SteamDB listing codenamed "Oregon", it contains tags and descriptions that match Returnal's world and gameplay mechanics. For example, it contains "Tower of Sisyphus," which is an endless mode that is part of the game's latest expansion, Returnal: Ascension.

Sniper Elite 5 brings a Hitman-esque sandbox to Rebellion’s series, so it’s time for you to learn tips and tricks about gun customization, how to survive invasions, why bottles are the funniest piece of kit, and more. 

Sniper Elite 5 is the latest World War II-focused sniping game from developer Rebellion. It’s a game that sports massive Hitman-esque levels with tons of secrets, unlockables, and routes to find. Sniper Elite 5 also features extensive gun customization, with ammo types, scopes, wraps, trigger assemblies, and barrel attachments to swap out between missions or at weapon benches within each level. Players can build multiple load-outs to fit their playstyles. Because it’s a sandbox, there’s a lot to learn and plenty of things you probably didn’t know you could do.

In this video, we’ll show you 10 things we wish we knew before starting Sniper Elite 5. That means covering how powerful bottles really are in the game, why the 1911 pistol is one of the best starting weapons, why you should run through levels at first, and what weapon mechanics you should know about. Then, we’ll teach you how to survive player invasions, master the art of setting traps and distractions, use the overpowered melee to your best advantage, and even how to play if you don’t like stealth. Finally, we’ll take the most hardcore mil-sim players through the basics of Authentic mode, where the environment has a huge impact on projectiles and the game gives you minimal information. 

Sniper Elite 5 releases on PS5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on May 26. It has single-player, multiplayer, horde mode, and co-op, as well as cross-play.

Sniper Elite 5 emphasizes player agency with another thrilling sandbox that excels when you're looking down the scope.

## The Quarry Hands-on Preview

While The Quarry doesn't make any drastic changes to Supermassive's attitude to horror games, a strong cast and solid writing prove that approach still works just fine.

For The Quarry, the latest story-driven horror game from Supermassive Games, the campfire setup is partially an homage to '80s-era horror and teen slasher movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and of course, Friday the 13th. It's also partially a case of not fixing something that isn't broken. In fact, a lot of The Quarry will be familiar to anyone who's played Supermassive's other games: 2015's Until Dawn or the three games of the ongoing Dark Pictures anthology series. Supermassive has a pretty specific formula that works for its brand of cinematic adventure game, and it doesn't deviate from it with The Quarry--meaning that if you like its other games, you should have a fun time with this one.
