And it just shocked the conscience of the country.\u201d\n \nJoe Biden is the 47th president of the United States. At the time of this interview, he was vice president, serving under Barack Obama. Biden previously served as a U.S. senator from Delaware.\n \nThis interview was conducted by FRONTLINE\u2019s Jim Gilmore, on November 14, 2014, for the documentary \"Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA.\" The documentary, which originally aired in 2015, is an investigation into the NRA, its political evolution and influence, and how it has consistently succeeded in defeating new gun control legislation.
