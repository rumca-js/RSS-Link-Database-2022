In this interview from 2014, Joe Biden took FRONTLINE back to the days immediately after the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. “There were things I wouldn’t even say here on television, how gruesome what happened was to these little first-grade kids. And it just shocked the conscience of the country.”
 
Joe Biden is the 47th president of the United States. At the time of this interview, he was vice president, serving under Barack Obama. Biden previously served as a U.S. senator from Delaware.
