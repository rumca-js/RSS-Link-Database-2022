On the road to Arma 4, Arma Reforger is a standalone early access game looking to hook a new generation of Arma players as it goes into Early Access on PC and Xbox. 

Arma Reforger by Bohemia Interactive is a standalone Arma game going into Early Access while Arma 4 is in development. Reforger is intended to get the mil-sim community involved in testing out the new Enfusion engine, modding the game, coming up with fun combat scenarios, and fighting player vs. player. Reforger has two main multiplayer modes: Conflict, which sees two teams fighting over capture points, and Game Master, which lets players engage in and edit scenarios in real-time. The game also includes a Workshop that allows players to expand and modify the game. Mods can be used on both PC and, for the first time Xbox. Keep in mind the Arma Mod Day Z eventually led to PUBG and the modern battle royale craze. 

Arma Reforger takes place in a large open world on the island of Everon, set in the 1980s. The island’s design is inspired by the former state of Czechoslovakia. You’ll see a lot of classic ’80s guns in the game, like the M16A2, M21 SWS, and M72A3 Law. The game builds off the Arma series roots that started in 2001 with Arma: Cold War Assault and helped define the military simulation genre. 

Arma Reforger is part of the road to Arma 4 and is out now in Early Access for PC and Xbox.

YouTuber and developer Enfant Terrible, alside a number of other artists, put together a reimaging of Cyberpunk 2077's Night City within Epic's software. The artists used environment megapacks from the Epic Marketplace to recreate Night City and populated it with characters from Epic's the MetaHumans Creator.

Back in March 2022, Take-Two Interactive rolled out GTA+, an optional paid subscription service for GTA Online. The initial announcement was met with some mixed reactions from fans, but according to Take-Two, the service is apparently doing well. In a recent earnings call for the fiscal period that ended on March 31, CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company is "thrilled" with the number of players who've signed up for GTA+

Soulsborne content creator Garden of Eyes has created a mod that pits the game's various bosses against one another, and it's clear in a new video from the creator that Malenia is a cut above the rest.
