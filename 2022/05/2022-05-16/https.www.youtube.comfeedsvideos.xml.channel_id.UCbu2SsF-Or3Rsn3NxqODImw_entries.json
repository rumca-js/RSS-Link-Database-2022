Reforger is intended to get the mil-sim community involved in testing out the new Enfusion engine, modding the game, coming up with fun combat scenarios, and fighting player vs. player. Reforger has two main multiplayer modes: Conflict, which sees two teams fighting over capture points, and Game Master, which lets players engage in and edit scenarios in real-time. The game also includes a Workshop that allows players to expand and modify the game. Mods can be used on both PC and, for the first time Xbox. Keep in mind the Arma Mod Day Z eventually led to PUBG and the modern battle royale craze.\u00a0\n\nArma Reforger takes place in a large open world on the island of Everon, set in the 1980s. The island\u2019s design is inspired by the former state of Czechoslovakia. You\u2019ll see a lot of classic \u201980s guns in the game, like the M16A2, M21 SWS, and M72A3 Law. The game builds off the Arma series roots that started in 2001 with Arma: Cold War Assault and helped define the military simulation genre.\u00a0\n\nArma Reforger is part of the road to Arma 4 and is out now in Early Access for PC and Xbox.\n\n#Arma4 #ArmaReforger #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYxuD7h2498", "date_published": "2022-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Fan Project In Unreal 5 Looks Amazing | GameSpot News", "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is recreated in Unreal Engine 5, GTA+ is off to a great start and Elden Ring's Malenia battles all other bosses thanks to a new mod.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #Cyberpunk2077 #EldenRing\n\nImagining the NEXT Cyberpunk 2077 - https://youtu.be/jOwNE60bbfU\nELDEN RING: Malenia VS All Bosses - https://youtu.be/pz7Rpce2cRc\u00a0\n\nYouTuber and developer Enfant Terrible, alside a number of other artists, put together a reimaging of Cyberpunk 2077's Night City within Epic's software.
