This week I spoke to Prof. Brian Cox, live from his hotel room in Toronto where he’s on tour. We talked about the importance of understanding the cosmos, how science plays out in politics. #BrianCox #Pandemic #Covid

The CDC bought data from tens of millions of phones to see if Americans followed lockdown orders, and wanted to use date for non-COVID-19 purposes too. But vaccine passports couldn’t possibly be used to spy on us… you conspiracy theorists! #CDC #Covid #Pandemic

Joe Biden has taken the fight against disinformation one step further, by setting up a new “Disinformation Governance Board”, or DGB – only one letter different from KGB… so nothing to worry about there. #JoeBiden #Disinformation #Misinformation
