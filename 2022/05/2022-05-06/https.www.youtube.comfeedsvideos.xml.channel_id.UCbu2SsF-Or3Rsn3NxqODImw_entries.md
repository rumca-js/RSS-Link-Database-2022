Video Notes: 
The upcoming release of Sniper Elite 5 provides a good opportunity to look at games with the best sniping mechanics that you can play right now. In this video, we cover a wide range of first-person shooters, including single-player, combined arms multiplayer games, and some pretty hardcore military sim titles. This list includes something for everyone, from casual to competitive and hardcore gamers. 

Games that get sniping right are actually a bit rare because creating good sniping experiences in video games is complicated. Sniping or even long-range shooting isn’t easy for developers to model and balance in video games. Real-world distance shooting involves so many factors like range, windage, and drag, which requires a decent amount of math to do correctly. Video games also aren’t that great at simulating the mindset snipers experience, like the stress and pressure they go through taking the perfect shot. Developers compromise in different ways for different audiences to make sniping in video games fun. 

We'll take a look at a variety of approaches to sniping, including games for more casual players, such as Sniper Elite, Sniper Ghost Warrior, and Hitman 2 Sniper Assassin. After that, we'll dial in on games with great sniping and bullet physics for competitive multiplayer fans, including Escape From Tarkov and Battlefield. Next, we'll hit the games for the hardcore crowd that give the most realistic experience possible, with toward Arma and Squad. Finally, we’ll give some thought to the pros and cons of sniping in virtual reality.

This video covers a host of games out now on PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Let us know what you’re favorite game is or if there’s one that we missed, and we’ll include it in future videos!

According to a report from Exputer, Modern Warfare 2’s reveal trailer could air "at an event when E3 was meant to be," and will focus on the campaign. Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer will be revealed in August. Whether or not there will be a tie-in Warzone event as part of the expected announcement is unknown.

Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries has acknowledged that the Season 2: Lone Wolves launch this week "has been bumpy," with players reporting a number of issues with the latest update. On Twitter, Microsoft's Joseph Staten said, “We are indeed taking your feedback to heart, especially regarding map jumps and speedrunning. We're reviewing options and will have more news to come."

THQ commissioned a gold-plated Nintendo Wii to be delivered to Buckingham Palace and presented to the Queen of England as part of a marketing stunt to promote Big Family Games. The previous auction started the bidding at $300,000, although this new auction's highest bid at the time of writing is currently $2,000 on the Goldin website.
