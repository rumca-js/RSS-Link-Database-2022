I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of home movie visits Coney Island , we see the boardwalk and the beach. Some rides, mostly of the parachutes. After that a car ride of the surrounding area. And then we wind up in some monument with some statues.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second

âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
