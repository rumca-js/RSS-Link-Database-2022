In this video, we cover a wide range of first-person shooters, including single-player, combined arms multiplayer games, and some pretty hardcore military sim titles. This list includes something for everyone, from casual to competitive and hardcore gamers.\u00a0\n\nGames that get sniping right are actually a bit rare because creating good sniping experiences in video games is complicated. Sniping or even long-range shooting isn\u2019t easy for developers to model and balance in video games. Real-world distance shooting involves so many factors like range, windage, and drag, which requires a decent amount of math to do correctly. Video games also aren\u2019t that great at simulating the mindset snipers experience, like the stress and pressure they go through taking the perfect shot. Developers compromise in different ways for different audiences to make sniping in video games fun.\u00a0\n\nWe'll take a look at a variety of approaches to sniping, including games for more casual players, such as Sniper Elite, Sniper Ghost Warrior, and Hitman 2 Sniper Assassin. After that, we'll dial in on games with great sniping and bullet physics for competitive multiplayer fans, including Escape From Tarkov and Battlefield. Next, we'll hit the games for the hardcore crowd that give the most realistic experience possible, with toward Arma and Squad. Finally, we\u2019ll give some thought to the pros and cons of sniping in virtual reality.\n\nThis video covers a host of games out now on PC, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.
