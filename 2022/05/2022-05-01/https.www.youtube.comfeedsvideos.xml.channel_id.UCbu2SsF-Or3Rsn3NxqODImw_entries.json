This is the tale and lore of Godrick the Grafted.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the first major boss of Elden Ring. A demigod and lord who despite his status, was laughed at behind his back, but would yearn for approval. Today, we\u2019ll discuss Godrick the Grafted and Stormveil Castle.\n\n#EldenRing #GodrickLore", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLvG2ySzwsI", "date_published": "2022-05-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Switch Sports Fans Are Smashing TVs Like It's 2006 | GameSpot News", "description": "Nintendo Switch Sports Is Leading To Smashed TVs, a modded toddler toy can play Elden Ring, and Square Enix Sells Tomb Raider, Deus Ex Studios And IP Rights To Embracer Group.\u00a0\n#GamingNews #SwitchSports #EldenRing\n\nNintendo Switch Sports players are reporting broken televisions due to Joy-Cons flying out of sweaty hands. This is similar to how the many TV screens were shattered this same way in the 2000s as a result of Wii Sport players losing their grip on the WiiMote.\n\nTwitter user Rudeism has modded the Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Game Controller to be a fully functional Xbox controller. Rudeism recently showed footage of the controller in action, using it to play Elden Ring on PC.\n\nEmbracer Group has announced that it has acquired Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, Square Enix Montreal, and a catalog of IPs from Square Enix.

Take its most recent update, The Contract, for example, not only did it pull in heavyweights Dr Dre and DJ Pooh, but also brought back GTA 5 protagonist Franklin.\n\nTo celebrate, we brought in Franklin's actor, Shawn 'Solo' Fonteno, to discuss what it was like making GTA 5, and to react to some of the game's most popular clips. In the above video, he describes what it was like to work with both the real and fake Chop the dog, his experience learning Franklin's role in the story, as well as the origins of the infamous Franklin gets roasted clip. \n\nCheck out Shawn's book here: https://sologamechanger.com/book/ \nhttps://twitter.com/Shawn_Fonteno \n\n#GTA5 #GrandTheftAuto5", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcX-RvyW4tk", "date_published": "2022-05-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What A Modern Warfare 2 Logo, Battlefield Redemption Arc, And Overwatch 2 Beta Means For Shooters", "description": "Call of Duty is bringing King Kong And Godzilla to Warzone Season 3, Overwatch 2 has a PvP beta live right now, and Battlefield 2042 seems ready for a redemption arc?
