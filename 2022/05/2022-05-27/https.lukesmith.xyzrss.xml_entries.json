[{"source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "Based.Cooking has become more grandma-usable.", "description": "<p>Over the past month, I&rsquo;ve taken some off-time to tinker with\n<a href=\"https://based.cooking\">Based.Cooking</a>, the cooking site I/we made a year or so\nago as a proof of concept for a simple and unintrusive recipe website. There\nhave been over 250 recipes submitted, but the hobbled-together static site\ngenerator originally used proved unable to keep up and with all the\nsubmissions, there was a big issue of content organization.</p>\n<p>There have been two big changes. Firstly, I ported the entire site to use Hugo,\nwhich I believe I mentioned already. Hugo is just a very fast static site\ngenerator written in Go, and I particularly liked it for the ease of tagging\narticles. Originally, the only content sorting on Based.Cooking was a tagcloud\nat the top of the main page and &ldquo;Related&rdquo; pages at the bottom of each page.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there had been a PR a while ago to add a search filter for the\nmainpage with a few lines of Javascript. I think it&rsquo;s actually a fantastic\nillustration of the few actually useful times to use scripting in a webpage,\nand it allows users to instantaneously to search existing recipes by title and\ntag without extra page loads and with handy responsive CSS.</p>\n<p>Note also that tags now can be assigned emojis (via CSS, weirdly enough). I&rsquo;m\njust playing around with this. It might be visually jarring for some, so I\nmight change it.</p>\n<p>I might make some more strides to make the site more normie-friendly, since I\nsee it more than a proof-of-concept. Keep in mind that the <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/based.cooking\">Github repo is\nhere</a> if you want to add recipes\nor suggest other changes. I had said earlier that I wanted to cut down on the\nacceptance of new recipes for fear of crowding the main page. This is less of\nan issue with the search filter, so feel free to submit whatever you think it\nworthy.</p>\n<p>If you cook something on the site without a photo (or at least without a <em>good</em>\none), feel free to submit that as well.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/based-cooking-hugo-search/", "date_published": "2022-05-27 12:32:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
