The Babylon Bee talks to repeat guest and fan favorite, Kira Davis, who is running for school board to save the kids from CRT, groomers, and mask mandates. They talk about what’s going on in the world this week like the tragic event in Texas, Nancy Pelosi being told she can’t have communion- we can’t believe it either!- and how monkeypox is totally not gay. The Bee also talks to rapper and songwriter Tom MacDonald about his non-woke music and what it’s like to be a normal guy with face tattoos.

It’s a packed episode with what’s banging and bombing on The Babylon Bee, love mail, hate mail, Weakly News with Adam Yenser, and Bee Radio from Austin Robertson. In the subscriber portion, Kira Davis answers questions directly from Bee subscribers.
