Computer operating systems are a security nightmare!\nSupport independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nIt has been the case for years that modern phone security models allow for a much greater protection of your sensitive data than any desktop offers today. There are plenty of problems with phones, many of which are totally unethical. But any issue you can criticize a modern phone for is several times worse on a desktop equivalent of it. \n\nBoth Android and iOS were designed with a thorough threat model in mind. Modern mobile operating systems implement defense in depth mechanisms that eliminate the ability of malicious software to access your sensitive data. Much of this is done via exploit mitigation, attack surface reduction and isolation. Isolation and containment is where the differences between desktop and mobile security models are most visible to the end user.\n\nMany zealots in the privacy community, if such a thing even exists, do not make a distinction between services and platforms. Android means a lot of completely unrelated things to a lot of different people. But in reality, Android is just a free and open source mobile operating system. It has no Google apps or services, no pre-installed bundles or bloatware.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make this distinction, because it\u2019s possible to use an Android device without any privacy invasive apps and services. The Android\u2019s model allows for it. \n\nAndroid is private and safe by default. It\u2019s best if you can use it without privacy invasive services, such as the Google Play Store. This is best achieved on GrapheneOS. But even if you can\u2019t use your phone without them, it\u2019s not all lost. You should still go through the privacy settings of each of these services and disable all the collection you are not comfortable with.\n\nIf you are buying a phone for privacy, Pixel phones from Google or the latest generation iPhones are gonna be your best bet. Pixel phones will let you go miles further than iPhones if you decide to flash GrapheneOS on them. That way your phone will be significantly protected against even unknown vulnerabilities and 0day exploits and it will completely anonymize your device. \n\nSources\n[1a] https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-must-face-siri-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-us-judge-2021-09-02/\n[1b] https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/google-sued-u-s-tracking-users-private-internet-browsing-n1222676 \n[1c] https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/31/windows-10-microsoft-faces-criticism-over-privacy-default-settings \n[2] https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/device-identifiers\n[3]https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview\n[4] https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore\n[5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05572.pdf\n[6] https://source.android.com/security/encryption\n[7] https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone\n[8] https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox\n[9] https://source.android.com/security/overview/app-security\n[10a] https://source.android.com/security/apksigning \n[10b] http://apps.testinsane.com/mindmaps/google-play-submission-tests-checks-human-interface-guidelines-mindmap\n[11] https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/\n[12] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204053\n[13] https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en\n[14] https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission\n[15] https://source.android.com/\n[16] https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play\n[17] https://safety.google/intl/en_us/privacy/privacy-controls/\n[18] https://grapheneos.org/features#improved-user-profiles\n[19] https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/  \n[20] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/technology/apple-child-abuse-tech-privacy.html \n[21] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT\n[22] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html\n[23] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\n[24] https://www.xda-developers.com/how-android-security-patch-updates-work/\n[25] https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en \n[26] https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices \n[27] https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/ \n[28] https://www.cyberscoop.com/ios-zero-day-zerodium-high-supply/\n[29] https://www.zerodium.com/program.html \n[30] https://www.wired.com/story/android-zero-day-more-than-ios-zerodium/ \n\nMusic by: White Bat Audio [Karl Casey]\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd4Pa03LvLk", "date_published": "2022-05-27 14:53:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
