By recording ultrasonic sounds and pitching them down into human range, we can get an idea of what these ultrasonic sounds are like (relatively at least). I bought several devices and gadgets to test, such as dog whistles, anti-barking gadgets, and ultrasonic pest repellers, to see what kind of ultrasonic noise they produce. \n\n\u25bc Time Stamps: \u25bc\n0:00 - Intro\n1:34 - The Special Microphone & Demo\n3:24 - About Recording Ultrasonic Sounds\n4:18 - The Test Subjects\n5:02 - Test: Dog Whistles\n6:05 - Test: Electronic Anti-Barking Devices\n8:04 - Test: First Pest Repeller\n9:48 - Test: Second Repeller\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nMerch \u21e8 https://teespring.com/stores/thiojoe\n\u21e8 http://Instagram.com/ThioJoe\n\u21e8 http://Twitter.com/ThioJoe\n\u21e8 http://Facebook.com/ThioJoeTV\nMy Gear & Equipment \u21e8 https://kit.co/ThioJoe\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RBz7DQbXLw", "date_published": "2022-05-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
