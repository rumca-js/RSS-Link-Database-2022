LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga adds Bad Batch and Mandalorian season 2 characters, Halo Infinite's Battle Rifle Is Now Better In Ranked Than Social Games and Apex Legends Character Releases May Slow Down.
#GamingNews #StarWars #HaloInfinite

In celebration of Star Wars Day, WB Games have launched two new DLC packs for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. One of the packs, The Mandalorian Season 2, features characters like Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand and Moff Gideon. The other pack, Star Wars: The Bad Batch, features characters includes Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo

A ranked-only melee buff for the Battle Rifle in Halo Infinite Season 2 has not gone over well with fans. The "buff" for the Battle Rifle's melee in the ranked playlist essentially keeps the weapon performing as it was in Season 1 following the otherwise universal 10% melee damage reduction introduced as part of Season 2.

In an interview with Dexerto, the game’s senior character designer Devan McGuire explained that while Apex Legends is more about movement and firearms than legend abilities, those abilities can still unbalance the game as it becomes more difficult to create characters who are "unique, without being too overpowered or niche" with each passing season.

In an interview with fan site Lega Hyrule (via Eurogamer), Ubaldi revealed that he had recorded new lines for Breath of the Wild 2, returning not only to the role of Daruk but also the Goron champion's ancestor. This has led fans to speculate that the ancestors of other Hyrulian champions--Revali, Mipha, and Urbosa--could potentially be encountered in Breath of the Wild 2

Ubisoft confirmed today that development has shifted from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, the original creators of the Sands of Time series. Whether or not the remake is being rebooted or if Ubisoft Montreal will continue working on what was already done is unknown.

Right now PlayStation Plus subscribers can grab this month's free games: Fifa 22, curse of the dead gods, and tribes of midgard. Over on Xbox and PC, Halo fans can jump into the new season of Infinite’s multiplayer called Lone Wolves.

In Warcraft Arclight Rumble you will see coin-operated machines appearing in taverns throughout Warcraft's setting of Azeroth. Here patrons can use miniature figurines of creatures and heroes to battle against one another in a simplified real-time strategy game. Players will collect minis, create armies, and use them in both story battles against the AI and multiplayer matches against other players. Similarly to how Hearthstone uses the tavern as its setting, only exchanging cards for minis. 

Open Beta is coming soon and the game will be coming to iOS and Android phones.
