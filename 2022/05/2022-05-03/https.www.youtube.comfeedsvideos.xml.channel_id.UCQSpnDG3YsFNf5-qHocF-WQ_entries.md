Ever wonder what a dog whistle actually sounds like to animals?

In this video I use a special microphone, the Sanken CO-100k that can record frequencies up to 100 kHz, way higher than typical microphones and human hearing, both of which usually top out at 20 kHz. By recording ultrasonic sounds and pitching them down into human range, we can get an idea of what these ultrasonic sounds are like (relatively at least). I bought several devices and gadgets to test, such as dog whistles, anti-barking gadgets, and ultrasonic pest repellers, to see what kind of ultrasonic noise they produce.
