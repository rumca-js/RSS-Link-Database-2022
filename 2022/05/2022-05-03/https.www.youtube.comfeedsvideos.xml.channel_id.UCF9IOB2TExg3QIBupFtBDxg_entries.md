Paxlovid, it this an evidence based intervention in May 2022?

Paper FDA EMU was based on

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542

EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients)

1120 patients received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir

1126 received placebo

Relative risk reduction

Risk of progression to severe Covid-19, 89% lower than the risk with placebo

Absolute risk reduction

https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/what-paxlovids-absolute-and-relative-covid-19-risk-reduction

7% down to 1%

symptomatic, unvaccinated, non hospitalized adults

at high risk for progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019

July 16 and December 9, 2021

If vaccinated people and previously infected people are partly protected

More people would need to be treated to prevent one adverse event

The results showed in all cases that nirmatrelvir was a potent inhibitor of its target.

PAXLOVID™ for Post-Exposure Prophylactic Use

https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-shares-top-line-results-phase-23-epic-pep-study

Evaluated data from 2,957 adults

Pfizer observed risk reductions of 32% (5 day course)

37% reduction (10 day course)

These results, however, were not statistically significant and, as such, the primary endpoint of reducing the risk of confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19 infection in adults who had been exposed to the virus through a household contact was not met.

The new White House Covid czar says avoiding all virus infections isn’t the goal of U.S. pandemic policy.

Relatively low number of new deaths, but still too high

Hospitalizations, lowest point in the pandemic

Rising number of cases, a promising inflection

With such a contagious virus spreading, hard to ensure that no one gets Covid in America

That’s not even a policy goal

The goal of our policy should be: obviously minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill

we are going to see cases go up and go down during this pandemic as we head into the weeks, months and years ahead

The more important reflections of progress, health care system strain,
whether people are hospitalized with and dying from Covid-19

There are some people in this country who sometimes think that we can take a domestic-only approach to a global pandemic

That’s not a thing. You can’t do that

Increased contagion

Dr. Janet Woodcock, FDA

It’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, 

which is, most people are going to get Covid

What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens
