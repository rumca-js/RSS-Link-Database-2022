One of the packs, The Mandalorian Season 2, features characters like Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand and Moff Gideon. The other pack, Star Wars: The Bad Batch, features characters includes Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo\n\nA ranked-only melee buff for the Battle Rifle in Halo Infinite Season 2 has not gone over well with fans. The \"buff\" for the Battle Rifle's melee in the ranked playlist essentially keeps the weapon performing as it was in Season 1 following the otherwise universal 10% melee damage reduction introduced as part of Season 2.\n\nIn an interview with Dexerto, the game\u2019s senior character designer Devan McGuire explained that while Apex Legends is more about movement and firearms than legend abilities, those abilities can still unbalance the game as it becomes more difficult to create characters who are \"unique, without being too overpowered or niche\" with each passing season.\n\nSTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - Star Wars\n01:42 - Halo Infinite\n03:01 - Apex Legends", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtbSnFq_nw", "date_published": "2022-05-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Top 10 Best Star Wars Games", "description": "If you\u2019ve got a hankering to play a game set in a galaxy far, far away then this video is for you, young Padawan.

Whether or not the remake is being rebooted or if Ubisoft Montreal will continue working on what was already done is unknown.\n\nRight now PlayStation Plus subscribers can grab this month's free games: Fifa 22, curse of the dead gods, and tribes of midgard.
