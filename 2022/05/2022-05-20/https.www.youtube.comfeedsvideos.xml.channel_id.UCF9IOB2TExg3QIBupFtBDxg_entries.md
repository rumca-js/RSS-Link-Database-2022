12th May, ECDC reclassified omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5 as VOCs

First detected in South Africa in January and February 2022

Now dominant in SA

Both lineages contain L452R, F486V, and R493Q in the spike receptor binding domain

Significant change in antigenic properties of BA.4 and BA.5 compared to BA.1 and BA.2

Portugal

BA.5, increasing trend in variant proportions

With increase in case numbers and test positivity rate

Portuguese National Institute of Health

BA.5 already accounted for ~37% of positive cases as of 8 May

Daily growth advantage for BA.5 over BA.2 is 13%

(SA estimated 12% daily growth advantage)

BA.5 will become the dominant variant in Portugal by 22 May 2022

Growth advantage for BA.4 and BA.5

Evade immune protection induced by prior infection and/or vaccination, 

particularly if this has waned over time

BA.4 and BA.5 are capable of escaping immune protection induced by infection with BA.1

No indication of any change in severity for BA.4/BA.5 compared to previous Omicron lineages.

These variants could cause a significant overall increase in cases in Europe

If COVID-19 case numbers increase substantially, some level of increased hospital

Countries should have plans in place for the rapid deployment of booster doses in these population groups.

Weâ€™re seeing this expansion of confirmed and suspect cases globally

We have a sense that no one has their arms around this to know how large and expansive it might be

Positive cases identified in the U.K., Portugal, and Spain (Sweden)

And we expect there will be others
